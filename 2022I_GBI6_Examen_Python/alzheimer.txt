AB  - Once a diagnosis of Alzheimer disease is established, a wide variety of therapy
      options are available to treat different stages of the disease. Patients have the
      opportunity to delay onset of the disease or delay its progression if diagnosed
      early enough through new FDA-approved disease-modifying treatments. For mild to
      moderate stages, new symptomatic treatments can slow the progression of the
      disease and improve symptoms. A multi-component approach is recommended in order 
      to tailor treatments to each patient's needs.

TI  - Add-On Pramipexole for the Treatment of Schizophrenia and Schizoaffective
      Disorder: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
LID - 10.4088/JCP.21m14233 [doi]
LID - 21m14233 [pii]
AB  - Objective: Several small clinical trials have reported that the dopamine agonist 
      pramipexole was beneficial in treating patients with schizophrenia. A
      confirmatory trial was conducted to test this hypothesis. Methods: This 16-week, 
      multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study included 200
      subjects meeting DSM-IV-TR criteria for schizophrenia or schizoaffective
      disorder. Patients were randomized to receive either pramipexole (0.75 mg twice
      daily, n = 100) or placebo (n = 100) as an add-on to their regular antipsychotic 
      treatment. The primary outcome measure was the total score on the Positive and
      Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS); secondary outcome measures included PANSS
      subscale and cognitive functioning scores. Recruitment was performed in 30 sites 
      in Romania and 1 site in the Republic of Moldova between January and June 2011.
      Results: Analysis of covariance models showed no significant difference between
      pramipexole and placebo for total PANSS (P > .99) and PANSS positive (P > .99),
      negative (P = .73), and general psychopathology (P = .99) subscale scores.
      Changes in Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale and Brief
      Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia scores showed no significant difference 
      between pramipexole and placebo. Conclusions: The results of this large
      randomized controlled trial indicated that pramipexole was not efficacious as an 
      add-on to antipsychotic medications for schizophrenia. Trial Registration:
      ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01320982.

LID - LI21019DH1C [pii]
AB  - Diagnosing early-stage Alzheimer disease can lead to prompt initiation of
      treatment and slow down symptom progression. However, clinicians are not
      providing a diagnosis to over half of individuals who meet criteria for dementia.
      Tests for biomarkers, new symptomatic treatments and disease-modifying agents,
      and the addition of the preclinical stage to the diagnostic criteria for AD can
      aid in earlier disease recognition and developing treatment plans. Communicating 
      diagnosis and information on next steps with patients and caregivers can lead to 
      patient and caregiver involvement in decision-making and planning as well as
      participation in clinical trials and maximizing benefits and lifestyle
      interventions.

TI  - Trazodone and patient outcomes in dementia-Limitations of naturalistic cohort
      data.
LID - 10.1002/gps.5777 [doi]
AB  - The unfolded protein response has been increasingly implicated as an important
      pathological pathway and target for therapeutic intervention in
      neurodegeneration. The licensed antidepressant trazodone is one drug which has
      been proposed to act on this pathway and may therefore be a potential therapy.
      Previous examination of existing data for patients with dementia prescribed
      trazodone did not find a signal suggesting a disease modifying effect. Here we
      add to that literature by examining the electronic patient record of patients
      with dementia in Cambridgeshire UK. We found that trazodone is rarely prescribed 
      and where it is used it is at a dose less than half that predicted to be disease 
      modifying. We also found that patients prescribed trazodone had higher levels of 
      neuropsychiatric symptoms and were relatively late in the disease course, likely 
      beyond the optimal point for therapeutic intervention. We suggest it is therefore
      premature to discard potential therapies based on observational data alone,
      particularly when experimental medicine approaches to examine the effects of
      trazodone are feasible.

TI  - Association between late-life weight change and dementia: A population-based
      cohort study.
LID - glac157 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/gerona/glac157 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The impact of late-life weight changes on incident dementia is
      unclear. We aimed to investigate the associations of body mass index (BMI) and
      weight changes with dementia and to explore the role of APOE varepsilon4 in these
      associations. METHODS: A total of 1,673 dementia-free participants aged >/=60
      years were followed for an initial 6 years to detect changes in BMI/weight and
      then for an additional 6 years to detect incident dementia. BMI change ([BMIfirst
      6-year follow-up - BMIbaseline] / BMIbaseline) was categorized as stable (</=5%),
      and moderate (5-10%) or large (>10%) gain or loss. Weight change (weightfirst
      6-year follow-up - weightbaseline) was categorized as stable (</=2.5 kg), and
      moderate (2.5-7.5 kg) or large (>7.5 kg) gain or loss. Dementia was diagnosed
      following standard criteria. Data were analyzed using Cox regression models.
      RESULTS: Over the second 6-year follow-up period, 102 incident dementia cases
      were identified. Compared with stable BMI, the hazard ratios (95% CI) of dementia
      were 2.61 (1.09-5.54) and 2.93 (1.72-4.91) for BMI gain or loss >10%,
      respectively. The risk of dementia was higher among APOE varepsilon4 carriers
      experiencing a large BMI gain (9.93 [3.49-24.6]) or loss (6.66 [2.83-14.4]) than 
      APOE varepsilon4 non-carriers with stable BMI. Similar results were observed for 
      weight change and dementia associations. CONCLUSIONS: BMI and weight changes
      showed U-shaped associations with dementia risk. Large body weight gain and loss 
      alike are associated with an almost 3-fold higher risk of dementia, which may be 
      amplified by APOE varepsilon4.

TI  - Exploring Links Between Psychosis and Frontotemporal Dementia Using Multimodal
      Machine Learning: Dementia Praecox Revisited.
LID - 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2022.2075 [doi]
AB  - Importance: The behavioral and cognitive symptoms of severe psychotic disorders
      overlap with those seen in dementia. However, shared brain alterations remain
      disputed, and their relevance for patients in at-risk disease stages has not been
      explored so far. Objective: To use machine learning to compare the expression of 
      structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) patterns of behavioral-variant
      frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), Alzheimer disease (AD), and schizophrenia;
      estimate predictability in patients with bvFTD and schizophrenia based on
      sociodemographic, clinical, and biological data; and examine prognostic value,
      genetic underpinnings, and progression in patients with clinical high-risk (CHR) 
      states for psychosis or recent-onset depression (ROD). Design, Setting, and
      Participants: This study included 1870 individuals from 5 cohorts, including (1) 
      patients with bvFTD (n = 108), established AD (n = 44), mild cognitive impairment
      or early-stage AD (n = 96), schizophrenia (n = 157), or major depression (n =
      102) to derive and compare diagnostic patterns and (2) patients with CHR (n =
      160) or ROD (n = 161) to test patterns' prognostic relevance and progression.
      Healthy individuals (n = 1042) were used for age-related and cohort-related data 
      calibration. Data were collected from January 1996 to July 2019 and analyzed
      between April 2020 and April 2022. Main Outcomes and Measures: Case assignments
      based on diagnostic patterns; sociodemographic, clinical, and biological data;
      2-year functional outcomes and genetic separability of patients with CHR and ROD 
      with high vs low pattern expression; and pattern progression from baseline to
      follow-up MRI scans in patients with nonrecovery vs preserved recovery. Results: 
      Of 1870 included patients, 902 (48.2%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was
      38.0 (19.3) years. The bvFTD pattern comprising prefrontal, insular, and limbic
      volume reductions was more expressed in patients with schizophrenia (65 of 157
      [41.2%]) and major depression (22 of 102 [21.6%]) than the temporo-limbic AD
      patterns (28 of 157 [17.8%] and 3 of 102 [2.9%], respectively). bvFTD expression 
      was predicted by high body mass index, psychomotor slowing, affective
      disinhibition, and paranoid ideation (R2 = 0.11). The schizophrenia pattern was
      expressed in 92 of 108 patients (85.5%) with bvFTD and was linked to the C9orf72 
      variant, oligoclonal banding in the cerebrospinal fluid, cognitive impairment,
      and younger age (R2 = 0.29). bvFTD and schizophrenia pattern expressions
      forecasted 2-year psychosocial impairments in patients with CHR and were
      predicted by polygenic risk scores for frontotemporal dementia, AD, and
      schizophrenia. Findings were not associated with AD or accelerated brain aging.
      Finally, 1-year bvFTD/schizophrenia pattern progression distinguished patients
      with nonrecovery from those with preserved recovery. Conclusions and Relevance:
      Neurobiological links may exist between bvFTD and psychosis focusing on
      prefrontal and salience system alterations. Further transdiagnostic
      investigations are needed to identify shared pathophysiological processes
      underlying the neuroanatomical interface between the 2 disease spectra.

TI  - Joint Genetic Inhibition of PCSK9 and CETP and the Association With Coronary
      Artery Disease: A Factorial Mendelian Randomization Study.
LID - 10.1001/jamacardio.2022.2333 [doi]
AB  - Importance: Cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibition (CETP) has been shown
      to increase levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and reduce
      levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Current LDL-C target
      attainment is low, and novel phase 3 trials are underway to investigate whether
      CETP inhibitors result in reduction of cardiovascular disease risk in high-risk
      patients who may be treated with PCSK9-inhibiting agents. Objective: To explore
      the associations of combined reduction of CETP and PCSK9 concentrations with risk
      of coronary artery disease (CAD) and other clinical and safety outcomes. Design, 
      Setting, and Participants: Two-sample 2 x 2 factorial Mendelian randomization
      study in a general population sample that includes data for UK Biobank
      participants of European ancestry. Exposures: Separate genetic scores were
      constructed for CETP and PCSK9 plasma protein concentrations, which were combined
      to determine the associations of combined genetically reduced CETP and PCSK9
      concentrations with disease. Main Outcomes and Measures: Blood lipid and
      lipoprotein concentrations, blood pressure, CAD, age-related macular
      degeneration, type 2 diabetes, any stroke and ischemic stroke, Alzheimer disease,
      vascular dementia, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease,
      asthma, and multiple sclerosis. Results: Data for 425354 UKB participants were
      included; the median (IQR) age was 59 years (51-64), and 229399 (53.9%) were
      female. The associations of lower CETP and lower PCSK9 concentrations with CAD
      are similar when scaled per 10-mg/dL reduction in LDL-C concentrations (CETP:
      odds ratio [OR], 0.74; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.81; PCSK9: OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.71 to
      0.79). Combined exposure to lower CETP and PCSK9 concentrations was associated
      with an additive magnitude with lipids and all outcomes, and we did not observe
      any nonadditive interactions, most notably for LDL-C (CETP: effect size, -1.11
      mg/dL; 95% CI, -1.40 to -0.82; PCSK9: effect size, -2.13 mg/dL; 95% CI, -2.43 to 
      -1.84; combined: effect size, -3.47 mg/dL; 95% CI, -3.76 to -3.18; P = .34 for
      interaction) and CAD (CETP: OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.00; PCSK9: OR, 0.94; 95% 
      CI, 0.91 to 0.97; combined: OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.87 to 0.93; P = .83 for
      interaction). In addition, when corrected for multiple testing, lower CETP
      concentrations were associated with increased age-related macular degeneration
      (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.19). Conclusions and Relevance: Our results suggest 
      that joint inhibition of CETP and PCSK9 has additive effects on lipid traits and 
      disease risk, including a lower risk of CAD. Further research may explore whether
      a combination of CETP- and PCSK9-related therapeutics can benefit high-risk
      patients who are unable to reach treatment targets with existing options.

TI  - Adiponectin, the adiponectin paradox, and Alzheimer's Disease: Is this
      association biologically plausible?
LID - 10.1007/s11011-022-01064-8 [doi]
AB  - Dementia, especially Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and vascular dementia, is a major
      public health problem that continues to expand in both economically emerging and 
      hegemonic countries. In 2017, the World Alzheimer Report estimated that over 50
      million people were living with dementia globally. Metabolic dysfunctions of
      brain structures such as the hippocampus and cerebral cortex have been implicated
      as risk factors for dementia. Several well-defined metabolic risk factors for AD 
      include visceral obesity, chronic inflammation, peripheral and brain insulin
      resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypercholesterolemia, and others. In
      this review, we describe the relationship between the dysmetabolic mechanisms,
      although still unknown, and dementia, particularly AD. Adiponectin (ADPN), the
      most abundant circulating adipocytokine, acts as a protagonist in the metabolic
      dysfunction associated with AD, with unexpected and intriguing dual biological
      functions. This contradictory role of ADPN has been termed the adiponectin
      paradox. Some evidence suggests that the adiponectin paradox is important in
      amyloidogenic evolvability in AD. We present cumulative evidence showing that AD 
      and T2DM share many common features. We also review the mechanistic pathways
      involving brain insulin resistance. We discuss the importance of the evolvability
      of amyloidogenic proteins (APs), defined as the capacity of a system for adaptive
      evolution. Finally, we describe potential therapeutic strategies in AD, based on 
      the adiponectin paradox.

TI  - Phosphorylated tau sites that are elevated in Alzheimer's disease fluid
      biomarkers are visualized in early neurofibrillary tangle maturity levels in the 
      post mortem brain.
LID - 10.1002/alz.12749 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers are increasingly more reliable 
      in predicting neuropathology. To facilitate interpretation of phosphorylated tau 
      sites as an early fluid biomarker, we sought to characterize which
      neurofibrillary tangle maturity levels (pretangle, intermediary 1, mature tangle,
      intermediary 2, and ghost tangle) are recognized. METHODS: We queried the Florida
      Autopsied Multi-Ethnic (FLAME) cohort for cases ranging from Braak stages I
      through VI, excluding non-AD neuropathologies and tauopathies. Thioflavin-S
      staining was compared to immunohistochemical measures of phosphorylated threonine
      (pT) 181, pT205, pT217, and pT231 in two hippocampal subsectors across n = 24
      cases. RESULTS: Each phosphorylated tau site immunohistochemically labeled early 
      neurofibrillary tangle maturity levels compared to advanced levels recognized by 
      thioflavin-S. Hippocampal burden generally increased with each Braak stage.
      DISCUSSION: These results provide neurobiologic evidence that these
      phosphorylated tau fluid biomarker sites are present during early neurofibrillary
      tangle maturity levels and may explain why these fluid biomarker measures are
      observed before symptom onset. HIGHLIGHTS: Immunohistochemical evaluation of four
      phosphorylated tau fluid biomarker sites. Earlier neurofibrillary tangle maturity
      levels recognized by phosphorylated tau in proline-rich region. Advanced tangle
      pathology is elevated in the subiculum compared to the cornu ammonis 1 of the
      hippocampus. Novel semi-quantitative frequency to calculate tangle maturity
      frequency.

TI  - Cognitive resilience depends on white matter connectivity: The Maastricht Study.
LID - 10.1002/alz.12758 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Differences in brain network connectivity may reflect the
      capability of the neurological substrate to compensate for brain damage and
      preserve cognitive function (cognitive reserve). We examined the associations
      between white matter connectivity, brain damage markers, and cognition in a
      population sample of middle-aged individuals. METHODS: A total of 4759
      participants from The Maastricht Study (mean age = 59.2, SD = 8.7, 50.2% male)
      underwent cognitive testing and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI), from
      which brain volume, structural connectivity, and vascular damage were quantified.
      Multivariable linear regression was used to investigate whether connectivity
      modified the association between brain damage and cognition, adjusted for
      demographic and cardiometabolic risk factors. RESULTS: More atrophic and vascular
      brain damage was associated with worse cognition scores. Increasing connectivity 
      moderated the negative association between damage and cognition (chi(2) = 8.64,
      df = 3, p </= 0.001); individuals with high damage but strong connectivity showed
      normal cognition. DISCUSSION: Findings support the reserve hypothesis by showing 
      that brain connectivity is associated with cognitive resilience.

LID - 10.4155/fmc-2022-0061 [doi]
AB  - Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) drugs in therapy are limited to
      acetylcholine esterase inhibitors and memantine. Newly developed drugs against a 
      single target structure have an insufficient effect on symptomatic AD patients.
      Results: Novel aromatically anellated pyridofuranes have been evaluated for
      inhibition of AD-relevant protein kinases cdk1, cdk2, gsk-3b and Fyn. Best
      activities have been found for naphthopyridofuranes with a hydroxyl function as
      part of the 5-substituent and a hydrogen or halogen substituent in the
      8-position. Best results in nanomolar ranges were found for benzopyridofuranes
      with a 6-hydroxy and a 3-alkoxy substitution or an exclusive 6-alkoxy
      substituent. Conclusion: First lead compounds were identified inhibiting two to
      three kinases in nanomolar ranges to be qualified as an innovative approach for
      AD multitargeting.

LID - 10.1111/cbdd.14129 [doi]
AB  - Quinazoline heterocycles are critical in the development of medications.
      Quinazoline derivatives have been intensively researched, providing a wide range 
      of compounds with diverse biological roles. The quinazoline nucleus has garnered 
      a lot of attention in medical chemistry in recent years. It was assumed to be a
      pharmacophore component in the development of physiologically interesting drugs. 
      This review is an attempt to increase the potential of quinazoline by
      highlighting a wide range of advancements demonstrated by numerous derivatives of
      the quinazoline moiety, as well as focusing on diverse pharmacological actions of
      the quinazoline moiety. This review compiles recent studies on the quinazoline
      moiety described in the literature by researchers.

TI  - Sleep duration, genetic susceptibility, and Alzheimer's disease: a longitudinal
      UK Biobank-based study.
PG  - 638
LID - 10.1186/s12877-022-03298-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequently occurring type of
      dementia. Concurrently, inadequate sleep has been recognized as a public health
      epidemic. Notably, genetic and environmental factors are now considered
      contributors to AD progression. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between
      sleep duration, genetic susceptibility, and AD. METHODS AND RESULTS: Based on
      483,507 participants from the UK Biobank (UKB) with an average follow-up of 11.3 
      years, there was a non-linear relationship between AD incidence and sleep
      duration (P for non-linear < 0.001) by restricted cubic splines (RCS). Sleep
      duration was categorized into short sleep duration (< 6 h/night), normal sleep
      duration (6-9 h/night), and long sleep duration (> 9 h/night). No statistically
      significant interaction was identified between sleep duration and the AD-GRS
      (Alzheimer's disease genetic risk score, P for interaction = 0.45) using Cox
      proportional risk model. Compared with the participants who had a low AD-GRS and 
      normal sleep duration, there was associated with a higher risk of AD in
      participants with a low AD-GRS and long sleep duration (HR = 3.4806; 95% CI
      2.0011-6.054, p < 0.001), participants with an intermediate AD-GRS and long sleep
      duration (HR = 2.0485; 95% CI 1.3491-3.1105, p < 0.001), participants with a high
      AD-GRS and normal sleep duration (HR = 1.9272; 95% CI 1.5361-2.4176, p < 0.001), 
      and participants with a high AD-GRS and long sleep duration (HR = 5.4548; 95% CI 
      3.1367-9.4863, p < 0.001).In addition, there was no causal association between AD
      and sleep duration using Two Sample Mendelian randomization (MR). CONCLUSION: In 
      the UKB population, though there was no causal association between AD and sleep
      duration analyzed using Two Sample MR, long sleep duration (> 9 h/night) was
      significantly associated with a higher risk of AD, regardless of high,
      intermediate or low AD-GRS. Prolonged sleep duration may be one of the clinical
      predictors of a higher risk of AD.

TI  - Is dietary choline intake related to dementia and Alzheimer's disease risk:
      results from the Framingham Heart Study.
LID - nqac193 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/ajcn/nqac193 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The positive association of choline for cognition has been reported
      in both animal and human studies, yet the association of choline with the risk of
      incident dementia or Alzheimer's disease (AD) in humans is unclear. OBJECTIVES:
      Our objective was to test the hypothesis that lower (higher) dietary choline
      intake is associated with increased (decreased) risk of incident dementia or AD. 
      DESIGN: Data from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) Offspring Cohort Exam 5 to
      Exam 9 were used. Participants were free of dementia and stroke with valid
      self-report 126-item Harvard food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) at Exam 5. The
      intakes of total choline, its contributing compounds, and betaine were estimated 
      based on a published nutrient database. The intakes were updated at each exam to 
      represent the cumulative average intake across the five exams. The associations
      between dietary choline intake and incident dementia and AD were examined in the 
      mixed effect Cox proportional hazard models, adjusting for covariates. RESULTS: A
      total of 3,224 participants (53.8% female, mean +/- SD age 54.5 +/- 9.7 year)
      were followed up for a mean +/- SD of 16.1 +/- 5.1 years (1991-2011). There were 
      247 incident dementia cases, of which 177 were AD. Dietary choline intake showed 
      non-linear relationship with incident dementia and AD. After adjusting for
      covariates, low choline intake (defined as choline/100 </= 2.19 and choline/100
      </= 2.15 in our sample) was significantly associated with incident dementia or
      incident AD. CONCLUSION: Low choline intake was associated with increased risk of
      incident dementia or AD.

TI  - Pre-pandemic Alzheimer Disease Biomarkers and Anxious-Depressive Symptoms During 
      the COVID-19 Confinement in Cognitively Unimpaired Adults.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Increased anxious-depressive symptomatology is
      observed in the preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which may
      accelerate disease progression. We investigated whether amyloid-beta, cortical
      thickness in medial temporal lobe structures , neuroinflammation and
      sociodemographic factors were associated with greater anxious-depressive symptoms
      during the COVID-19 confinement. METHODS: This retrospective observational study 
      included cognitively unimpaired older adults from the ALFA (Alzheimer and
      FAmilies) cohort, the majority with a family history of sporadic AD. Participants
      performed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) during the COVID-19
      confinement. A subset had available retrospective (on average: 2.4 years before) 
      HADS assessment, amyloid [(18)F] flutemetamol PET and structural MRI scans and
      CSF markers of neuroinflammation (interleukin-6 [IL-6], triggering receptor
      expressed on myeloid cells 2 and glial fibrillary acidic protein levels). We
      performed multivariable linear regression models to investigate the associations 
      of pre-pandemic AD-related biomarkers and sociodemographic factors with HADS
      scores during the confinement. We further performed an analysis of covariance in 
      order to adjust by participants' pre-pandemic anxiety-depression levels .
      Finally, we explored the role of stress and lifestyle changes (sleep patterns,
      eating, drinking, smoking habits, and medication use) on the tested associations 
      and performed sex-stratified analyses. RESULTS: We included 921 (254 with AD
      biomarkers) participants. Amyloid-beta positivity (B=3.73; 95%CI=1.1 to 6.36;
      p=.006), caregiving (B=1.37; 95%CI=0.24 to 2.5; p=.018), sex (women: B=1.95;
      95%CI=1.1 to 2.79; p<.001), younger age (B=-0.12; 95%CI=-0.18 to -0.052; p<.001) 
      and lower education (B=-0.16; 95%CI=-0.28 to -0.042; p=.008) were associated with
      greater anxious-depressive symptoms during the confinement. Considering
      pre-pandemic anxiety-depression levels, we further observed an association
      between lower levels of CSF IL-6 (B=-5.11; 95%CI=-10.1 to -0.13; p=.044) and
      greater HADS scores. The results were independent of stress-related variables and
      lifestyle changes. Stratified analysis revealed that the associations were mainly
      driven by women. DISCUSSION: Our results link AD-related pathophysiology and
      neuroinflammation with greater anxious-depressive symptomatology during the
      COVID-19-related confinement, notably in women. AD pathophysiology may increase
      neuropsychiatric symptomatology in response to stressors. This association may
      imply a worse clinical prognosis in people at risk for AD after the pandemic, and
      thus deserves to be considered by clinicians. TRIAL REGISTRATION INFORMATION:

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Several pathological processes might contribute to the degeneration
      of the cholinergic system in aging. We aimed to determine the contribution of
      amyloid, tau, and cerebrovascular biomarkers towards the degeneration of
      cholinergic white matter (WM) projections in cognitively unimpaired individuals. 
      METHODS: The contribution of amyloid and tau pathology was assessed through
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of the Abeta42/40 ratio and phosphorylated tau
      (p-tau). CSF Abeta38 levels were also measured. Cerebrovascular pathology was
      assessed using automatic segmentations of WM lesions on magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI). Cholinergic WM projections (i.e., cingulum and external capsule
      pathways) were modeled using tractography based on diffusion tensor imaging data.
      Sex and APOE 4 carriership were also included in the analysis as variables of
      interest. RESULTS: We included 203 cognitively unimpaired individuals from the
      H70 Gothenburg Birth Cohort Studies (all individuals 70 years old, 51% female).
      WM lesion burden was the most important contributor to the degeneration of both
      cholinergic pathways (Increase in mean square error (IncMSE)=98.8% in external
      capsule pathway and IncMSE=93.3% in the cingulum pathway). Levels of Abeta38 and 
      p-tau also contributed to cholinergic white matter degeneration, especially in
      the external capsule pathway (IncMSE=28.4% and IncMSE=23.4%, respectively). The
      Abeta42/40 ratio did not contribute notably to the models (IncMSE<3.0%). APOE 4
      carriers showed poorer integrity in the cingulum pathway (IncMSE=21.33%). Women
      showed poorer integrity of the external capsule pathway (IncMSE=21.55%), which
      was independent of amyloid status as reflected by the non-significant differences
      in integrity when comparing amyloid positive versus amyloid negative women
      participants (T201=-1.55; p=0.123). CONCLUSIONS: In cognitively unimpaired older 
      individuals, WM lesions play a central role in the degeneration of cholinergic
      pathways. Our findings highlight the importance of WM lesion burden in the
      elderly population, which should be considered in the development of prevention
      programs for neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment.

TI  - beta-amyloid PET harmonisation across longitudinal studies: Application to AIBL,

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The Centiloid scale was developed to harmonise the quantification
      of beta-amyloid (Abeta) PET images across tracers, scanners, and processing
      pipelines. However, several groups have reported differences across tracers and
      scanners even after centiloid conversion. In this study, we aim to evaluate the
      impact of different pre and post-processing harmonisation steps on the robustness
      of longitudinal Centiloid data across three large international cohort studies.
      METHODS: All Abeta PET data in AIBL (N=3315), ADNI (N=3442) and OASIS3 (N=1398)
      were quantified using the MRI-based Centiloid standard SPM pipeline and the
      PET-only pipeline CapAIBL. SUVR were converted into Centiloids using each
      tracer's respective transform. Global Abeta burden from pre-defined target
      cortical regions in Centiloid units were quantified for both raw PET scans and
      PET scans smoothed to a uniform 8mm full width half maximum (FWHM) effective
      smoothness. For Florbetapir, we assessed the performance of using both the
      standard Whole Cerebellum (WCb) and a composite white matter (WM)+WCb reference
      region. Additionally, our recently proposed quantification based on Non-negative 
      Matrix Factorisation (NMF) was applied to all spatially and SUVR normalised
      images. Correlation with clinical severity measured by the Mini-Mental State
      Examination (MMSE) and effect size, as well as tracer agreement in
      (11)C-PiB-(18)F-Florbetapir pairs and longitudinal consistency were evaluated.
      RESULTS: The smoothing to a uniform resolution partially reduced longitudinal
      variability, but did not improve inter-tracer agreement, effect size or
      correlation with MMSE. Using a Composite reference region for (18)F-Florbetapir
      improved inter-tracer agreement, effect size, correlation with MMSE, and
      longitudinal consistency. The best results were however obtained when using the
      NMF method which outperformed all other quantification approaches in all metrics 
      used. CONCLUSIONS: FWHM smoothing has limited impact on longitudinal consistency 
      or outliers. A Composite reference region including subcortical WM should be used
      for computing both cross-sectional and longitudinal Florbetapir Centiloid. NMF
      improves Centiloid quantification on all metrics examined.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neurodegenerative diseases are chronic, currently incurable, diseases
      of the elderly, which are characterized by protein misfolding and neuronal
      damage. Fucoxanthin, derived from marine brown algae, presents a promising
      candidate for the development of effective therapeutic strategies. HYPOTHESIS AND
      PURPOSE: The relationship between neurodegenerative disease management and
      fucoxanthin has not yet been clarified. This study focuses on the fundamental
      mechanisms and targets of fucoxanthin in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease
      management, showing that communication between the brain and the gut contributes 
      to neurodegenerative diseases and early diagnosis of ophthalmic diseases. This
      paper also presents, new insights for future therapeutic directions based on the 
      integrated application of artificial intelligence. CONCLUSION: Fucoxanthin
      primarily binds to amyloid fibrils with spreading properties such as Abeta, tau, 
      and alpha-synuclein to reduce their accumulation levels, alleviate inflammatory
      factors, and restore mitochondrial membranes to prevent oxidative stress via Nrf2
      and Akt signaling pathways, involving reduction of specific secretases. In
      addition, fucoxanthin may serve as a preventive diagnosis for neurodegenerative
      diseases through ophthalmic disorders. It can modulate gut microbes and has
      potential for the alleviation and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

TI  - Self-reported sleepiness associates with greater brain and cortical volume and
      lower prevalence of ischemic covert brain infarcts in a community sample.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: We evaluated if self-reported sleepiness was associated with
      neuroimaging markers of brain aging and ischemic damage in a large
      community-based sample. METHODS: Participants from the Framingham Heart Study
      Offspring cohort (n=468, 62.5+/-8.7, 49.6%M) free of dementia, stroke, and
      neurological diseases, completed sleep questionnaires and polysomnography
      followed by MRI, three years later on average. We used linear and logistic
      regression models to evaluate the associations between Epworth Sleepiness Scale
      scores and total brain, cortical and subcortical gray matter, and white matter
      hyperintensities volumes, and the presence of covert brain infarcts. RESULTS:
      Higher sleepiness scores were associated with larger total brain, greater
      cortical gray matter volume, and a lower prevalence of covert brain infarcts,
      even when adjusting for a large array of potential confounders, including
      demographics, sleep profiles and disorders, organic health diseases, and proxies 
      for daytime cognitive and physical activities. Interactions indicated that more
      sleepiness associated with larger cortical gray matter volume in men only and in 
      APOE epsilon4 non-carriers, whereas a trend for smaller cortical gray matter
      volume was observed in carriers. In longitudinal analyses, those with stable
      excessive daytime sleepiness over time had greater cortical total brain and
      cortical gray matter volumes, whereas baseline sleepiness scores were not
      associated with subsequent atrophy or cognitive decline. CONCLUSION: Our findings
      suggest that sleepiness is not necessarily a marker of poor brain health when not
      explained by diseases or sleep debt and disorders. Rather, sleepiness could be a 
      marker of preserved sleep-regulatory processes and brain health in some cases.

TI  - Synthetic PPAR Agonist DTMB Alleviates Alzheimer's Disease Pathology by
      Inhibition of Chronic Microglial Inflammation in 5xFAD Mice.
LID - 10.1007/s13311-022-01275-y [doi]
AB  - Abnormal productions of amyloid beta (Abeta) plaque and chronic neuroinflammation
      are commonly observed in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease, and both
      of which induce neuronal cell death, loss of memory, and cognitive dysfunction.
      However, many of the drugs targeting the production of Abeta peptides have been
      unsuccessful in treating Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we identified
      synthetic novel peroxisome proliferator-activating receptor (PPAR) agonist, DTMB,
      which can ameliorate the chronic inflammation and Abeta pathological progression 
      of Alzheimer's disease. We discovered that DTMB attenuated the proinflammatory
      cytokine production of microglia by reducing the protein level of NF-kappaB. DTMB
      also improved the learning and memory defects and reduced the amount of Abeta
      plaque in the brain of 5xFAD mice. This reduction in Abeta pathology was
      attributed to the changes in gliosis and chronic inflammation level.
      Additionally, bulk RNA-sequencing showed that genes related to inflammation and
      cognitive function were changed in the hippocampus and cortex of DTMB-treated
      mice. Our findings demonstrate that DTMB has the potential to be a novel
      therapeutic agent for Alzheimer's disease.

TI  - Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation of the Brain After Ischemic Stroke: 
      Mechanisms from Animal Models.
LID - 10.1007/s10571-022-01264-x [doi]
AB  - Stroke is a common cerebrovascular disease with high morbidity, mortality, and
      disability worldwide. Post-stroke dysfunction is related to the death of neurons 
      and impairment of synaptic structure, which results from cerebral ischemic
      damage. Currently, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) techniques are
      available to provide clinically effective interventions and quantitative
      diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. The development of TMS has been 40 years
      and a range of repetitive TMS (rTMS) protocols are now available to regulate
      neuronal plasticity in many neurological disorders, such as stroke, Parkinson
      disease, psychiatric disorders, Alzheimer disease, and so on. Basic studies in an
      animal model with ischemic stroke are significant for demonstrating potential
      mechanisms of neural restoration induced by rTMS. In this review, the mechanisms 
      were summarized, involving synaptic plasticity, neural cell death, neurogenesis, 
      immune response, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption in vitro and vivo
      experiments with ischemic stroke models. Those findings can contribute to the
      understanding of how rTMS modulated function recovery and the exploration of
      novel therapeutic targets. The mechanisms of rTMS in treating ischemic stroke
      from animal models. rTMS can prompt synaptic plasticity by increasing NMDAR,
      AMPAR and BDNF expression; rTMS can inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF and
      facilitate the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 by shifting
      astrocytic phenotypes from A1 to A2, and shifting microglial phenotypes from M1
      to M2; rTMS facilitated the release of angiogenesis-related factors TGFbeta and
      VEGF in A2 astrocytes, which can contribute to vasculogenesis and angiogenesis;
      rTMS can suppress apoptosis by increasing Bcl-2 expression and inhibiting Bax,
      caspase-3 expression; rTMS can also suppress pyroptosis by decreasing caspase-1, 
      IL-1beta, ASC, GSDMD and NLRP1 expression. rTMS, repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation; NMDAR, N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors; AMPAR:

TI  - Assessing mild cognitive impairment using object-location memory in immersive
      virtual environments.
LID - 10.1002/hipo.23458 [doi]
AB  - Pathological changes in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) are found in the early
      stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and aging. The earliest pathological
      accumulation of tau colocalizes with the areas of the MTL involved in object
      processing as part of a wider anterolateral network. Here, we sought to assess
      the diagnostic potential of memory for object locations in iVR environments in
      individuals at high risk of AD dementia (amnestic mild cognitive impairment
      [aMCI] n = 23) as compared to age-related cognitive decline. Consistent with our 
      primary hypothesis that early AD would be associated with impaired object
      location, aMCI patients exhibited impaired spatial feature binding. Compared to
      both older (n = 24) and younger (n = 53) controls, aMCI patients, recalled object
      locations with significantly less accuracy (p < .001), with a trend toward an
      impaired identification of the object's correct context (p = .05). Importantly,
      these findings were not explained by deficits in object recognition (p = .6).
      These deficits differentiated aMCI from controls with greater accuracy (AUC =
      0.89) than the standard neuropsychological tests. Within the aMCI group, 16 had
      CSF biomarkers indicative of their likely AD status (MCI+ n = 9 vs. MCI- n = 7). 
      MCI+ showed lower accuracy in the object-context association than MCI- (p = .03) 
      suggesting a selective deficit in object-context binding postulated to be
      associated with anterior-temporal areas. MRI volumetric analysis across healthy
      older participants and aMCI revealed that test performance positively correlates 
      with lateral entorhinal cortex volumes (p < .05) and hippocampus volumes (p <
      .01), consistent with their hypothesized role in binding contextual and spatial
      information with object identity. Our results indicate that tests relying on the 
      anterolateral object processing stream, and in particular requiring successful
      binding of an object with spatial information, may aid detection of pre-dementia 
      AD due to the underlying early spread of tau pathology.

TI  - Hypolipogenic effects of Icariside E4 via phosphorylation of AMPK and inhibition 
      of MID1IP1 in HepG2 cells.
LID - 10.1002/ptr.7584 [doi]
AB  - Though icariside E4 (IE4) is known to have anti-noceptive, anti-oxidant,
      anti-Alzheimer and anti-inflammatory effects, there was no evidence on the effect
      of IE4 on lipid metabolism so far. Hence, the hypolipogenic mechanism of IE4 was 
      investigated in HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HCCs) in association with
      MID1 Interacting Protein 1(MID1IP1) and AMPK signaling. Here, IE4 did not show
      any toxicity in HepG2 cells, but reduced lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells by Oil
      Red O staining. MID1IP1 depletion decreased the expression of SREBP-1c and fatty 
      acid synthase (FASN) and induced phosphorylation of ACC in HepG2 cells. Indeed,
      IE4 activated phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC and inhibited the expression of
      MID1IP1 in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, IE4 suppressed the expression of SREBP-1c,
      liver X receptor-alpha (LXR), and FASN for de novo lipogenesis in HepG2 cells.
      Interestingly, AMPK inhibitor compound C reversed the ability of IE4 to reduce
      MID1IP1, SREBP-1c, and FASN and activate phosphorylation of AMPK/ACC in HepG2
      cells, indicating the important role of AMPK/ACC signaling in IE4-induced
      hypolipogenic effect. Taken together, these findings suggest that IE4 has
      hypolipogenic potential in HepG2 cells via activation of AMPK and inhibition of
      MID1IP1 as a potent candidate for treatment of fatty liver disease.

TI  - Noradrenergic Add-on Therapy with Extended-Release Guanfacine in Alzheimer's
      Disease (NorAD): study protocol for a randomised clinical trial and COVID-19
      amendments.
PG  - 623
LID - 10.1186/s13063-022-06190-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Guanfacine is a alpha2A adrenergic receptor agonist approved for
      treating attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is thought to act
      via postsynaptic receptors in the prefrontal cortex, modulating executive
      functions including the regulation of attention. Attention is affected early in
      Alzheimer's disease (AD), and this may relate to pathological changes within the 
      locus coeruleus, the main source of noradrenergic pathways within the brain.
      Given that cholinergic pathways, also involved in attention, are disrupted in AD,
      the combination of noradrenergic and cholinergic treatments may have a
      synergistic effect on symptomatic AD. The primary objective of the NorAD trial is
      to evaluate the change in cognition with 12 weeks of treatment of
      extended-release guanfacine (GXR) against a placebo as a combination therapy with
      cholinesterase inhibitors in participants with mild to moderate Alzheimer's
      disease. METHODS/DESIGN: NorAD is a 3-month, single-centre, randomised,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III trial of extended-release guanfacine 
      (GXR) in participants with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. A total of 160
      participants will be randomised to receive either daily guanfacine or placebo in 
      combination with approved cholinesterase treatment for 12 weeks. The primary
      outcome is the change in cognition, as measured by the Alzheimer's Disease
      Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog), from baseline to follow-up in the
      treatment group compared to the placebo group. Secondary outcomes include the
      change in additional cognitive measures of attention (Tests of Attention: Trails 
      A and B, digit-symbol substitution, Test of Everyday Attention and CANTAB-RVP),
      neuropsychiatric symptoms (Neuropsychiatric Inventory), caregiver burden (Zarit
      Burden Interview) and activities of daily living (Alzheimer's Disease
      Co-operative Study - Activities of Daily Living Inventory). From July 2020,
      observation of change following cessation of treatment is also being assessed.
      DISCUSSION: There is strong evidence for early noradrenergic dysfunction in
      Alzheimer's disease. The NorAD trial aims to determine whether guanfacine, a
      noradrenergic alpha-2 agonist, improves attention and cognition when used in
      addition to standard cholinergic treatment. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder and 
      the most common type of dementia. AD is characterized by a decline of cognitive
      function and brain atrophy, and is highly heritable with estimated heritability
      ranging from 60 to 80[Formula: see text]. The most straightforward and widely
      used strategy to identify AD genetic basis is to perform genome-wide association 
      study (GWAS) of the case-control diagnostic status. These GWAS studies have
      identified over 50 AD related susceptibility loci. Recently, imaging genetics has
      emerged as a new field where brain imaging measures are studied as quantitative
      traits to detect genetic factors. Given that many imaging genetics studies did
      not involve the diagnostic outcome in the analysis, the identified imaging or
      genetic markers may not be related or specific to the disease outcome. RESULTS:
      We propose a novel method to identify disease-related genetic variants enriched
      by imaging endophenotypes, which are the imaging traits associated with both
      genetic factors and disease status. Our analysis consists of three steps: (1) map
      the effects of a genetic variant (e.g., single nucleotide polymorphism or SNP)
      onto imaging traits across the brain using a linear regression model, (2) map the
      effects of a diagnosis phenotype onto imaging traits across the brain using a
      linear regression model, and (3) detect SNP-diagnosis association via correlating
      the SNP effects with the diagnostic effects on the brain-wide imaging traits. We 
      demonstrate the promise of our approach by applying it to the Alzheimer's Disease
      Neuroimaging Initiative database. Among 54 AD related susceptibility loci
      reported in prior large-scale AD GWAS, our approach identifies 41 of those from a
      much smaller study cohort while the standard association approaches identify only
      two of those. Clearly, the proposed imaging endophenotype enriched approach can
      reveal promising AD genetic variants undetectable using the traditional method.
      CONCLUSION: We have proposed a novel method to identify AD genetic variants
      enriched by brain-wide imaging endophenotypes. This approach can not only boost
      detection power, but also reveal interesting biological pathways from genetic
      determinants to intermediate brain traits and to phenotypic AD outcomes.

AB  - Primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) is an autoimmune disease with frequent
      neurological involvement. Memory complaints are common, but their precise
      patterns remain unclear. We wanted to characterize patterns of neurocognitive
      profiles in pSS patients with cognitive complaints. Only pSS patients with memory
      complaints were included, prospectively. Cognitive profiles were compiled through
      a comprehensive cognitive evaluation by neuropsychologists. Evaluations of
      anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disorders and quality of life were performed 
      for testing their interactions with cognitive profiles. All 32 pSS patients
      showed at least borderline cognitive impairment, and 17 (53%) exhibited a
      pathological cognitive profile: a hippocampal profile (37%), a dysexecutive
      profile (22%), and an instrumental profile (16%) (possible overlap). Regarding
      the secondary objectives: 37% of patients were depressed, and 48% exhibited a
      mild-to-severe anxiety trait. Sleep disorders were frequent (excessive daytime
      sleepiness (55%), high risk for sleep apnea (45%), and insomnia (77%)). Cognitive
      impairments could not be explained alone by anxiety, depression or sleep
      disorders. Fatigue level was strongly associated with sleep disorders. Our study 
      highlights that cognitive complaints in pSS patients are supported by measurable 
      cognitive impairments, apart from frequently associated disorders such as
      depression, anxiety or sleep troubles. Sleep disorders should be screened.

      compromising cerebrovascular function.
PG  - 1020-1033
LID - 10.1038/s41593-022-01127-0 [doi]
AB  - The epsilon4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene, a genetic risk factor
      for Alzheimer's disease, is abundantly expressed in both the brain and periphery.
      Here, we present evidence that peripheral apoE isoforms, separated from those in 
      the brain by the blood-brain barrier, differentially impact Alzheimer's disease
      pathogenesis and cognition. To evaluate the function of peripheral apoE, we
      developed conditional mouse models expressing human APOE3 or APOE4 in the liver
      with no detectable apoE in the brain. Liver-expressed apoE4 compromised synaptic 
      plasticity and cognition by impairing cerebrovascular functions. Plasma proteome 
      profiling revealed apoE isoform-dependent functional pathways highlighting cell
      adhesion, lipoprotein metabolism and complement activation. ApoE3 plasma from
      young mice improved cognition and reduced vessel-associated gliosis when
      transfused into aged mice, whereas apoE4 compromised the beneficial effects of
      young plasma. A human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived endothelial cell
      model recapitulated the plasma apoE isoform-specific effect on endothelial
      integrity, further supporting a vascular-related mechanism. Upon breeding with
      amyloid model mice, liver-expressed apoE4 exacerbated brain amyloid pathology,
      whereas apoE3 reduced it. Our findings demonstrate pathogenic effects of
      peripheral apoE4, providing a strong rationale for targeting peripheral apoE to
      treat Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - During the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in both mouse models and
      human patients, soluble forms of Amyloid-beta 1-42 oligomers (Abeta42o) trigger
      loss of excitatory synapses (synaptotoxicity) in cortical and hippocampal
      pyramidal neurons (PNs) prior to the formation of insoluble amyloid plaques. In a
      transgenic AD mouse model, we observed a spatially restricted structural
      remodeling of mitochondria in the apical tufts of CA1 PNs dendrites corresponding
      to the dendritic domain where the earliest synaptic loss is detected in vivo. We 
      also observed AMPK over-activation as well as increased fragmentation and loss of
      mitochondrial biomass in Ngn2-induced neurons derived from a new APP(Swe/Swe)
      knockin human ES cell line. We demonstrate that Abeta42o-dependent
      over-activation of the CAMKK2-AMPK kinase dyad mediates synaptic loss through
      coordinated phosphorylation of MFF-dependent mitochondrial fission and
      ULK2-dependent mitophagy. Our results uncover a unifying stress-response pathway 
      causally linking Abeta42o-dependent structural remodeling of dendritic
      mitochondria to synaptic loss.

TI  - Chr21 protein-protein interactions: enrichment in proteins involved in
      intellectual disability, autism, and late-onset Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Down syndrome (DS) is caused by human chromosome 21 (HSA21) trisomy. It is
      characterized by a poorly understood intellectual disability (ID). We studied two
      mouse models of DS, one with an extra copy of the Dyrk1A gene (189N3) and the
      other with an extra copy of the mouse Chr16 syntenic region (Dp(16)1Yey). RNA-seq
      analysis of the transcripts deregulated in the embryonic hippocampus revealed an 
      enrichment in genes associated with chromatin for the 189N3 model, and synapses
      for the Dp(16)1Yey model. A large-scale yeast two-hybrid screen (82 different
      screens, including 72 HSA21 baits and 10 rebounds) of a human brain library
      containing at least 10(7) independent fragments identified 1,949 novel
      protein-protein interactions. The direct interactors of HSA21 baits and rebounds 
      were significantly enriched in ID-related genes (P-value < 2.29 x 10(-8)).
      Proximity ligation assays showed that some of the proteins encoded by HSA21 were 
      located at the dendritic spine postsynaptic density, in a protein network at the 
      dendritic spine postsynapse. We located HSA21 DYRK1A and DSCAM, mutations of
      which increase the risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) 20-fold, in this
      postsynaptic network. We found that an intracellular domain of DSCAM bound either
      DLGs, which are multimeric scaffolds comprising receptors, ion channels and
      associated signaling proteins, or DYRK1A. The DYRK1A-DSCAM interaction domain is 
      conserved in Drosophila and humans. The postsynaptic network was found to be
      enriched in proteins associated with ARC-related synaptic plasticity, ASD, and
      late-onset Alzheimer's disease. These results highlight links between DS and
      brain diseases with a complex genetic basis.

AB  - Prior studies of aging and Alzheimer disease have evaluated resting state
      functional connectivity (FC) using either seed-based correlation (SBC) or
      independent component analysis (ICA), with a focus on particular functional
      systems. SBC and ICA both are insensitive to differences in signal amplitude. At 
      the same time, accumulating evidence indicates that the amplitude of spontaneous 
      BOLD signal fluctuations is physiologically meaningful. We systematically
      compared covariance-based FC, which is sensitive to amplitude, vs.
      correlation-based FC, which is not, in affected individuals and controls drawn
      from two cohorts of participants including autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease
      (ADAD), late onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD), and age-matched controls. Functional
      connectivity was computed over 222 regions of interest and group differences were
      evaluated in terms of components projected onto a space of lower dimension. Our
      principal observations are: (1) Aging is associated with global loss of resting
      state fMRI signal amplitude that is approximately uniform across resting state
      networks. (2) Thus, covariance FC measures decrease with age whereas correlation 
      FC is relatively preserved in healthy aging. (3) In contrast, symptomatic ADAD
      and LOAD both lead to loss of spontaneous activity amplitude as well as severely 
      degraded correlation structure. These results demonstrate a double dissociation
      between age vs. Alzheimer disease and the amplitude vs. correlation structure of 
      resting state BOLD signals. Modeling results suggest that the AD-associated loss 
      of correlation structure is attributable to a relative increase in the fraction
      of locally restricted as opposed to widely shared variance.

AB  - One potential therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer disease (AD) is to promote
      degradation of amyloid beta (Abeta) and we previously demonstrated that the
      lysosomal protease tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) can degrade Abeta fibrils in
      vitro. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that increasing levels of TPP1
      might promote degradation of Abeta under physiological conditions, slowing or
      preventing its accumulation in the brain with subsequent therapeutic benefits. We
      used 2 approaches to increase TPP1 activity in the brain of J20 mice, an AD model
      that accumulates Abeta and exhibits cognitive defects: transgenic overexpression 
      of TPP1 in the brain and a pharmacological approach employing administration of
      recombinant TPP1. While we clearly observed the expected AD phenotype of the J20 
      mice based on pathology and measurement of behavioral and cognitive defects, we
      found that elevation of TPP1 activity by either experimental approach failed to
      have any measurable beneficial effect on disease phenotype.

AB  - Mental health disorders, particularly depression and anxiety, affect a
      significant number of the global population. Several pathophysiological pathways 
      for these disorders have been identified, including the
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, autonomic nervous system, and the immune
      system. In addition, life events, environmental factors, and lifestyle affect the
      onset, progression, and recurrence of mental health disorders. These may all
      overlap with periodontal and/or peri-implant disease. Mental health disorders are
      associated with more severe periodontal disease and, in some cases, poorer
      healing outcomes to nonsurgical periodontal therapy. They can result in behavior 
      modification, such as poor oral hygiene practices, tobacco smoking, and alcohol
      abuse, which are also risk factors for periodontal disease and, therefore, may
      have a contributory effect. Stress has immunomodulatory effects regulating immune
      cell numbers and function, as well as proinflammatory cytokine production. Stress
      markers such as cortisol and catecholamines may modulate periodontal bacterial
      growth and the expression of virulence factors. Stress and some mental health
      disorders are accompanied by a low-grade chronic inflammation that may be
      involved in their relationship with periodontal disease and vice versa. Although 
      the gut microbiome interacting with the central nervous system (gut-brain axis)
      is thought to play a significant role in mental illness, less is understood about
      the role of the oral microbiome. The evidence for mental health disorders on
      implant outcomes is lacking, but may mainly be through behaviourial changes.
      Through lack of compliance withoral hygiene and maintenance visits, peri-implant 
      health can be affected. Increased smoking and risk of periodontal disease may
      also affect implant outcomes. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been
      linked with higher implant failure. They have an anabolic effect on bone,
      reducing turnover, which could account for the increased loss.

TI  - The Link between Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Neurocognitive Impairment: An
      Official American Thoracic Society Workshop Report.
PG  - 1245-1256
LID - 10.1513/AnnalsATS.202205-380ST [doi]
AB  - There is emerging evidence that obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a risk factor
      for preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). An American Thoracic Society workshop
      was convened that included clinicians, basic scientists, and epidemiologists with
      expertise in OSA, cognition, and dementia, with the overall objectives of
      summarizing the state of knowledge in the field, identifying important research
      gaps, and identifying potential directions for future research. Although
      currently available cognitive screening tests may allow for identification of
      cognitive impairment in patients with OSA, they should be interpreted with
      caution. Neuroimaging in OSA can provide surrogate measures of disease
      chronicity, but it has methodological limitations. Most data on the impact of OSA
      treatment on cognition are for continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), with
      limited data for other treatments. The cognitive domains improving with CPAP show
      considerable heterogeneity across studies. OSA can negatively influence risk,
      manifestations, and possibly progression of AD and other forms of dementia.
      Sleep-dependent memory tasks need greater incorporation into OSA testing, with
      better delineation of sleep fragmentation versus intermittent hypoxia effects.
      Plasma biomarkers may prove to be sensitive, feasible, and scalable biomarkers
      for use in clinical trials. There is strong biological plausibility, but
      insufficient data, to prove bidirectional causality of the associations between
      OSA and aging pathology. Engaging, recruiting, and retaining diverse populations 
      in health care and research may help to decrease racial and ethnic disparities in
      OSA and AD. Key recommendations from the workshop include research aimed at
      underlying mechanisms; longer-term longitudinal studies with objective assessment
      of OSA, sensitive cognitive markers, and sleep-dependent cognitive tasks; and
      pragmatic study designs for interventional studies that control for other factors
      that may impact cognitive outcomes and use novel biomarkers.

AB  - Drug delivery systems that not only show efficacy through multiple therapeutic
      pathways but also facilitate patient drug use and exhibit a high bioavailability 
      profile represent a promising strategy in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease
      (AD). Here, donepezil (DO)/memantine (MM)/curcumin (CUR)-loaded electrospun
      nanofibers (NFs) were produced for the treatment of AD. DSC, XRD, and FT-IR
      studies demonstrated the complete incorporation of the drug into PVA/PVP NFs. The
      disintegration profile was improved by loading the drugs in PVA/PVP with fast
      wetting (less than 1 s), the start of disintegration (21 s), and dispersion in
      110 s. The desired properties for sublingual application were achieved with the
      dissolution of NFs in 240 s. The cell viability in DO/MM/CUR-loaded NFs was
      similar to the control group after 48 h in the cell culture. DO/MM/CUR-loaded NFs
      enhanced the expressions of BDNF (13.5-fold), TUBB3 (8.9-fold), Neurog2
      (5.6-fold), NeuroD1 (5.8-fold), Nestin (166-fold), and GFAP (115-fold).
      DO/MM/CUR-loaded NFs and powder of these drugs contained in these fibers were
      daily administered sublingually to intracerebroventricular-streptozotocin
      (icv-STZ) treated rats. DO/MM/CUR-loaded NFs treatment improved the short-term
      memory damage and enhanced memory, learning ability, and spatial exploration
      talent. Results indicated that the levels of Abeta, Tau protein, APP, GSK-3beta, 
      AChE, and TNF-alpha were significantly decreased, and BDNF was increased by
      DO/MM/CUR-loaded NFs treatment compared to the AD group. In the histopathological
      analysis of the hippocampus and cortex, neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary
      nodes were not observed in the rats treated with DO/MM/CUR-loaded NFs. Taken
      together, the sublingual route delivery of DO/MM/CUR-loaded NFs supports
      potential clinical applications for AD.

TI  - Association Between Cognition, Health Related Quality of Life, and Costs in a
      Population at Risk for Cognitive Decline.
LID - 10.3233/JAD-215304 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The association between health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and
      care costs in people at risk for cognitive decline is not well understood.
      Studying this association could reveal the potential benefits of increasing HRQoL
      and reducing care costs by improving cognition. OBJECTIVE: In this exploratory
      data analysis we investigated the association between cognition, HRQoL utilities 
      and costs in a well-functioning population at risk for cognitive decline.
      METHODS: An exploratory data analysis was conducted using longitudinal 2-year
      data from the FINGER study (n = 1,120). A change score analysis was applied using
      HRQoL utilities and total medical care costs as outcome. HRQoL utilities were
      derived from the Short Form Health Survey-36 (SF-36). Total care costs comprised 
      visits to a general practitioner, medical specialist, nurse, and days at
      hospital. Analyses were adjusted for activities of daily living (ADL) and
      depressive symptoms. RESULTS: Although univariable analysis showed an association
      between cognition and HRQoL utilities, multivariable analysis showed no
      association between cognition, HRQoL utilities and total care costs. A one-unit
      increase in ADL limitations was associated with a -0.006 (p < 0.001) decrease in 
      HRQoL utilities and a one-unit increase in depressive symptoms was associated
      with a -0.004 (p < 0.001) decrease in HRQoL utilities. CONCLUSION: The level of
      cognition in people at-risk for cognitive decline does not seem to be associated 
      with HRQoL utilities. Future research should examine the level at which cognitive
      decline starts to affect HRQoL and care costs. Ideally, this would be done by
      means of cross-validation in populations with various stages of cognitive
      functioning and decline.

TI  - Novel potent liposome agonists of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 
      2 phenocopy antibody treatment in cells.
LID - 10.1002/glia.24252 [doi]
AB  - The receptor Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is
      associated with several neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's Disease 
      and TREM2 stimulation represents a novel therapeutic opportunity. TREM2 can be
      activated by antibodies targeting the stalk region, most likely through receptor 
      dimerization. Endogenous ligands of TREM2 are suggested to be negatively charged 
      apoptotic bodies, mimicked by phosphatidylserine incorporated in liposomes and
      other polyanionic molecules likely binding to TREM2 IgV fold. However, there has 
      been much discrepancy in the literature on the nature of phospholipids (PLs) that
      can activate TREM2 and on the stability of the corresponding liposomes over time.
      We describe optimized liposomes as robust agonists selective for TREM2 over TREM1
      in cellular system. The detailed structure/activity relationship studies of lipid
      polar heads indicate that negatively charged lipid heads are required for
      activity and we identified the shortest maximally active PL sidechain. Optimized 
      liposomes are active on both TREM2 common variant and TREM2 R47H mutant. Activity
      and selectivity were further confirmed in different native TREM2 expressing cell 
      types including on integrated cellular responses such as stimulation of
      phagocytic activity. Such tool agonists will be useful in further studies of
      TREM2 biology in cellular systems alongside antibodies, and in the design of
      small molecule synthetic TREM2 agonists.

PG  - 897674
LID - 10.3389/fnagi.2022.897674 [doi]
AB  - Objective: The apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 allele is the main genetic risk
      factor for dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the underlying mechanism
      for the increased risk is not well understood. Cerebral small vessel disease
      (SVD) is prevalent among patients with cognitive impairment and is thought to
      play an important role in the pathophysiology of dementia. We aimed to
      investigate the association between the APOE epsilon genotype and magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) markers of SVD in a memory clinic population. Material
      and Methods: This is a cross-sectional study with a total of 520 patients
      undergoing dementia investigation, including an MRI brain scan and APOE
      genotyping in all patients enrolled, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis for
      routine AD biomarkers in 399 patients. MR images were assessed for markers of
      SVD: cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), cortical superficial siderosis, intracerebral
      hemorrhage, white matter hyperintensities, lacunar infarcts, and enlarged
      perivascular spaces. Results: Apolipoprotein E carriers with AD had a higher
      number of CMBs when looking at all brain regions and lobar brain regions (p <
      0.001). A lower number of CMBs were seen in APOE epsilon2 (p < 0.05), epsilon3
      and epsilon3/3 carriers (p < 0.001) when looking at all brain regions. A higher
      number of CMBs in deep and infratentorial regions were seen in APOE epsilon2 and 
      epsilon3 (p < 0.05). In APOE epsilon4/4 carriers, CMBs, cortical superficial
      siderosis, white matter hyperintensities, and enlarged perivascular spaces were
      associated with lower levels of CSF amyloid beta (Abeta) 42 in the whole cohort, 
      and in individuals with AD and mild cognitive impairment (p < 0.05). Conclusion: 
      Apolipoprotein E epsilon4 is associated with MRI markers of SVD related to
      amyloid pathology, specifically CMBs and Abeta42 plaque formation in the brain,
      as reflected by decreased CSF Abeta42 levels, whereas APOE epsilon3 and epsilon2 
      are associated with the markers of hypertensive arteriopathy, as reflected by the
      association with CMBs in deep and infratentorial brain regions.

PG  - 909738
LID - 10.3389/fnagi.2022.909738 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: The relationship between preoperative serum uric acid (SUA) and
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Alzheimer-related biomarkers were investigated to
      determine whether high SUA is a potential risk factor for postoperative delirium 
      (POD) and to evaluate its predictive efficacy. Methods: The participants were
      selected from the Perioperative Neurocognitive Disorder Risk Factor and Prognosis
      (PNDRFAP) study and the Perioperative Neurocognitive Disorder and Biomarker
      Lifestyle (PNDABLE) study. The logistic regression equation was used to analyze
      the risk factors and protective factors of POD. The interaction term (SUA x Sex) 
      was introduced into the linear model to explore the potential modification
      effects of sex on the identified correlations. We analyzed the mediating effects 
      of Alzheimer-related biomarkers. Finally, we constructed the receiver operating
      characteristic (ROC) curve and the nomogram model to evaluate the efficacy of SUA
      and Alzheimer-related biomarkers in predicting POD. Results: Patients with POD
      had elevated SUA level (PNDRFAP: p = 0.002, PNDABLE: p < 0.001). Preoperative SUA
      level was positively correlated with CSF phosphorylated tau (P-tau) (p = 0.027)
      and beta-amyloid42 (Abeta42)/P-tau (p = 0.023). Interaction analysis did not find
      any modification effect of sex. The relationship between SUA and POD was
      partially mediated by CSF P-tau (15.3%). ROC curve showed that the model
      combining SUA and Alzheimer-related biomarkers had better performance in
      predicting POD [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.880; p < 0.001], and the
      predictive model is accurate. Conclusions: High SUA may enhance CSF P-tau level, 
      thus increasing the risk of POD, and the model combining SUA and
      Alzheimer-related biomarkers can accurately predict the occurrence of POD.

AB  - Introduction: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and age-related eye diseases pose an
      increasing burden as the world's population ages. However, there is limited
      understanding on the association of AD/cognitive impairment, no dementia (CIND)
      with age-related eye diseases. Methods: In this cross-sectional, memory
      clinic-based study of multiethnic Asians aged 50 and above, participants were
      diagnosed as AD (n = 216), cognitive impairment, no dementia (CIND) (n = 252),
      and no cognitive impairment (NCI) (n = 124) according to internationally accepted
      criteria. Retinal photographs were graded for the presence of age-related macular
      degeneration (AMD) and diabetic retinopathy (DR) using standard grading systems. 
      Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models were used to determine the
      associations between neurological diagnosis and odds of having eye diseases.
      Results: Over half of the adults had at least one eye disease, with AMD being the
      most common (60.1%; n = 356), followed by DR (8.4%; n = 50). After controlling
      for age, sex, race, educational level, and marital status, persons with AD were
      more likely to have moderate DR or worse (OR = 2.95, 95% CI = 1.15-7.60) compared
      with NCI. In the fully adjusted model, the neurological diagnosis was not
      associated with AMD (OR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.45-1.24). Conclusion: Patients with AD
      have an increased odds of having moderate DR or worse, which suggests that these 
      vulnerable individuals may benefit from specific social support and screening for
      eye diseases.

AB  - Background: Depressive symptoms and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are highly
      prevalent in rural China. The study aimed to investigate the longitudinal
      associations between changes in depressive symptoms and cognitive decline and MCI
      incidence among Chinese rural elderly individuals. Methods: A 2-year follow-up
      study was conducted among 1,477 participants from the Anhui Healthy Longevity
      Survey (AHLS). Depressive symptoms were assessed by the 9-item Patient Health
      Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and cognitive status was evaluated by the Mini Mental
      State Examination (MMSE). Multivariable linear regression and logistic regression
      were employed. Results: Every 1-unit PHQ-9 score increase was significantly
      associated with more cognitive decline (beta = 0.157, 95% CI: 0.092, 0.221, p <
      0.001) and a higher risk of MCI incidence (OR = 1.063, 95% CI: 1.025, 1.103, p = 
      0.001). The participants who experienced worsening of depression symptoms had a
      larger decline in the 2-year MMSE score (beta = 0.650, 95% CI: 0.039, 1.261, p = 
      0.037) and elevated risks of incident MCI (OR = 1.573, 95% CI: 1.113, 2.223, p = 
      0.010). Limitations: Screening tools rather than standard diagnostic procedures
      were used in the study. Moreover, the long-term associations still need further
      exploration since the follow-up time was short. Conclusions: Increased depressive
      symptoms were associated with more cognitive decline and higher risks of incident
      MCI among Chinese rural residents.

AB  - A high incidence of dementia (60-80%) and a high rate of memory loss are two of
      the most common symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which affects the elderly. 
      Researchers have recommended that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Indian
      medicines can be used to prevent and cure AD. Several studies have linked
      neuroinflammation linked to amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition in the brain to the
      pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders. As a result, more research is
      needed to determine the role of inflammation in neurodegeneration. Increased
      microglial activation, cytokine production, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and
      nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) all play a role in the inflammatory process of
      AD. This review focuses on the role of neuroinflammation in neuroprotection and
      the molecular processes used by diverse natural substances, phytochemicals, and
      herbal formulations in distinct signaling pathways. Currently, researchers are
      focusing on pharmacologically active natural compounds with the
      anti-neuroinflammatory potential, making them a possible contender for treating
      AD. Furthermore, the researchers investigated the limits of past studies on TCM, 
      Indian Ayurveda, and AD. Numerous studies have been carried out to examine the
      effects of medicinal whole-plant extracts on AD. Clinical investigations have
      shown that lignans, flavonoids, tannins, polyphenols, triterpenoids, sterols, and
      alkaloids have anti-inflammatory, antiamyloidogenic, anticholinesterase, and
      antioxidant properties. This review summarizes information about numerous
      medicinal plants and isolated compounds used in the treatment of AD and a list of
      further references.

AB  - The abnormal phosphorylation of tau is a necessary precursor to the formation of 
      tau fibrils, a marker of Alzheimer's disease. We hypothesize that
      hyperphosphorylative conditions may result in unique cell surface markers. We
      identify and demonstrate the utility of such surrogate markers to identify the
      hyperphosphorylative state. Methods: Cell SELEX was used to identify novel
      thioaptamers specifically binding hyperphosphorylative cells. Cell surface
      vimentin was identified as a potential binding target of the aptamer. Novel
      molecular magnetic resonance imaging (M-MRI) probes using these aptamers and a
      small molecule ligand to vimentin were used for in vivo detection of this
      pre-pathological state. Results: In a mouse model of pathological tau, we
      demonstrated in vivo visualization of the hyperphosphorylative state by M-MRI,
      enabling the identification at a pre-pathological stage of mice that develop
      frank tau pathology several months later. In vivo visualization of the
      hyperphosphorylative state by M-MRI was further validated in a second mouse model
      (APP/PS1) of Alzheimer's disease again identifying the mutants at a
      pre-pathological stage. Conclusions: M-MRI of the hyperphosphorylative state
      identifies future tau pathology and could enable extremely early-stage diagnosis 
      of Alzheimer's disease, at a pre-patholgical stage.

AB  - The health, well-being, and financial security of Americans are greatly impacted 
      by Alzheimer's disease. The forecast paints an upward trajectory with the number 
      of Americans suffering from Alzheimer's disease and related dementia. To discuss 
      the Alzheimer's crisis, The Senate Committee on Finance, Subcommittee on Health
      Care, held a hearing titled, "The Alzheimer's Crisis: Examining, Testing, and
      Treatment Pipelines and Fiscal Implications," on December 16, 2020. Here, we
      summarize and expand on the discussion of the panel and its review of recent
      progress, ongoing challenges associated with Alzheimer's disease, and potential
      initiatives that promise to speed progress in developing treatments and improving
      care.

      disease and related dementias.
PG  - e12331
LID - 10.1002/trc2.12331 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Despite evidence that Hispanic/Latino populations are 1.5 times
      more likely than non-Latino Whites to develop Alzheimer's disease and related
      dementias (ADRD), Latinos are underrepresented in clinical trials testing
      treatments for ADRD. Data are needed on facilitators of ADRD clinical trial
      participation in Latinos. We leveraged in-depth qualitative methods to elucidate 
      barriers and facilitators to participating in ADRD clinical trials in a large and
      diverse sample of Latinos; and to provide timely and actionable strategies to
      accelerate representation of Latinos in clinical trials on ADRD. Methods: Data
      were collected in California between January 2019 and June 2020 from 25 focus
      groups (FGs): eight with Latino adults ages 18 to 49 (n = 54), nine with Latino
      adults ages 50+ (n = 75), and eight with caregivers of Latino older adults with
      ADRD (n = 52). Twelve community-based organization administrators were also
      interviewed. Transcripts of FGs and interviews were entered into Atlas.ti
      software. Three independent team members analyzed the transcripts with
      inductive/deductive qualitative content analysis. We triangulated data from
      stakeholder groups across sites, we used collaborative coding, and used the
      Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research. Results: An overarching
      theme was a tension between wanting to learn more about ADRD and to participate
      in ADRD research but having limited awareness and opportunity. Five themes were
      identified: (1) remaining in limbo, (2) wanting information about ADRD, (3)
      wanting information on research about ADRD, (4) clearing researchers through
      trusted local organizations, and (5) practicing altruism through engagement in
      research opportunities. Discussion: To increase representation of Latino
      communities in clinical trials on ADRD, bilingual information and education on
      ADRD and clinical trials needs to be better disseminated. Also, working with
      trusted local, regional, and national organizations can increase participation.
      Importantly, Latino participation can increase when research teams demonstrate
      altruistic actions and inform participants of public health reasons requiring
      their involvement. HIGHLIGHTS: Participation in clinical trials on Alzheimer's
      disease and related dementias (ADRD) is limited among Latinos/Hispanics.Knowing
      the high prevalence of ADRD in Latinos increases willingness to
      participate.Observing altruism from researchers increases willingness to
      participate.Invitations from multiple organizations increases willingness to
      participate.Researchers should include public health reasons requiring Latinos'
      involvement.

TI  - The Coaching for Cognition in Alzheimer's (COCOA) trial: Study design.
PG  - e12318
LID - 10.1002/trc2.12318 [doi]
AB  - Comprehensive treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) requires not only
      pharmacologic treatment but also management of existing medical conditions and
      lifestyle modifications including diet, cognitive training, and exercise. We
      present the design and methodology for the Coaching for Cognition in Alzheimer's 
      (COCOA) trial. AD and other dementias result from the interplay of multiple
      interacting dysfunctional biological systems. Monotherapies have had limited
      success. More interventional studies are needed to test the effectiveness of
      multimodal multi-domain therapies for dementia prevention and treatment.
      Multimodal therapies use multiple interventions to address multiple systemic
      causes and potentiators of cognitive decline and functional loss; they can be
      personalized, as different sets of etiologies and systems responsive to therapy
      may be present in different individuals. COCOA is designed to test the hypothesis
      that coached multimodal interventions beneficially alter the trajectory of
      cognitive decline for individuals on the spectrum of AD and related dementias
      (ADRD). COCOA is a two-arm prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT). COCOA
      collects psychometric, clinical, lifestyle, genomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and 
      microbiome data at multiple timepoints across 2 years for each participant. These
      data enable systems biology analyses. One arm receives standard of care and
      generic healthy aging recommendations. The other arm receives standard of care
      and personalized data-driven remote coaching. The primary outcome measure is the 
      Memory Performance Index (MPI), a measure of cognition. The MPI is a summary
      statistic of the MCI Screen (MCIS). Secondary outcome measures include the
      Functional Assessment Staging Test (FAST), a measure of function. COCOA began
      enrollment in January 2018. We hypothesize that multimodal interventions will
      ameliorate cognitive decline and that data-driven health coaching will increase
      compliance, assist in personalizing multimodal interventions, and improve
      outcomes for patients, particularly for those in the early stages of the AD
      spectrum. Highlights: The Coaching for Cognition in Alzheimer's (COCOA) trial
      tests personalized multimodal lifestyle interventions for Alzheimer's disease and
      related dementias.Dense longitudinal molecular data will be useful for future
      studies.Increased use of Hill's criteria in analyses may advance knowledge
      generation.Remote coaching may be an effective intervention.Because lifestyle
      interventions are inexpensive, they may be particularly valuable in reducing
      global socioeconomic disparities in dementia care.

PG  - e12341
LID - 10.1002/trc2.12341 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: The objective of this study was to identify home health utilization
      factors associated with successful discharge to community after home health care 
      for patients with and without Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD).
      Methods: This was a retrospective study of 100% national Medicare home health
      data files (2016 to 2017). Multilevel logistic regression was used to study the
      relationship of home health utilization with a modified definition of successful 
      discharge to community (M-SDC) after home health (no readmission or discharge
      within 30 days). Significant interactions were identified using backward
      selection. The associations between domains were examined in a model stratified
      by ADRD, with and without controlling for mobility, self-care, and caregiver
      assistance. Results: The cohort consisted of 535,691 patients, 18.0% with ADRD.
      The overall M-SDC rate was 92.1%. The likelihood of M-SDC was increased when
      physical therapy services were provided, episodes of care were longer than 15
      days, and the total number of therapy visits was greater than 10. The likelihood 
      of M-SDC decreased when speech therapy, nursing, and home health aide services
      were provided and when patients were discharged early. When controlling for
      mobility, self-care, and caregiver support, length of home health episode was the
      only characteristic that showed a significant interaction with ADRD. Discussion: 
      The results of this study indicate that the provision of physical therapy
      services and moderate lengths of care and volume of visits are associated with
      increased likelihood of M-SDC. A decreased likelihood of M-SDC when speech
      therapy, nursing, and home health aide services are delivered may be a proxy
      indicator of patient acuity and disease severity and needs to be further
      investigated. An important next step in understanding home health access and
      outcomes for people with ADRD is to examine the impact of the Patient-Driven
      Groupings Model on home health utilization characteristics, especially length of 
      episodes. Highlights: Most people remain in the community after discharge from
      home health.Likelihood of modified successful discharge to community (M-SDC)
      increased with physical therapy, longer episodes, and more than 10
      visits.Likelihood of M-SDC decreased with speech therapy, skilled nursing, home
      health aide visits, and early discharge.Longer home health episodes increased
      likelihood of M-SDC for people with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.

      pathology in a stem cell model of Down syndrome.
PG  - e12334
LID - 10.1002/trc2.12334 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Retromer complex proteins are decreased in Down syndrome (DS)
      brains and correlate inversely with brain amyloidosis. However, whether retromer 
      dysfunction contributes to the amyloid beta (Abeta) and tau neuropathology of DS 
      remains unknown. Methods: Human trisomic induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs)
      and isogenic controls were differentiated into forebrain neurons, and changes in 
      retromer proteins, tau phosphorylated epitopes, and Abeta levels were assessed in
      euploid and trisomic neurons using western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent
      assay (ELISA). Genetic overexpression and pharmacological retromer stabilization 
      were used to determine the functional role of the retromer complex system in
      modulating amyloid and tau pathology. Results: Trisomic neurons developed
      age-dependent retromer core protein deficiency associated with accumulation of
      Abeta peptides and phosphorylated tau isoforms. Enhancing retromer function
      through overexpression or pharmacological retromer stabilization reduced amyloid 
      and tau pathology in trisomic neurons. However, the effect was greater using a
      pharmacological approach, suggesting that targeting the complex stability may be 
      more effective in addressing this neuropathology in DS. Discussion: Our results

AB  - Widespread access to emerging information and communication technologies (ICT)
      allows its use for the screening of diseases in the general population. At the
      initiative of the Spanish Confederation of Associations of Families of People
      with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (CEAFA), a website
      (http://www.problemasmemoria.com) has been created that provides information
      about Alzheimer's disease and includes questionnaires to be completed by family
      or friends concerned about memory problems of a relative. A cross-sectional,
      randomized, multicenter study was performed to evaluate feasibility, validity,
      and user satisfaction with an electronic method of completion vs. the current
      method of paper-based questionnaires for clinically dementia screening completed 
      by the informants: the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the
      Elderly (IQCODE) and the Alzheimer's disease-8 screening test (AD8). A total of
      111 pairs were recruited by seven memory clinics. Informants completed IQCODE and
      AD8 questionnaires both in their paper and electronic versions. The correlation
      between paper and electronic versions was significantly positive for IQCODE (r = 
      0.98; p < 0.001) and AD8 (r = 0.96; p < 0.001). The execution time did not differ
      significantly, and participants considered their use equally easy. This study
      shows that an electronic version of the IQCODE and AD8 questionnaires is suitable
      for its online use via the internet and achieves the same results as the
      traditional paper versions.

TI  - Type-I Interferons in Alzheimer's Disease and Other Tauopathies.
PG  - 949340
LID - 10.3389/fncel.2022.949340 [doi]
AB  - The detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns can elicit the production
      of type-I interferons (IFNs), soluble cytokines that induce a transcriptional
      state inhibitory to viral replication. Signatures of type-I IFN-driven gene
      expression, and type-I IFNs themselves, are observed in the central nervous
      system during neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease and other 
      tauopathies, the umbrella term for diseases that feature aggregation of the
      cytosolic protein tau. The contribution of the type-I IFN response to
      pathological progression of these diseases, however, is not well-understood. The 
      wholesale transcriptional changes that ensue from type-I IFN production can both 
      promote protective effects and lead to damage dependent on the context and
      duration of the response. The type-I IFN system therefore represents a signaling 
      pathway with a potential disease-modifying role in the progression of
      neurodegenerative disease. In this review we summarize the evidence for a type-I 
      IFN signature in AD and other tauopathies and examine the role of aggregated
      proteins as inflammatory stimuli. We explore both the protective role of IFN
      against protein pathologies as well as their downstream toxic consequences, which
      include the exacerbation of protein pathology as a potentially destructive
      feed-forward loop. Given the involvement of type-I IFNs in other neurogenerative 
      diseases, we draw comparisons with other categories of homotypic protein
      aggregation. Understanding how type-I IFN influences progression of AD and other 
      tauopathies may yield important insight to neurodegeneration and identify new
      targets in an area currently lacking disease-modifying therapies.

AB  - EEG, or Electroencephalogram, is an instrument that examines the brain's
      functions while it is executing any activity. EEG signals to aid in the
      identification of brain processes and movements and are thus useful in the
      detection of neurobiological illnesses. Pulses have a very weak magnitude and are
      recorded from peak to peak, with pulse width ranging from 0.5 to 100 V, which is 
      around 100 times below than ECG signals. As a result, many types of noise can
      easily influence them. Because EEG signals are so important in detecting brain
      illnesses, it is critical to preprocess them for accurate assessment and
      detection. The crown of your head The EEG is a weighted combination of the
      signals generated by the different small locations beneath the electrodes on the 
      cortical plate. The rhythm of electrical impulses is useful for evaluating a
      broad range of brain diseases. Hypertension, Alzheimer, and brain damage are all 
      possibilities. We can compare and distinguish the brainwaves for different
      emotions and illnesses linked with the brain by studying the EEG signal. Multiple
      research studies and methodologies for preprocessing, extraction of features, and
      evaluation of EEG data have recently been created. The use of EEG in
      human-computer communication could be a novel and demanding field that has
      acquired traction in recent years. We present predictive modeling for analyzing
      the customer's preference of likes and dislikes via EEG signal in our report. The
      impulses were obtained when clients used the Internet to seek for multiple items.
      The studies were carried out on a dataset that included a variety of consumer
      goods.

      APP-transgenic Alzheimer's disease mice.
LID - 10.1111/acel.13679 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia in the elderly, is
      pathologically characterized by extracellular deposition of amyloid-beta peptides
      (Abeta) and microglia-dominated inflammatory activation in the brain.
      p38alpha-MAPK is activated in both neurons and microglia. How p38alpha-MAPK in
      microglia contributes to AD pathogenesis remains unclear. In this study, we
      conditionally knocked out p38alpha-MAPK in all myeloid cells or specifically in
      microglia of APP-transgenic mice, and examined animals for AD-associated
      pathologies (i.e., cognitive deficits, Abeta pathology, and neuroinflammation)
      and individual microglia for their inflammatory activation and Abeta
      internalization at different disease stages (e.g., at 4 and 9 months of age). Our
      experiments showed that p38alpha-MAPK-deficient myeloid cells were more effective
      than p38alpha-MAPK-deficient microglia in reducing cerebral Abeta and neuronal
      impairment in APP-transgenic mice. Deficiency of p38alpha-MAPK in myeloid cells
      inhibited inflammatory activation of individual microglia at 4 months but
      enhanced it at 9 months. Inflammatory activation promoted microglial
      internalization of Abeta. Interestingly, p38alpha-MAPK-deficient myeloid cells
      reduced IL-17a-expressing CD4-positive lymphocytes in 9 but not 4-month-old
      APP-transgenic mice. By cross-breeding APP-transgenic mice with Il-17a-knockout
      mice, we observed that IL-17a deficiency potentially activated microglia and
      reduced Abeta deposition in the brain as shown in 9-month-old myeloid
      p38alpha-MAPK-deficient AD mice. Thus, p38alpha-MAPK deficiency in all myeloid
      cells, but not only in microglia, prevents AD progression. IL-17a-expressing
      lymphocytes may partially mediate the pathogenic role of p38alpha-MAPK in
      peripheral myeloid cells. Our study supports p38alpha-MAPK as a therapeutic
      target for AD patients.

AB  - The basal levels of intracellular Zn(2+) and extracellular Zn(2+) are in the
      range of 100 pM and 10 nM, respectively, in the brain. Extracellular Zn(2+)
      dynamics is involved in both cognitive performance and neurodegeneration. The
      bidirectional actions are linked with extracellular glutamate and
      amyloid-beta1-42 (Abeta1-42). Intracellular Zn(2+) signaling via extracellular
      glutamate is required for learning and memory, while intracellular Zn(2+)
      dysregulation induces cognitive decline. Furthermore, human Abeta1-42, a
      causative peptide in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis captures extracellular
      Zn(2+) and readily taken up into hippocampal neurons followed by intracellular
      Zn(2+) dysregulation. Abeta1-42-mediated intracellular Zn(2+) dysregulation is
      accelerated with aging, because extracellular Zn(2+) is age-relatedly increased, 
      resulting in Abeta1-42-induced cognitive decline and neurodegeneration with
      aging. On the other hand, metallothioneins, zinc-binding proteins can capture
      Zn(2+) released from intracellular Zn-Abeta1-42 complexes and serve for
      intracellular Zn(2+)-buffering to maintain intracellular Zn(2+) homeostasis. This
      review summarizes Zn(2+) function and its neurotoxicity in the brain, and also
      the potential defense strategy via metallothioneins against Abeta1-42-induced
      pathogenesis.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a central nervous system disease characterised by
      degenerative cognitive dysfunction and memory loss. In a society where the global
      population is gradually ageing, the health threats and financial burdens caused
      by AD are becoming increasingly severe since AD often occurs in old age. With the
      in-depth study of AD, many new pathogenic mechanisms have been proposed, among
      which bidirectional communication between intestinal microbes and the brain has
      attracted widespread attention. The aetiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
      is related to the imbalance of the gut microbiota. Epidemiological investigations
      have shown that patients with IBD are more likely to suffer from AD. Targeting
      IBD as a potential AD treatment target has attracted considerable interest. Here,
      we reviewed the link between chronic intestinal inflammation and central nervous 
      system inflammation and found that IBD patients had a higher risk of AD than
      non-IBD patients. Preclinical models based on AD also showed that IBD aggravated 
      the condition of AD. We discussed possible biological links between AD and IBD,
      including the gut-brain axis, autoimmunity, and the gut microbiota. In addition, 
      IBD-induced changes in intestinal microbial metabolites, such as short-chain
      fatty acids, bile acids, and tryptophan, which aggravate the development of AD,
      were also discussed.

AB  - Sedentary behaviour may increase the risk of dementia. Studying physiological
      effects of sedentary behaviour on cerebral health may provide new insights into
      the nature of this association. Accordingly, we reviewed if and how acute and
      habitual sedentary behaviour relate to brain health factors in middle-aged and
      older adults (>/=45 years). Four databases were searched. Twenty-nine studies
      were included, with mainly cross-sectional designs. Nine studies examined
      neurotrophic factors and six studied functional brain measures, with the majority
      of these studies finding no associations with sedentary behaviour. The results
      from studies on sedentary behaviour and cerebrovascular measures were
      inconclusive. There was a tentative association between habitual sedentary
      behaviour and structural white matter health. An explanatory pathway for this
      effect might relate to the immediate vascular effects of sitting, such as
      elevation of blood pressure. Nevertheless, due to the foremost cross-sectional
      nature of the available evidence, reverse causality could also be a possible
      explanation. More prospective studies are needed to understand the potential of
      sedentary behaviour as a target for brain health.

AB  - Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid
      cells-2 (sTREM2) is an emerging biomarker of neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's
      disease (AD). Yet, sTREM2 expression has not been systematically evaluated in
      relation to concomitant drivers of neuroinflammation. While associations between 
      sTREM2 and tau in CSF are established, we sought to determine additional
      biological correlates of CSF sTREM2 during the prodromal stages of AD by
      evaluating CSF Abeta species (Abetax-40), a fluid biomarker of blood-brain
      barrier integrity (CSF/plasma albumin ratio), and CSF biomarkers of
      neurodegeneration measured in 155 participants from the Vanderbilt Memory and
      Aging Project. A novel association between high CSF levels of both sTREM2 and
      Abetax-40 was observed and replicated in an independent dataset. Abetax-40
      levels, as well as the CSF/plasma albumin ratio, explained additional and unique 
      variance in sTREM2 levels above and beyond that of CSF biomarkers of
      neurodegeneration. The component of sTREM2 levels correlated with Abetax-40
      levels best predicted future cognitive performance. We highlight potential
      contributions of Abeta homeostasis and blood-brain barrier integrity to elevated 
      CSF sTREM2, underscoring novel biomarker associations relevant to disease
      progression and clinical outcome measures.

TI  - Determining the OPTIMAL DTI analysis method for application in cerebral small
      vessel disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: DTI is sensitive to white matter (WM) microstructural damage and has 
      been suggested as a surrogate marker for phase 2 clinical trials in cerebral
      small vessel disease (SVD). The study's objective is to establish the best way to
      analyse the diffusion-weighted imaging data in SVD for this purpose. The ideal
      method would be sensitive to change and predict dementia conversion, but also
      straightforward to implement and ideally automated. As part of the OPTIMAL
      collaboration, we evaluated five different DTI analysis strategies across six
      different cohorts with differing SVD severity. METHODS: Those 5 strategies were: 
      (1) conventional mean diffusivity WM histogram measure (MD median), (2) a
      principal component-derived measure based on conventional WM histogram measures
      (PC1), (3) peak width skeletonized mean diffusivity (PSMD), (4) diffusion tensor 
      image segmentation theta (DSEG theta) and (5) a WM measure of global network
      efficiency (Geff). The association between each measure and cognitive function
      was tested using a linear regression model adjusted by clinical markers. Changes 
      in the imaging measures over time were determined. In three cohort studies,
      repeated imaging data together with data on incident dementia were available. The
      association between the baseline measure, change measure and incident dementia
      conversion was examined using Cox proportional-hazard regression or logistic
      regression models. Sample size estimates for a hypothetical clinical trial were
      furthermore computed for each DTI analysis strategy. RESULTS: There was a
      consistent cross-sectional association between the imaging measures and impaired 
      cognitive function across all cohorts. All baseline measures predicted dementia
      conversion in severe SVD. In mild SVD, PC1, PSMD and Geff predicted dementia
      conversion. In MCI, all markers except Geff predicted dementia conversion.
      Baseline DTI was significantly different in patients converting to vascular
      dementia than to Alzheimer' s disease. Significant change in all measures was
      associated with dementia conversion in severe but not in mild SVD. The automatic 
      and semi-automatic measures PSMD and DSEG theta required the lowest minimum
      sample sizes for a hypothetical clinical trial in single-centre sporadic SVD
      cohorts. CONCLUSION: DTI parameters obtained from all analysis methods predicted 
      dementia, and there was no clear winner amongst the different analysis
      strategies. The fully automated analysis provided by PSMD offers advantages
      particularly for large datasets.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify and validate a gray matter volume network 
      in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: To identify a disease-related
      network, a principal component analysis-based algorithm, Scaled Subprofile Model,
      was applied to gray matter volume data derived from structural T1-weighted
      magnetic resonance imaging of the training sample that consisted of nine patients
      with AD (women, four; dementia, seven; mild cognitive impairment, two; age, 66.7 
      +/- 8.8 [mean +/- SD] years) with positive (18)F-flutemetamol amyloid positron
      emission tomography and eight age-matched healthy controls obtained on-site. The 
      network expression scores were calculated by topographic profile rating in the
      validation sample obtained via the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies and
      comprised 12 patients with AD dementia (women, four; age, 70.0 +/- 3.7 years) and
      12 age-matched healthy controls. RESULTS: A significant network from the training
      sample, for which subject expression differed between the groups (permutation
      test, P = 0.006; sensitivity and specificity, 100%; area under the curve, 1), was
      identified. This network was represented by the principal components 1, 2, and 3 
      and showed a relative decrease in the inferior parietal lobule including angular 
      gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus, premotor cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, and
      precuneus. It significantly differed between the groups with a sensitivity,
      specificity, and area under the curve of 83%, 91%, and 0.85, respectively, in the
      validation sample (P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: An AD-related gray matter volume
      network that captured relevant regions was identified in amyloid positron
      emission tomography-positive patients and validated in an independent sample.

AB  - Blood-based markers (BBMs) have recently shown promise to revolutionize the
      diagnostic and prognostic work-up of Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as to
      improve the design of interventional trials. Here we discuss in detail further
      research needed to be performed before widespread use of BBMs. We already now
      recommend use of BBMs as (pre-)screeners to identify individuals likely to have
      AD pathological changes for inclusion in trials evaluating disease-modifying
      therapies, provided the AD status is confirmed with positron emission tomography 
      (PET) or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing. We also encourage studying
      longitudinal BBM changes in ongoing as well as future interventional trials.
      However, BBMs should not yet be used as primary endpoints in pivotal trials.
      Further, we recommend to cautiously start using BBMs in specialized memory
      clinics as part of the diagnostic work-up of patients with cognitive symptoms and
      the results should be confirmed whenever possible with CSF or PET. Additional
      data are needed before use of BBMs as stand-alone diagnostic AD markers, or
      before considering use in primary care.

TI  - Association of Elevated Amyloid and Tau Positron Emission Tomography Signal With 
      Near-Term Development of Alzheimer Disease Symptoms in Older Adults Without
      Cognitive Impairment.
LID - 10.1001/jamaneurol.2022.2379 [doi]
AB  - Importance: National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA)
      workgroups have proposed biological research criteria intended to identify
      individuals with preclinical Alzheimer disease (AD). Objective: To assess the
      clinical value of these biological criteria to identify older individuals without
      cognitive impairment who are at near-term risk of developing symptomatic AD.
      Design, Setting, and Participants: This longitudinal cohort study used data from 
      4 independent population-based cohorts (PREVENT-AD, HABS, AIBL, and Knight ADRC) 
      collected between 2003 and 2021. Participants were older adults without cognitive
      impairment with 1 year or more of clinical observation after amyloid beta and tau
      positron emission tomography (PET). Median clinical follow-up after PET ranged
      from 1.94 to 3.66 years. Exposures: Based on binary assessment of global amyloid 
      burden (A) and a composite temporal region of tau PET uptake (T), participants
      were stratified into 4 groups (A+T+, A+T-, A-T+, A-T-). Presence (+) or absence
      (-) of neurodegeneration (N) was assessed using temporal cortical thickness. Main
      Outcomes and Measures: Each cohort was analyzed separately. Primary outcome was
      clinical progression to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), identified by a Clinical
      Dementia Rating score of 0.5 or greater in Knight ADRC and by consensus committee
      review in the other cohorts. Clinical raters were blind to imaging, genetic, and 
      fluid biomarker data. A secondary outcome was cognitive decline, based on a slope
      greater than 1.5 SD below the mean of an independent subsample of individuals
      without cognitive impairment. Outcomes were compared across the biomarker groups.
      Results: Among 580 participants (PREVENT-AD, 128; HABS, 153; AIBL, 48; Knight
      ADRC, 251), mean (SD) age ranged from 67 (5) to 76 (6) years across cohorts, with
      between 55% (137/251) and 74% (95/128) female participants. Across cohorts, 33%
      to 83% of A+T+ participants progressed to MCI during follow-up (mean progression 
      time, 2-2.72 years), compared with less than 20% of participants in other
      biomarker groups. Progression further increased to 43% to 100% when restricted to
      A+T+(N+) individuals. Cox proportional hazard ratios for progression to MCI in
      the A+T+ group vs other biomarker groups were all 5 or greater. Many A+T+
      nonprogressors also showed longitudinal cognitive decline, while cognitive
      trajectories in other groups remained predominantly stable. Conclusions and
      Relevance: The clinical prognostic value of NIA-AA research criteria was
      confirmed in 4 independent cohorts, with most A+T+(N+) older individuals without 
      cognitive impairment developing AD symptoms within 2 to 3 years.

TI  - Aging the brain: multi-region methylation principal component based clock in the 
      context of Alzheimer's disease.
LID - 10.18632/aging.204196 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk increases exponentially with age and is associated 
      with multiple molecular hallmarks of aging, one of which is epigenetic
      alterations. Epigenetic age predictors based on 5' cytosine methylation (DNAm),
      or epigenetic clocks, have previously suggested that epigenetic age acceleration 
      may occur in AD brain tissue. Epigenetic clocks are promising tools for the
      quantification of biological aging, yet we hypothesize that investigation of
      brain aging in AD will be assisted by the development of brain-specific
      epigenetic clocks. Therefore, we generated a novel age predictor termed
      PCBrainAge that was trained solely in cortical samples. This predictor utilizes a
      combination of principal components analysis and regularized regression, which
      reduces technical noise and greatly improves test-retest reliability. To
      characterize the scope of PCBrainAge's utility, we generated DNAm data from
      multiple brain regions in a sample from the Religious Orders Study and Rush
      Memory and Aging Project. PCBrainAge captures meaningful heterogeneity of aging: 
      Its acceleration demonstrates stronger associations with clinical AD dementia,
      pathologic AD, and APOE epsilon4 carrier status compared to extant epigenetic age
      predictors. It further does so across multiple cortical and subcortical regions. 
      Overall, PCBrainAge's increased reliability and specificity makes it a
      particularly promising tool for investigating heterogeneity in brain aging, as
      well as epigenetic alterations underlying AD risk and resilience.

TI  - Abeta1-42 peptides blunt the adenosine A2A receptor-mediated control of the

      astrocytes.

AB  - The contribution of astrocytes to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still ill defined. 
      AD involves an abnormal accumulation of amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) and
      increased production of danger signals such as ATP. ATP can direct or indirectly,
      through its metabolism into adenosine, trigger adaptive astrocytic responses
      resulting from intracellular Ca(2+) oscillations. AD also triggers an
      upregulation of astrocytic adenosine A2A receptors (A2AR), which blockade
      prevents memory dysfunction in AD. We now investigated how Abeta peptides affect 
      ATP-mediated Ca(2+) responses in astrocytes measured by fluorescence live-cell
      imaging and whether A2AR control astrocytic Ca(2+) responses mediated by ATP
      receptors, mainly P2X7R and P2Y1R. In primary cultures of rat astrocytes exposed 
      to Abeta1-42, ATP-evoked Ca(2+) responses had a lower amplitude but a longer
      duration than in control astrocytes and involved P2X7R and P2Y1R, the former
      potentiating the later. Moreover, Abeta1-42 exposure increased protein levels of 
      P2Y1R in astrocytes. A2AR antagonism with SCH58261 controlled in a protein kinase
      A-dependent manner both P2X7R- and P2Y1R-mediated Ca(2+) responses in astrocytes.
      The interplay between these purinoceptors in astrocytes was blunted upon exposure
      to Abeta1-42. These findings uncover the ability of A2AR to regulate the
      inter-twinned P2X7R- and P2Y1R-mediated Ca(2+) dynamics in astrocytes, which is
      disrupted in conditions of early AD.

AB  - The metabolic syndrome (MetS) has been well linked with coronary heart disease
      (CHD) in the general population, but studies have rarely explored their
      association among patients with stroke. We examine prevalence of MetS and its
      association with CHD in patients with first-ever ischemic stroke. This
      hospital-based study included 1851 patients with first-ever ischemic stroke (mean
      age 61.2 years, 36.5% women) who were hospitalized into two university hospitals 
      in Shandong, China (January 2016-February 2017). Data were collected through
      interviews, physical examinations, and laboratory tests. MetS was defined
      following the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) criteria, the
      International Diabetes Federation (IDF) criteria, and the Chinese Diabetes
      Society (CDS) criteria. CHD was defined following clinical criteria. Data were
      analyzed using binary logistic regression models. The overall prevalence of MetS 
      was 33.4% by NECP criteria, 47.2% by IDF criteria, and 32.5% by CDS criteria,
      with the prevalence being decreased with age and higher in women than in men (p <
      0.05). High blood pressure, high triglycerides, and low HDL-C were significantly 
      associated with CHD (multi-adjusted odds ratio [OR] range 1.27-1.38, p < 0.05).
      The multi-adjusted OR of CHD associated with MetS defined by the NECP criteria,
      IDF criteria, and CDS criteria (vs. no MetS) was 1.27 (95% confidence interval
      1.03-1.57), 1.44 (1.18-1.76), and 1.27 (1.03-1.57), respectively. In addition,
      having 1-2 abnormal components (vs. none) of MetS was associated with CHD
      (multi-adjusted OR range 1.66-1.72, p < 0.05). MetS affects over one-third of
      patients with first-ever ischemic stroke. MetS is associated with an increased
      likelihood of CHD in stroke patients.

AB  - Converging lines of evidence suggest that abnormal accumulation of the kinase
      Polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2) might play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's
      disease (AD), possibly through its role in regulating the amyloid beta (Abeta)
      cascade. In the present study, we investigated the effect of inhibiting PLK2
      kinase activity in in vitro and in vivo models of AD neuropathology. First, we
      confirmed that PLK2 overexpression modulated APP and Tau protein levels and
      phosphorylation in cell culture, in a kinase activity dependent manner.
      Furthermore, a transient treatment of triple transgenic mouse model of AD
      (3xTg-AD) with a potent and specific PLK2 pharmacological inhibitor (PLK2i #37)
      reduced some neuropathological aspects in a sex-dependent manner. In 3xTg-AD
      males, treatment with PLK2i #37 led to lower Tau burden, higher synaptic protein 
      content, and prevented learning and memory deficits. In contrast, treated females
      showed an exacerbation of Tau pathology, associated with a reduction in amyloid
      plaque accumulation. Overall, our findings suggest that PLK2 inhibition alters
      key components of AD neuropathology in a sex-dependent manner and might display a
      therapeutic potential for the treatment for AD and related dementia.

AB  - Three decades of research, both in vitro and in vivo, have demonstrated the

      (Abeta) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Understanding the distinct properties
      between Abeta conformations and how conformation may impact cellular activity
      remain open questions, yet still continue to provide new insights into protein
      misfolding and aggregation. In particular, there is interest in the group of
      soluble oligomeric prefibrillar Abeta species comprising lower molecular weight
      oligomers up to larger protofibrils. In the current study, a number of strategies
      were utilized to separate Abeta protofibrils and oligomers and show that the
      smaller Abeta oligomers have a much different conformation than Abeta
      protofibrils. The differences were consistent for both Abeta40 and Abeta42.
      Protofibrils bound thioflavin T to a greater extent than oligomers, and were
      highly enriched in beta-sheet secondary structure. Abeta oligomers possessed a
      more open structure with significant solvent exposure of hydrophobic domains as
      determined by tryptophan fluorescence and bis-ANS binding, respectively. The
      protofibril-selective antibody AbSL readily discerned conformational differences 
      between protofibrils and oligomers. The more developed structure for Abeta
      protofibrils ultimately proved critical for provoking the release of tumor
      necrosis factor alpha from microglial cells. The findings demonstrated a
      dependency on beta-sheet structure for soluble Abeta aggregates to cause a
      microglial inflammatory response. The Abeta aggregation process yields many
      conformationally-varied species with different levels of beta-structure and
      exposed hydrophobicity. The conformation elements likely determine biological
      activity and pathogenicity.

AB  - To investigate the effects of household income level on all-cause mortality in
      patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Data was obtained from 7,937 participants
      in the Korean National Health Insurance cohort who was newly diagnosed with
      Alzheimer's disease using the anti-dementia medication between 2003 and 2013. All
      individuals were followed-up until December 2013 or death, whichever came first. 
      Individual income was estimated from the national health insurance premium.
      Information on mortality was obtained from the Korean National Statistical
      Office. Cox proportional hazard models were used to compare mortality rates
      between different income groups after adjusting for possible confounding risk
      factors. Of 7937 participants, 2292 AD patients (28.9%) died. Those with low,
      middle-low, middle income level were likely to have more increasing risk of
      mortality (HR 1.142 [1.022-1.276], HR 1.211 [1.045-1.402], and HR 1.158
      [1.009-1.328], respectively), compared to those with high income level. The
      findings of this study indicate that AD patients with low income level have
      higher risk for mortality. Promotion of targeted policies and priority support
      for these groups may help reduce the mortality rate in this vulnerable group.

      Alzheimer's disease in a multigenerational Colombian Family.
PG  - e0269955
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0269955 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly,
      affecting over 50 million people worldwide in 2020 and this number will triple to
      152 million by 2050. Much of the increase will be in developing countries like
      Colombia. In familial forms, highly penetrant mutations have been identified in
      three genes, APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2, supporting a role for amyloid-beta peptide.
      In sporadic forms, more than 30 risk genes involved in the lipid metabolism, the 
      immune system, and synaptic functioning mechanisms. We used whole-exome
      sequencing (WES) to evaluate a family of 97 members, spanning three generations, 
      with a familiar AD, and without mutations in APP, PSEN1, or PSEN2. We sequenced
      two affected and one unaffected member with the aim of identifying genetic
      variants that could explain the presence of the disease in the family and the
      candidate variants were validated in eleven members. We also built a structural
      model to try to determine the effect on protein function. WES analysis identified
      two rare variants in SORL1 and MTHFD1L genes segregating in the family with other
      potential risk variants in APOE, ABCA7, and CHAT, suggesting an oligogenic
      inheritance. Additionally, the structural 3D models of SORL1 and MTHFD1L variants
      shows that these variants produce polarity changes that favor hydrophobic
      interactions, resulting in local structural changes that could affect the protein
      function and may contribute to the development of the disease in this family.

AB  - The care of a patient with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is considered from the
      perspective of an ecosystem, that is, a systemic approach describing effective
      partnership, collaboration and research aimed at creating value, involving all
      participants in the AD patient journey. The effectiveness of this ecosystem is
      only possible with the involvement of all stakeholders in its development,
      including patients, healthcare professionals at all levels, government agencies, 
      private companies, and patient organizations. The unmet health care and
      information needs of patients with AD are a consequence of barriers in the AD
      ecosystem. Key barriers for the patient include low awareness and stigmatization 
      of the disease in society, lack of quality epidemiological data, difficulties in 
      timely diagnosis, lack of prevention programs, unpreparedness of most physicians 
      to conduct AD patient rehabilitation, and other factors. Based on the analysis of
      the ecosystem of AD and the patient pathway, 10 main directions (strategies)
      necessary for the formation of the ecosystem were identified: conducting research
      in the diagnosis and epidemiology of AD, creating and implementing a cognitive
      health program, forming a legal framework, raising public awareness, optimizing
      patient routing for timely diagnosis, organizing a network of memory
      clinics/laboratories, creating a register of patients with dementia, developing
      digital solutions and supporting social projects.

TI  - Identifying the regional substrates predictive of Alzheimer's disease progression
      through a convolutional neural network model and occlusion.
LID - 10.1002/hbm.26026 [doi]
AB  - Progressive brain atrophy is a key neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer's
      disease (AD) dementia. However, atrophy patterns along the progression of AD
      dementia are diffuse and variable and are often missed by univariate methods.
      Consequently, identifying the major regional atrophy patterns underlying AD
      dementia progression is challenging. In the current study, we propose a method
      that evaluates the degree to which specific regional atrophy patterns are
      predictive of AD dementia progression, while holding all other atrophy changes
      constant using a total sample of 334 subjects. We first trained a dense
      convolutional neural network model to differentiate individuals with mild
      cognitive impairment (MCI) who progress to AD dementia versus those with a stable
      MCI diagnosis. Then, we retested the model multiple times, each time occluding
      different regions of interest (ROIs) from the model's testing set's input. We
      also validated this approach by occluding ROIs based on Braak's staging scheme.
      We found that the hippocampus, fusiform, and inferior temporal gyri were the
      strongest predictors of AD dementia progression, in agreement with established
      staging models. We also found that occlusion of limbic ROIs defined according to 
      Braak stage III had the largest impact on the performance of the model. Our
      predictive model reveals the major regional patterns of atrophy predictive of AD 
      dementia progression. These results highlight the potential for early diagnosis
      and stratification of individuals with prodromal AD dementia based on patterns of
      cortical atrophy, prior to interventional clinical trials.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder strongly associates with
      aging. While amyloid plagues and neurofibrillary tangles are pathological
      hallmarks of AD, recent evidence suggests synaptic dysfunction and physical loss 
      may be the key mechanisms that determine the clinical syndrome and dementia
      onset. Currently, no effective therapy prevents neuropathological changes and
      cognitive decline. Neurotrophic factors and their receptors represent novel
      therapeutic targets to treat AD and dementia. Recent clinical literature revealed
      that MET receptor tyrosine kinase protein is reduced in AD patient's brain.
      Activation of MET by its ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) initiates
      pleiotropic signaling in the developing brain that promotes neurogenesis,
      survival, synaptogenesis, and plasticity. We hypothesize that if reduced MET
      signaling plays a role in AD pathogenesis, this might be reflected in the AD
      mouse models and as such provides opportunities for mechanistic studies on the
      role of HGF/MET in AD. Examining the 5XFAD mouse model revealed that MET protein 
      exhibits age-dependent progressive reduction prior to overt neuronal pathology,
      which cannot be explained by indiscriminate loss of total synaptic proteins. In
      addition, genetic ablation of MET protein in cortical excitatory neurons
      exacerbates amyloid-related neuropathology in 5XFAD mice. We further found that
      HGF enhances prefrontal layer 5 neuron synaptic plasticity measured by long-term 
      potentiation (LTP). However, the degree of LTP enhancement is significantly
      reduced in 5XFAD mice brain slices. Taken together, our study revealed that early
      reduction of HGF/MET signaling may contribute to the synaptic pathology observed 
      in AD.

AB  - Introduction: The current field of research on the impact of COVID-19 on mental
      health was mostly limited to the evaluation of the first round of the epidemic,
      few reports focused on the impact of the re-emergence of COVID-19. This study
      aimed to investigate the mental health literacy and status of residents during
      the re-outbreak of COVID-19 in China. Methods: The basic information sheet,
      health literacy survey scale, physical health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9),
      generalized anxiety disorder-7 (GAD-7), insomnia severity index (ISI), and
      Alzheimer dementia 8 (AD8) were applied to evaluate the mental health literacy,
      mental health status and elderly cognitive function, and chi2 test was applied
      for analysis of the difference between different groups. Results: A total of
      2,306 participants were involved in this study, of which 734 people completed the
      mental health literacy survey. The qualified rate of mental health literacy was
      6.4%. The difference is statistically significant. A total of 1,015 people
      completed the survey of mental health status, the prevalence of depressive
      symptoms was 8.87%, the monthly income of different families (chi2 = 13.96, P =
      0.01), the self-assessed health status (chi2 = 128.56, P < 0.05), the presence or
      absence of chronic diseases (chi2 = 4.78, P = 0.03), among all which the
      difference was statistically significant; the prevalence of anxiety symptoms was 
      3.84%, different regions (chi2 = 12.26, P < 0.05), occupations (chi2 = 11.65, P <
      0.05), household monthly income (chi2 = 12.65, P = 0.01), self-rated health
      status (chi2 = 151.11, P < 0.05), and chronic diseases (chi2 = 7.77, P = 0.01),
      among all which the differences were statistically significant. The prevalence of
      insomnia symptoms was 7.98%, different age (chi2 = 18.45, P < 0.05), region (chi2
      = 5.11, P = 0.02), monthly household income (chi2 = 12.68 P = 0.01), and
      self-assessed health status (chi2 = 91.71, P < 0.05), in which there was a
      statistically significant difference between those with or without chronic
      diseases (chi2 = 3 3.25, P < 0.05). A total of 557 elderly people over 65 years
      old completed the cognitive dysfunction screening, in which the prevalence of
      cognitive dysfunction was 17.41%, and the difference was statistically
      significant at the different self-assessed health status (chi2 = 96.24, P < 0.05)
      and with or without chronic diseases (chi2 = 107.09, P < 0.05). Conclusion: The
      mental health literacy and status of residents have not improved significantly
      during the second outbreak of the epidemic, indicating that under the
      normalization of epidemic prevention and control, more attention should be paid
      to the mental health of residents, and targeted health education and
      psychological intervention should be carried out to avoid relative adverse
      events.

AB  - Proteomics studies have shown differential expression of numerous proteins in
      dementias but have rarely led to novel biomarker tests for clinical use. The
      Marie Curie MIRIADE project is designed to experimentally evaluate development
      strategies to accelerate the validation and ultimate implementation of novel
      biomarkers in clinical practice, using proteomics-based biomarker development for
      main dementias as experimental case studies. We address several knowledge gaps
      that have been identified in the field. First, there is the
      technology-translation gap of different technologies for the discovery (e.g.,
      mass spectrometry) and the large-scale validation (e.g., immunoassays) of
      biomarkers. In addition, there is a limited understanding of conformational
      states of biomarker proteins in different matrices, which affect the selection of
      reagents for assay development. In this review, we aim to understand the
      decisions taken in the initial steps of biomarker development, which is done via 
      an interim narrative update of the work of each ESR subproject. The results
      describe the decision process to shortlist biomarkers from a proteomics to
      develop immunoassays or mass spectrometry assays for Alzheimer's disease, Lewy
      body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia. In addition, we explain the approach 
      to prepare the market implementation of novel biomarkers and assays. Moreover, we
      describe the development of computational protein state and interaction
      prediction models to support biomarker development, such as the prediction of
      epitopes. Lastly, we reflect upon activities involved in the biomarker
      development process to deduce a best-practice roadmap for biomarker development.

AB  - Objective: Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a neurological condition
      characterized by a clinical triad of gait disturbance, cognitive impairment, and 
      urinary incontinence in conjunction with ventriculomegaly. Other
      neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and
      vascular dementia share some overlapping clinical features. However, there is
      evidence that patients with comorbid NPH and Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease
      may still exhibit good clinical response after CSF diversion. This study aims to 
      evaluate clinical responses after ventriculo-peritoneal shunt (VPS) in a cohort
      of patients with coexisting NPH and neurodegenerative disease. Methods: The study
      has two components; (i) a pilot study was performed that specifically focused
      upon patients with Complex NPH and following the inclusion of the Complex NPH
      subtype into consideration for the clinical NPH programme, (ii) a retrospective
      snapshot study was performed to confirm and characterize differences between
      Classic and Complex NPH patients being seen consecutively over the course of 1
      year within a working subspecialist NPH clinic. We studied the characteristics of
      patients with Complex NPH, utilizing clinical risk stratification and multimodal 
      biomarkers. Results: There was no significant difference between responders and
      non-responders to CSF diversion on comorbidity scales. After VPS insertion,
      significantly more Classic NPH patients had improved cognition compared to
      Complex NPH patients (p = 0.005). Improvement in gait and urinary symptoms did
      not differ between the groups. 26% of the Classic NPH group showed global
      improvement of the triad, and 42% improved in two domains. Although only 8%
      showed global improvement of the triad, all Complex NPH patients improved in
      gait. Conclusions: Our study has demonstrated that the presence of
      neurodegenerative disorders co-existing with NPH should not be the sole barrier
      to the consideration of high-volume tap test or lumbar drainage via a specialist 
      NPH programme. Further characterization of distinct cohorts of NPH with differing
      degrees of CSF responsiveness due to overlay from neurodegenerative or
      comorbidity risk burden may aid toward more precise prognostication and treatment
      strategies. We propose a simplistic conceptual framework to describe NPH by its
      Classic vs. Complex subtypes to promote the clinical paradigm shift toward
      subspecialist geriatric neurosurgery by addressing needs for rapid screening
      tools at the clinical-research interface.

AB  - Evidence from previous epidemiological studies on the effect of physical activity
      on the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is conflicting. We performed a two-sample
      Mendelian randomization analysis to verify whether physical activity is causally 
      associated with AD. This study used two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR)
      analysis to estimate the association between physical activity (including overall
      activity, sedentary behavior, walking, and moderate-intensity activity) and AD.
      Genetic instruments for physical activity were obtained from published
      genome-wide association studies (GWAS) including 91,105 individuals from UK
      Biobank. Summary-level GWAS data were extracted from the International Genomics
      of Alzheimer's Project IGAP (21,982 patients with AD and 41,944 controls).
      Inverse Variance Weighted (IVW) was used to estimate the effect of physical
      activity on AD. Sensitivity analyses including weighted median, MR-Egger,
      MR-PRESSO, and leave-one-out analysis were used to estimate pleiotropy and
      heterogeneity. Mendelian randomization evidences suggested a protective
      relationship between walking and AD (odds ratio (OR) = 0.30, 95% confidence
      interval (CI), 0.13-0.68, P = 0.0039). Genetically predicted overall activity,
      sedentary behavior, and moderate-intensity activity were not associated with AD. 
      In summary, this study provided evidence that genetically predicted walking might
      associate with a reduced risk of AD. Further research into the causal association
      between physical activity and AD could help to explore the real relationship and 
      provide more measures to reduce AD risk.

      ameliorates symptoms and pathologies of Alzheimer disease model mice by

AB  - There is a compelling need to develop disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer's
      disease (AD), the most common neuro-degenerative disorder. Together with recent
      progress in vector development for efficiently targeting the central nervous
      system, gene therapy has been suggested as a potential therapeutic modality to
      overcome the limited delivery of conventional types of drugs to and within the
      damaged brain. In addition, given increasing evidence of the strong link between 
      glia and AD pathophysiology, therapeutic targets have been moving toward those
      addressing glial cell pathology. Nurr1 and Foxa2 are transcription/epigenetic
      regulators that have been reported to cooperatively regulate inflammatory and
      neurotrophic response in glial cells. In this study, we tested the therapeutic
      potential of Nurr1 and Foxa2 gene delivery to treat AD symptoms and pathologies. 
      A series of functional, histologic, and transcriptome analyses revealed that the 
      combined expression of Nurr1 and Foxa2 substantially ameliorated AD-associated
      amyloid beta and Tau proteinopathy, cell senescence, synaptic loss, and
      neuro-inflammation in multiple in vitro and in vivo AD models. Intra-cranial
      delivery of Nurr1 and Foxa2 genes using adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype 9
      improved the memory and cognitive function of AD model mice. The therapeutic
      benefits of gene delivery were attained mainly by correcting pathologic glial
      function. These findings collectively indicate that AAV9-mediated Nurr1 and Foxa2
      gene transfer could be an effective disease-modifying therapy for AD.

AB  - Depressed individuals are twice as likely to develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) as 
      compared to controls. Brain amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition is believed to have a
      major role in AD pathogenesis but studies also suggest associations of Abeta
      dynamics and depression. The aim of this study was to test if plasma Abeta levels
      are longitudinally associated to late-life depression. We measured plasma levels 
      of amyloid-beta1-40 (Abeta40) and amyloid-beta1-42 (Abeta42) peptides
      longitudinally for three consecutive years in 48 cognitively intact elderly
      subjects with late-life major depressive disorder (LLMD) and 45 age-matched
      cognitively healthy controls. We found that the Abeta42/Abeta40 plasma ratio was 
      significantly and steadily lower in depressed subjects compared to controls (p < 
      0.001). At screening, Abeta42/Abeta40 plasma did not correlate with depression
      severity (as measured with Hamilton Depression Scale) or cognitive performance
      (as measured with Mini-Mental State Examination) but was associated to depression
      severity at 3 years after adjustment for age, education, cognitive performance,
      and antidepressants use. This study showed that reduced plasma Abeta42/Abeta40
      ratio is consistently associated with LLMD diagnosis and that increased severity 
      of depression at baseline predicted low Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio at 3 years. Future 
      studies are needed to confirm these findings and examine if the consistently
      lower plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio in LLMD reflects increased brain amyloid
      deposition, as observed in AD subjects, and an increased risk for progressive
      cognitive decline and AD.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disease with insidious onset and
      progressive progression, is the main type of dementia. Currently, there is no
      specific cure for the disease. At the same time, a series of drug developments
      based on the classic theory, the Abeta cascade hypothesis, have not completed
      phase III clinical trials, challenging the hypothesis. Polysaccharides obtained
      from natural products can be used in the treatment of AD, which has attracted
      academic attention due to its advantages of multi-target, multi-channel, no or
      modest side effects. The TCM syndrome type of AD is mainly "qi and blood
      deficiency, kidney essence deficiency", and the medicine is mainly used to
      replenish qi and blood, kidney and bone marrow. Thus, there has been extensive
      and in-depth research on polysaccharides obtained from tonic Chinese herbal
      medicine in China. Based on this background, this paper evaluated the effects and
      mechanisms of natural polysaccharides on AD by combing and screening English and 
      related literature in recent 5 years and summarized the extraction process and
      structure-activity relationship of polysaccharides.

AB  - Tau-specific immunotherapy is an attractive strategy for the treatment of
      Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies. However, effectively targeting tau in 
      the brain remains a considerable challenge due to the restrictive nature of the
      blood-brain barrier (BBB), which excludes an estimated >99% of peripherally
      administered antibodies. However, their transport across the BBB can be
      facilitated by a novel modality, low-intensity scanning ultrasound used in
      combination with intravenously injected microbubbles (SUS(+MB)). We have
      previously shown that SUS(+MB)-mediated delivery of a tau-specific antibody in a 
      single-chain (scFv) format to tau transgenic mice enhanced brain and neuronal
      uptake and subsequently, reduced tau pathology and improved behavioural outcomes 
      to a larger extent than either scFv or SUS(+MB) on its own. Here we generated a
      novel tau-specific monoclonal antibody, RNF5, and validated it in its IgG format 
      in the presence or absence of SUS(+MB) by treating K369I tau transgenic K3 mice
      once weekly for 12 weeks. We found that both RNF5 and SUS(+MB) treatments on
      their own significantly reduced tau pathology. In the combination group (RNF5 +
      SUS(+MB)), however, despite increased antibody localization in the brain, there
      were no further reductions in tau pathology when compared to RNF5 treatment
      alone. Furthermore, following SUS(+MB), RNF5 accumulated heavily within cells
      across the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus, that were negative for MAP2
      and p-tau, suggesting that SUS(+MB) may not facilitate enhanced RNF5 engagement
      of intraneuronal tau. Overall, our new findings reveal the complexities of
      combining tau immunotherapy with SUS(+MB) and challenge the view that this is a
      straight-forward approach.

TI  - Does the imbalance in the apolipoprotein E isoforms underlie the
      pathophysiological process of sporadic Alzheimer's disease?
LID - 10.1002/alz.12728 [doi]
AB  - Human apolipoprotein E (apoE) is a 299-amino acid secreted glycoprotein binding
      cholesterol and phospholipids, and with three common isoforms (APOE epsilon2,
      APOE epsilon3, and APOE epsilon4). The exact mechanism by which APOE gene
      variants increase/decrease Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk is not fully understood,
      but APOE isoforms differently affect brain homeostasis and neuroinflammation,
      blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, glial function, synaptogenesis, oral/gut 
      microbiota, neural networks, amyloid beta (Abeta) deposition, and tau-mediated
      neurodegeneration. In this perspective, we propose a comprehensive interpretation
      of APOE-mediated effects within AD pathophysiology, describing some specific
      cellular, biochemical, and epigenetic mechanisms and updating the different
      APOE-targeting approaches being developed as potential AD therapies.
      Intracisternal adeno-associated viral-mediated delivery of APOE epsilon2 is being
      tested in AD APOE epsilon4/epsilon4 carriers, while APOE mimetics are being used 
      in subjects with perioperative neurocognitive disorders. Other approaches
      including APOE epsilon4 antisense oligonucleotides, anti-APOE epsilon4 monoclonal
      antibodies, APOE epsilon4 structure correctors, and APOE-Abeta interaction
      inhibitors produced positive results in transgenic AD mouse models.

TI  - ATP-independent molecular chaperone activity generated under reducing conditions.
PG  - e4378
LID - 10.1002/pro.4378 [doi]
AB  - Molecular chaperones are essential to maintain proteostasis. While the functions 
      of intracellular molecular chaperones that oversee protein synthesis, folding and
      aggregation, are established, those specialized to work in the extracellular
      environment are less understood. Extracellular proteins reside in a considerably 
      more oxidizing milieu than cytoplasmic proteins and are stabilized by abundant
      disulfide bonds. Hence, extracellular proteins are potentially destabilized and
      sensitive to aggregation under reducing conditions. We combine biochemical and
      mass spectrometry experiments and elucidate that the molecular chaperone
      functions of the extracellular protein domain Bri2 BRICHOS only appear under
      reducing conditions, through the assembly of monomers into large polydisperse
      oligomers by an intra- to intermolecular disulfide bond relay mechanism.
      Chaperone-active assemblies of the Bri2 BRICHOS domain are efficiently generated 
      by physiological thiol-containing compounds and proteins, and appear in parallel 
      with reduction-induced aggregation of extracellular proteins. Our results give
      insights into how potent chaperone activity can be generated from inactive
      precursors under conditions that are destabilizing to most extracellular proteins
      and thereby support protein stability/folding in the extracellular space.
      SIGNIFICANCE: Chaperones are essential to cells as they counteract toxic
      consequences of protein misfolding particularly under stress conditions. Our work
      describes a novel activation mechanism of an extracellular molecular chaperone
      domain, called Bri2 BRICHOS. This mechanism is based on reducing conditions that 
      initiate small subunits to assemble into large oligomers via a disulfide relay
      mechanism. Activated Bri2 BRICHOS inhibits reduction-induced aggregation of
      extracellular proteins and could be a means to boost proteostasis in the
      extracellular environment upon reductive stress.

AB  - Age-related difficulties and quarantine restrictions impede the possibilities to 
      maintain contact with one's social network. Maintaining these contacts may be
      supported by digital games. To develop effective and feasible digital tools to
      foster social interaction, we aimed to explore what older adults find important
      in social contact and what barriers and enablers they foresee in digital gaming
      interventions as network support aids. Two focus groups and 20 semi-structured
      interviews (N = 29) with older adults (aged 55-87) were held to explore the
      research questions. Furthermore, a questionnaire was administered (N = 29)
      containing measures of loneliness, frailty, and social network size. Participants
      found 'reciprocity', 'in-person contact', and 'personal connection' important in 
      contact with strong ties. Online games were not used much for socializing but may
      be used in the future, particularly by less mobile older adults. Future social
      gaming interventions should be challenging, user-friendly, and offer the
      possibility to communicate. Digital co-designed interventions that are feasible, 
      challenging, intuitive, and trigger meaningful communication may strengthen
      social interactions in older adults. They may be a relevant social support tool
      in periods of interaction limitations due to functional impairment or social
      isolation.

PG  - 68-78

AB  - BACKGROUND: A simultaneous administration of an acetylcholinesterase (AChE)
      inhibitor and a NSAID as a drug cocktail has been documented to exhibit
      significantly protective effects in AD patients. But it suffers from poor patent 
      compliance, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic issues. OBJECTIVE: The present
      study is aimed to design and synthesize a hybrid molecule capable of exhibiting
      both AChE inhibition and anti-inflammatory activities for de-accelerating the
      progression of AD. The synthesized molecules will be evaluated for in vitro and
      in vivo models. METHODS: The present study involves the coupling of ibuprofen or 
      naproxen to varied disubstituted amines (AChE inhibitor pharmacophore) through
      benzimidazole to develop two series of compounds i.e. IB01-IB05 and NP01-NP05.
      The synthesized compounds were characterized using FTIR, (1)H-NMR, (13)C-NMR and 
      MS. All compounds were evaluated for in vitro AChE inhibitory and COX inhibitory 
      activities. The most active compound was taken for in vivo evaluation. RESULTS:
      Compounds of series IB01-IB05 are found more potent as compared to NP01-NP05. The
      maximally potent compound IB04 in in vitro evaluation is selected for in vivo
      evaluation of memory restoration activity using scopolamine-induced amnesia model
      in mice. It significantly reverses the scopolamine-induced changes (i.e., escape 
      latency time, mean time spent in target quadrant, brain AChE activity and
      oxidative stress) in a dose-dependent manner. IB04 at 8 mg/kg is significantly
      effective in lowering AD manifestation in comparison to donepezil. CONCLUSION:
      The findings indicate that Benzimidazole hybrids utilizing ibuprofen and
      pyrrolidine moiety may prove a useful template for the development of new
      chemical moieties against AD with multiple potencies.

TI  - Rapid olfactory decline during aging predicts dementia and GMV loss in AD brain
      regions.
LID - 10.1002/alz.12717 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Longitudinal multivariable analyses are needed to determine if the 
      rate of olfactory decline during normal cognition predicts subsequent Alzheimer's
      disease (AD) diagnoses and brain dysmorphology. METHODS: Older adults (n = 515)
      were assessed annually for odor identification, cognitive function and dementia
      clinical diagnosis (max follow-up 18 years). Regional gray matter volumes (GMV)
      were quantified (3T MRI) in a cross-sectional subsample (n = 121). Regression
      models were adjusted for APOE-epsilon4 genotype, dementia risk factors and
      demographics. RESULTS: Faster olfactory decline during periods of normal
      cognition predicted higher incidence of subsequent MCI or dementia (OR 1.89, 95% 
      CI: 1.26, 2.90, p < 0.01; comparable to carrying an APOE-epsilon4 allele) and
      smaller GMV in AD and olfactory regions (beta = -0.11, 95% CI -0.21, -0.00).
      DISCUSSION: Rapid olfactory decline during normal cognition, using repeated
      olfactory measurement, predicted subsequent cognitive impairment, dementia, and
      smaller GMVs, highlighting its potential as a simple biomarker for early AD
      detection. HIGHLIGHTS: Rate of olfactory decline was calculated from olfactory
      testing over >/=3 time points. Rapid olfactory decline predicted impaired
      cognition and higher risk of dementia. Neurodegeneration on 3T magnetic resonance
      imaging was identical in those with olfactory decline and Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Novel scaffolds are expected to treat Alzheimer's disease,
      pyrazole-5-fluorosulfates were found as selective BuChE inhibitors. Compounds
      K1-K26 were assayed for ChE inhibitory activity, amongst them, compound K3 showed
      potent BuChE and hBuChE inhibition (IC50 = 0.79 muM and 6.59 muM). SAR analysis
      showed that 1-, 3-, 4-subtituent and 5-fluorosulfate of pyrazole ring affected
      BuChE inhibitory activity. Molecular docking showed that the fluorosulfate
      increased the binding affinity of hBuChE through pi-sulphur interaction. Compound
      K3 was a reversible, mixed and non-competitive BuChE inhibitor (Ki = 0.77 muM)
      and showed remarkable neuroprotection, safe toxicological profile and BBB
      penetration. In vivo behavioural study showed that K3 treatment improved the
      Abeta1 - 42-induced cognitive impairment, and significantly prevented the effects
      of Abeta1 - 42 toxicity. Therefore, selective BuChE inhibitor K3 has potential to
      be further developed as AD therapeutics.

TI  - Modulation of Brain Activity and Functional Connectivity by Acupuncture Combined 
      With Donepezil on Mild-to-Moderate Alzheimer's Disease: A Neuroimaging Pilot
      Study.
PG  - 912923
LID - 10.3389/fneur.2022.912923 [doi]
AB  - Background: Functional brain imaging changes have been proven as potential
      pathophysiological targets in early-stage AD. Current longitudinal neuroimaging
      studies of AD treated by acupuncture, which is one of the growingly acknowledged 
      non-pharmacological interventions, have neither adopted comprehensive acupuncture
      protocols, nor explored the changes after a complete treatment duration. Thus,
      the mechanisms of acupuncture effects remain not fully investigated. Objective:
      This study aimed to investigate the changes in spontaneous brain activity and
      functional connectivity and provide evidence for central mechanism of a 12-week
      acupuncture program on mild-to-moderate AD. Methods: A total of forty-four
      patients with mild-to-moderate AD and twenty-two age- and education-level-matched
      healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. The forty-four patients with AD
      received a 12-week intervention of either acupuncture combined with Donepezil
      (the treatment group) or Donepezil alone (the control group). The two groups
      received two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans before and after 
      treatment. The healthy subject group underwent no intervention, and only one fMRI
      scan was performed after enrollment. The fractional amplitude of low-frequency
      fluctuation (fALFF) and functional connectivity (FC) were applied to analyze the 
      imaging data. The correlations between the imaging indicators and the changed
      score of Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Section (ADAS-cog) were
      also explored. Results: After the 12-week intervention, compared to those in the 
      control group, patients with AD in the treatment group scored significantly lower
      on ADAS-cog value. Moreover, compared to healthy subjects, the areas where the
      fALFF value decreased in patients with AD were mainly located in the right
      inferior temporal gyrus, middle/inferior frontal gyrus, middle occipital gyrus,
      left precuneus, and bilateral superior temporal gyrus. Compared with the control 
      group, the right precuneus demonstrated the greatest changed value of fALFF after
      the intervention in the treatment group. The difference in ADAS-cog after
      interventions was positively correlated with the difference in fALFF value in the
      left temporal lobe. Right precuneus-based FC analysis showed that the altered FC 
      by the treatment group compared to the control group was mainly located in the
      bilateral middle temporal gyrus. Conclusion: The study revealed the key role of
      precuneus in the effect of the combination of acupuncture and Donepezil on
      mild-to-moderate AD for cognitive function, as well as its connection with middle
      temporal gyrus, which provided a potential treating target for AD. Trial

AB  - The definitive diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) without the need for
      neuropathological confirmation remains a challenge in AD research today, despite 
      efforts to uncover the molecular and biological underpinnings of the disease
      process. Furthermore, the potential for therapeutic intervention is limited upon 
      the onset of symptoms, providing motivation for studying and treating the AD
      precursor mild cognitive impairment (MCI), the prodromal stage of AD instead.
      Applying machine learning classification to transcriptomic data of MCI, AD, and
      cognitively normal (CN) control patients, we identified differentially expressed 
      genes that serve as biomarkers for the characterization and classification of
      subjects into MCI or AD groups. Predictive models employing these biomarker genes
      exhibited good classification performances for CN, MCI, and AD, significantly
      above random chance. The PI3K-Akt, IL-17, JAK-STAT, TNF, and Ras signaling
      pathways were also enriched in these biomarker genes, indicating their diagnostic
      potential and pathophysiological roles in MCI and AD. These findings could aid in
      the recognition of MCI and AD risk in clinical settings, allow for the tracking
      of disease progression over time in individuals as part of a therapeutic
      approach, and provide possible personalized drug targets for early intervention
      of MCI and AD.

TI  - An Automated Approach for the Detection of Alzheimer's Disease From Resting State
      Electroencephalography.
PG  - 924547

AB  - Early detection is crucial to control the progression of Alzheimer's disease and 
      to postpone intellectual decline. Most current detection techniques are costly,
      inaccessible, or invasive. Furthermore, they require laborious analysis, what
      delays the start of medical treatment. To overcome this, researchers have
      recently investigated AD detection based on electroencephalography, a
      non-invasive neurophysiology technique, and machine learning algorithms. However,
      these approaches typically rely on manual procedures such as visual inspection,
      that requires additional personnel for the analysis, or on cumbersome EEG
      acquisition systems. In this paper, we performed a preliminary evaluation of a
      fully-automated approach for AD detection based on a commercial EEG acquisition
      system and an automated classification pipeline. For this purpose, we recorded
      the resting state brain activity of 26 participants from three groups: mild AD,
      mild cognitive impairment (MCI-non-AD), and healthy controls. First, we applied
      automated data-driven algorithms to reject EEG artifacts. Then, we obtained
      spectral, complexity, and entropy features from the preprocessed EEG segments.
      Finally, we assessed two binary classification problems: mild AD vs. controls,
      and MCI-non-AD vs. controls, through leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. The 
      preliminary results that we obtained are comparable to the best reported in
      literature, what suggests that AD detection could be automatically detected
      through automated processing and commercial EEG systems. This is promising, since
      it may potentially contribute to reducing costs related to AD screening, and to
      shortening detection times, what may help to advance medical treatment.

LID - 10.1093/braincomms/fcac182 [doi]
AB  - Traditional methods for detecting asymptomatic brain changes in neurodegenerative
      diseases such as Alzheimer's disease or frontotemporal degeneration typically
      evaluate changes in volume at a predefined level of granularity, e.g. voxel-wise 
      or in a priori defined cortical volumes of interest. Here, we apply a method
      based on hierarchical spectral clustering, a graph-based partitioning technique. 
      Our method uses multiple levels of segmentation for detecting changes in a
      data-driven, unbiased, comprehensive manner within a standard statistical
      framework. Furthermore, spectral clustering allows for detection of changes in
      shape along with changes in size. We performed tensor-based morphometry to detect
      changes in the Genetic Frontotemporal dementia Initiative asymptomatic and
      symptomatic frontotemporal degeneration mutation carriers using hierarchical
      spectral clustering and compared the outcome to that obtained with a more
      conventional voxel-wise tensor- and voxel-based morphometric analysis. In the
      symptomatic groups, the hierarchical spectral clustering-based method yielded
      results that were largely in line with those obtained with the voxel-wise
      approach. In asymptomatic C9orf72 expansion carriers, spectral clustering
      detected changes in size in medial temporal cortex that voxel-wise methods could 
      only detect in the symptomatic phase. Furthermore, in the asymptomatic and the
      symptomatic phases, the spectral clustering approach detected changes in shape in
      the premotor cortex in C9orf72. In summary, the present study shows the merit of 
      hierarchical spectral clustering for data-driven segmentation and detection of
      structural changes in the symptomatic and asymptomatic stages of monogenic
      frontotemporal degeneration.

AB  - Introduction: To address the need for remote assessments of cognitive decline and
      dementia, we developed and administered electronic versions of the Clinical
      Dementia Rating (CDR(R)) and the Financial Capacity Instrument-Short Form
      (FCI-SF) (F-CAP((R))), called the eCDR and eFCI, respectively. Methods: The CDR
      and FCI-SF were adapted for remote, unsupervised, online use based on item
      response analysis of the standard instruments. Participants completed the eCDR
      and eFCI first in clinic, and then at home within 2 weeks. Results: Of the 243
      enrolled participants, 179 (73%) cognitively unimpaired (CU), 50 (21%) with mild 
      cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia, and 14 (6%) with an unknown diagnosis,
      84% and 85% of them successfully completed the eCDR and eFCI, respectively, at
      home. Discussion: These results show initial feasibility in developing and
      administering online instruments to remotely assess and monitor cognitive decline
      along the CU to MCI/very mild dementia continuum. Validation is an important next
      step.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias are a global challenge. Early
      diagnosis is important to manage the disease. However, there are barriers to
      diagnosis that differ by region. Researchers from Brazil, China, Nigeria, Spain, 
      and Sweden have identified key barriers to AD diagnosis in their countries. In
      Brazil, socioeconomic inequalities and poor recognition of dementia by physicians
      can prevent diagnosis. In China, a very large population and lack of physician
      training in dementia make diagnosis problematic. In Nigeria, socioeconomic
      inequalities and cultural stigma can stand in the way of diagnosis. In Spain,
      patient hesitancy and an overloaded health-care system are barriers to diagnosis.
      In Sweden, inconsistent use of biomarkers is a prominent barrier to diagnosis of 
      AD. To support diagnosis, more focus is needed on education of patients and
      physicians, increased use of support services, and improved access to biomarkers 
      to accurately diagnose AD.

AB  - This study reviews recent literature on interoception directing decision-making
      in Alzheimer's disease (AD). According to the somatic marker hypothesis, signals 
      from the internal body direct decision-making and involve the ventromedial
      prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). After reviewing relevant studies, we summarize the
      brain areas related to interoception and decision-making (e.g., vmPFC,
      hippocampus, amygdala, hypothalamus, anterior cingulate cortex, and insular
      cortex) and their roles in and relationships with AD pathology. Moreover, we
      outline the relationship among interoception, the autonomic nervous system,
      endocrine system, and AD pathology. We discuss that impaired interoception leads 
      to decreased decision-making ability in people with AD from the perspective of
      brain neural underpinning. Additionally, we emphasize that anosognosia or reduced
      self-awareness and metacognition in AD are remarkably congruent with the
      malfunction of the autonomic nervous system regulating the interoceptive network.
      Furthermore, we propose that impaired interoception may contribute to a loss in
      the decision-making ability of patients with AD. However, there still exist
      empirical challenges in confirming this proposal. First, there has been no
      standardization for measuring or improving interoception to enhance
      decision-making ability in patients with AD. Future studies are required to
      better understand how AD pathology induces impairments in interoception and
      decision-making.

AB  - Research on the microbiome has drawn an increasing amount of attention over the
      past decade. Even more so for its association with disease. Neurodegenerative
      diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been a subject of study for a
      long time with slow success in improving diagnostic accuracy or identifying a
      possibility for treatment. In this work, we analyze past and current research on 
      microbiome and its positive impact on AD treatment and diagnosis. We present a
      bibliometric analysis from 2012 to 2021 with data retrieved on September 2, 2021,
      from the Scopus database. The query includes "Gut AND (Microbiota OR Microbiome) 
      AND Alzheimer*" within the article title, abstract, and keywords for all kinds of
      documents in the database. Compared with 2016, the number of publications (NPs)
      on the subject doubled by 2017. Moreover, we observe an exponential growth
      through 2020, and with the data presented, it is almost certain that it will
      continue this trend and grow even further in the upcoming years. We identify key 
      journals interested in the subject and discuss the articles with most citations, 
      analyzing trends and topics for future research, such as the ability to diagnose 
      the disease and complement the cognitive test with other clinical biomarkers.
      According to the test, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is normally considered an 
      initial stage for AD. This test, combined with the role of the gut microbiome in 
      early stages of the disease, may improve the diagnostic accuracy. Based on our
      findings, there is emerging evidence that microbiota, perhaps more specifically
      gut microbiota, plays a key role in the pathogenesis of diseases, such as AD.

TI  - Global and regional projections of the economic burden of Alzheimer's disease and
      related dementias from 2019 to 2050: A value of statistical life approach.
PG  - 101580
LID - 10.1016/j.eclinm.2022.101580 [doi]
AB  - Background: The burden of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs) is
      expected to grow rapidly with population aging, especially in low- and
      middle-income countries, in the next few decades. We used a willingness-to-pay
      approach to project the global, regional, and national economic burden of ADRDs
      from 2019 to 2050 under status quo. Methods: We projected age group and
      country-specific disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost to ADRDs in future
      years based on historical growth in disease burden and available population
      projections. We used country-specific extrapolations of the value of a
      statistical life (VSL) year and its future projections based on historical income
      growth to estimate the economic burden - measured in terms of the value of lost
      DALYs - of ADRDs. A probabilistic uncertainty analysis was used to calculate
      point estimates and 95% uncertainty bounds of the economic burden. Findings: In
      2019, the global VSL-based economic burden of ADRDs was an estimated $2.8
      trillion. The burden was projected to increase to $4.7 trillion (95% uncertainty 
      bound: $4 trillion-$5.5 trillion) in 2030, $8.5 trillion ($6.8 trillion-$10.8
      trillion) in 2040, and $16.9 trillion ($11.3 trillion-$27.3 trillion) in 2050.
      Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) would account for 65% of the global
      VSL-based economic burden in 2050, as compared with only 18% in 2019. Within
      LMICs, upper-middle income countries would carry the largest VSL-based economic
      burden by 2050 (92% of LMICs burden and 60% of global burden). Interpretation:
      ADRDs have a large and inequitable projected future VSL-based economic burden.

TI  - Boron Nitride Nanoparticles Loaded with a Boron-Based Hybrid as a Promising Drug 
      Carrier System for Alzheimer's Disease Treatment.
LID - 8249 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23158249 [doi]
AB  - The search for an innovative and effective drug delivery system that can carry
      and release targeted drugs with enhanced activity to treat Alzheimer's disease
      has received much attention in the last decade. In this study, we first designed 
      a boron-based drug delivery system for effective treatment of AD by integrating
      the folic acid (FA) functional group into hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)
      nanoparticles (NPs) through an esterification reaction. The hBN-FA drug carrier
      system was assembled with a new drug candidate and a novel boron-based hybrid
      containing an antioxidant as BLA, to constitute a self-assembled AD nano
      transport system. We performed molecular characterization analyses by using
      UV-vis spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer (FTIR),
      scanning electron microscope (SEM), Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS)
      and Zeta potential investigations. Second, we tested the anti-Alzheimer
      properties of the carrier system on a differentiated neuroblastoma (SHSY5-Y) cell
      line, which was exposed to beta-amyloid (1-42) peptides to stimulate an
      experimental in vitro AD model. Next, we performed cytotoxicity analyses of
      synthesized molecules on the human dermal fibroblast cell line (HDFa) and the
      experimental AD model. Cytotoxicity analyses showed that even higher
      concentrations of the carrier system did not enhance the toxicological outcome in
      HDFa cells. Drug loading analyses reported that uncoated hBN nano conjugate could
      not load the BLA, whereas the memantine loading capacity of hBN was 84.3%. On the
      other hand, memantine and the BLA loading capacity of the hBN-FA construct was
      found to be 95% and 97.5%, respectively. Finally, we investigated the
      neuroprotective properties of the nano carrier systems in the experimental AD
      model. According to the results, 25 microg/mL concentrations of hBN-FA+memantine 
      (94% cell viability) and hBN-FA+BLA (99% cell viability) showed ameliorative
      properties against beta-amyloid (1-42) peptide toxicity (50% cell viability).
      These results were generated through the use of flow cytometry,
      acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and antioxidant assays. In conclusion, the developed 
      drug carrier system for AD treatment showed promising potential for further
      investigations and enlightened neuroprotective capabilities of boron molecules to
      treat AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. On the other hand, enzyme
      activity, systematic toxicity analyses, and animal studies should be performed to
      understand neuroprotective properties of the designed carrier system
      comprehensively.

LID - 8209 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23158209 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial pathology characterized by
      beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposits, Tau hyperphosphorylation, neuroinflammatory
      response, and cognitive deficit. Changes in the bacterial gut microbiota (BGM)
      have been reported as a possible etiological factor of AD. We assessed in
      offspring (F1) 3xTg, the effect of BGM dysbiosisdysbiosis in mothers (F0) at
      gestation and F1 from lactation up to the age of 5 months on Abeta and Tau levels
      in the hippocampus, as well as on spatial memory at the early symptomatic stage
      of AD. We found that BGM dysbiosisdysbiosis with antibiotics (Abx) treatment in
      F0 was vertically transferred to their F1 3xTg mice, as observed on postnatal day
      (PD) 30 and 150. On PD150, we observed a delay in spatial memory impairment and
      Abeta deposits, but not in Tau and pTau protein in the hippocampus at the early
      symptomatic stage of AD. These effects are correlated with relative abundance of 
      bacteria and alpha diversity, and are specific to bacterial consortia. Our
      results suggest that this specific BGM could reduce neuroinflammatory responses
      related to cerebral amyloidosis and cognitive deficit and activate metabolic
      pathways associated with the biosynthesis of triggering or protective molecules
      for AD.

LID - 10.3390/ijms23158144 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by memory
      impairment in patients. Erythropoietin (EPO) has been reported to stimulate
      neurogenesis. This study was conducted to determine the regenerative effects of
      EPO in an AD model and to assess its underlying mechanism. Recombinant human EPO 
      was intraperitoneally administered to AD mice induced by intracerebroventricular 
      Abeta oligomer injection. Behavioral assessments with novel object recognition
      test and passive avoidance task showed improvement in memory function of the
      EPO-treated AD mice compared to that of the saline-treated AD mice (p &lt;
      0.0001). An in vivo protein assay for the hippocampus and cortex tissue indicated
      that EPO treatment modulated neurotransmitters, including dopamine, serotonin,
      and adrenaline. EPO treatment also restored the activity of serotonin receptors, 
      including 5-HT4R, 5-HT7R, and 5-HT1aR (p &lt; 0.01), at mRNA levels. Furthermore,
      EPO seemed to exert an anti-inflammatory influence by downregulating TLR4 at mRNA
      and protein levels (p &lt; 0.05). Finally, an immunohistochemical assay revealed 
      increments of Nestin(+) and NeuN(+) neuronal cells in the CA3 region in the
      EPO-treated AD mice compared to those in the saline-treated AD mice. The
      conclusion is that EPO administration might be therapeutic for AD by activating
      the serotonergic pathway, anti-inflammatory action, and neurogenic
      characteristics.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is considered the most prevalent neurodegenerative
      disease and the leading cause of dementia worldwide. Sphingolipids, such as
      ceramide or sphingosine 1-phosphate, are bioactive molecules implicated in
      structural and signaling functions. Metabolic dysfunction in the highly conserved
      pathways to produce sphingolipids may lead to or be a consequence of an
      underlying disease. Recent studies on transcriptomics and sphingolipidomics have 
      observed alterations in sphingolipid metabolism of both enzymes and metabolites
      involved in their synthesis in several neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. 
      In this review, we highlight the most relevant findings related to ceramide and
      neurodegeneration, with a special focus on AD.

TI  - Evaluation of tau deposition using (18)F-PI-2620 PET in MCI and early AD
      subjects-a MissionAD tau sub-study.
PG  - 105
LID - 10.1186/s13195-022-01048-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The ability of (18)F-PI-2620 PET to measure the spatial distribution 
      of tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been demonstrated in previous
      studies. The objective of this work was to evaluate tau deposition using
      (18)F-PI-2620 PET in beta-amyloid positive subjects with a diagnosis of mild
      cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild AD dementia and characterize it with respect
      to amyloid deposition, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) assessment, hippocampal volume, 
      and cognition. METHODS: Subjects with a diagnosis of MCI due to AD or mild AD
      dementia and a visually amyloid-positive (18)F-florbetaben PET scan (n=74, 76 +/-
      7 years, 38 females) underwent a baseline (18)F-PI-2620 PET, T1-weighted magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI), CSF assessment (Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio, p-tau, t-tau)
      (n=22) and several cognitive tests. A 1-year follow-up (18)F-PI-2620 PET scans
      and cognitive assessments were done in 15 subjects. RESULTS: Percentage of
      visually tau-positive scans increased with amyloid-beta deposition measured in
      (18)F-florbetaben Centiloids (CL) (7.7% (<36 CL), 80% (>83 CL)). (18)F-PI-2620
      standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) was correlated with increased
      (18)F-florbetaben CL in several regions of interest. Elevated (18)F-PI-2620 SUVR 
      (fusiform gyrus) was associated to high CSF p-tau and t-tau (p=0.0006 and p=0.01,
      respectively). Low hippocampal volume was associated with increased tau load at
      baseline (p=0.006 (mesial temporal); p=0.01 (fusiform gyrus)). Significant
      increases in tau SUVR were observed after 12 months, particularly in the mesial
      temporal cortex, fusiform gyrus, and inferior temporal cortex (p=0.04, p=0.047,
      p=0.02, respectively). However, no statistically significant increase in
      amyloid-beta load was measured over the observation time. The MMSE (Recall
      score), ADAS-Cog14 (Word recognition score), and CBB (One-card learning score)
      showed the strongest association with tau deposition at baseline. CONCLUSIONS:
      The findings support the hypothesis that (18)F-PI-2620 PET imaging of
      neuropathologic tau deposits may reflect underlying neurodegeneration in AD with 
      significant correlations with hippocampal volume, CSF biomarkers, and
      amyloid-beta load. Furthermore, quantifiable increases in (18)F-PI-2620 SUVR over
      a 12-month period in regions with early tau deposition are consistent with the
      hypothesis that cortical tau is associated with cognitive impairment. This study 
      supports the utility of (18)F-PI-2620 PET to assess tau deposits in an early AD
      population. Quantifiable tau load and its corresponding increase in early AD
      cases could be a relevant target engagement marker in clinical trials of
      anti-amyloid and anti-tau agents. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Data used in this
      manuscript belong to a tau PET imaging sub-study of the elenbecestat MissionAD
      Phase 3 program registered in ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT02956486 ; NCT03036280 ).

TI  - Glyphosate infiltrates the brain and increases pro-inflammatory cytokine
      TNFalpha: implications for neurodegenerative disorders.
PG  - 193
LID - 10.1186/s12974-022-02544-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Herbicides are environmental contaminants that have gained much
      attention due to the potential hazards they pose to human health. Glyphosate, the
      active ingredient in many commercial herbicides, is the most heavily applied
      herbicide worldwide. The recent rise in glyphosate application to corn and soy
      crops correlates positively with increased death rates due to Alzheimer's disease
      and other neurodegenerative disorders. Glyphosate has been shown to cross the
      blood-brain barrier in in vitro models, but has yet to be verified in vivo.
      Additionally, reports have shown that glyphosate exposure increases
      pro-inflammatory cytokines in blood plasma, particularly TNFalpha. METHODS: Here,
      we examined whether glyphosate infiltrates the brain and elevates TNFalpha levels
      in 4-month-old C57BL/6J mice. Mice received either 125, 250, or 500 mg/kg/day of 
      glyphosate, or a vehicle via oral gavage for 14 days. Urine, plasma, and brain
      samples were collected on the final day of dosing for analysis via UPLC-MS and
      ELISAs. Primary cortical neurons were derived from amyloidogenic APP/PS1 pups to 
      evaluate in vitro changes in Abeta40-42 burden and cytotoxicity. RNA sequencing
      was performed on C57BL/6J brain samples to determine changes in the
      transcriptome. RESULTS: Our analysis revealed that glyphosate infiltrated the
      brain in a dose-dependent manner and upregulated TNFalpha in both plasma and
      brain tissue post-exposure. Notably, glyphosate measures correlated positively
      with TNFalpha levels. Glyphosate exposure in APP/PS1 primary cortical neurons
      increases levels of soluble Abeta40-42 and cytotoxicity. RNAseq revealed over 200
      differentially expressed genes in a dose-dependent manner and cell-type-specific 
      deconvolution analysis showed enrichment of key biological processes in
      oligodendrocytes including myelination, axon ensheathment, glial cell
      development, and oligodendrocyte development. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these
      results show for the first time that glyphosate infiltrates the brain, elevates
      both the expression of TNFalpha and soluble Abeta, and disrupts the transcriptome
      in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that exposure to this herbicide may have
      detrimental outcomes regarding the health of the general population.

TI  - Deletion of Abi3/Gngt2 influences age-progressive amyloid beta and tau
      pathologies in distinctive ways.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The S209F variant of Abelson Interactor Protein 3 (ABI3) increases
      risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but little is known about its function in
      relation to AD pathogenesis. METHODS: Here, we use a mouse model that is
      deficient in Abi3 locus to study how the loss of function of Abi3 impacts two
      cardinal neuropathological hallmarks of AD-amyloid beta plaques and tau
      pathology. Our study employs extensive neuropathological and transcriptomic
      characterization using transgenic mouse models and adeno-associated
      virus-mediated gene targeting strategies. RESULTS: Analysis of bulk RNAseq data
      confirmed age-progressive increase in Abi3 levels in rodent models of AD-type
      amyloidosis and upregulation in AD patients relative to healthy controls. Using
      RNAscope in situ hybridization, we localized the cellular distribution of Abi3 in
      mouse and human brains, finding that Abi3 is expressed in both microglial and
      non-microglial cells. Next, we evaluated Abi3(-/-) mice and document that both
      Abi3 and its overlapping gene, Gngt2, are disrupted in these mice. Using multiple
      transcriptomic datasets, we show that expression of Abi3 and Gngt2 are tightly
      correlated in rodent models of AD and human brains, suggesting a tight
      co-expression relationship. RNAseq of the Abi3-Gngt2(-/-) mice revealed
      upregulation of Trem2, Plcg2, and Tyrobp, concomitant with induction of an
      AD-associated neurodegenerative signature, even in the absence of AD-typical
      neuropathology. In APP mice, loss of Abi3-Gngt2 resulted in a gene dose- and
      age-dependent reduction in Abeta deposition. Additionally, in Abi3-Gngt2(-/-)
      mice, expression of a pro-aggregant form of human tau exacerbated tauopathy and
      astrocytosis. Further, using in vitro culture assays, we show that the
      AD-associated S209F mutation alters the extent of ABI3 phosphorylation.
      CONCLUSIONS: These data provide an important experimental framework for
      understanding the role of Abi3-Gngt2 function and early inflammatory gliosis in
      AD. Our studies also demonstrate that inflammatory gliosis could have opposing
      effects on amyloid and tau pathology, highlighting the unpredictability of
      targeting immune pathways in AD.

AB  - All forms of dementia including Alzheimer's disease are currently incurable.
      Mitochondrial dysfunction and calcium alterations are shown to be involved in the
      mechanism of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease. Previously we have
      described the ability of compound Tg-2112x to protect neurons via sequestration
      of mitochondrial calcium uptake and we suggest that it can also be protective
      against neurodegeneration and development of dementia. Using primary co-culture
      neurons and astrocytes we studied the effect of Tg-2112x and its derivative
      Tg-2113x on beta-amyloid-induced changes in calcium signal, mitochondrial
      membrane potential, mitochondrial calcium, and cell death. We have found that
      both compounds had no effect on beta-amyloid or acetylcholine-induced calcium
      changes in the cytosol although Tg2113x, but not Tg2112x reduced
      glutamate-induced calcium signal. Both compounds were able to reduce
      mitochondrial calcium uptake and protected cells against beta-amyloid-induced
      mitochondrial depolarization and cell death. Behavioral effects of Tg-2113x on
      learning and memory in fear conditioning were also studied in 3 mouse models of
      neurodegeneration: aged (16-month-old) C57Bl/6j mice, scopolamine-induced amnesia
      (3-month-old mice), and 9-month-old 5xFAD mice. It was found that Tg-2113x
      prevented age-, scopolamine- and cerebral amyloidosis-induced decrease in fear
      conditioning. In addition, Tg-2113x restored fear extinction of aged mice. Thus, 
      reduction of the mitochondrial calcium uptake protects neurons and astrocytes
      against beta-amyloid-induced cell death and contributes to protection against
      dementia of different ethology. These compounds could be used as background for
      the developing of a novel generation of disease-modifying neuroprotective agents.

AB  - Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE-epsilon4), the strongest common genetic risk factor for
      Alzheimer's disease (AD), contributes to worse cognition in older adults.
      However, many APOE-epsilon4 carriers remain cognitively normal throughout life,
      suggesting that neuroprotective factors may be present in these individuals. In
      this study, we leverage whole-blood RNA sequencing (RNAseq) from 324 older adults
      to identify genetic modifiers of APOE-epsilon4 effects on cognition. Expression
      of RNASE6 interacted with APOE-epsilon4 status (p = 4.35 x 10(-8)) whereby higher
      RNASE6 expression was associated with worse memory at baseline among
      APOE-epsilon4 carriers. This interaction was replicated using RNAseq data from
      the prefrontal cortex in an independent dataset (N = 535; p = 0.002), suggesting 
      the peripheral effect of RNASE6 is also present in brain tissue. RNASE6 encodes
      an antimicrobial peptide involved in innate immune response and has been
      previously observed in a gene co-expression network module with other AD-related 
      inflammatory genes, including TREM2 and MS4A. Together, these data implicate
      neuroinflammation in cognitive decline, and suggest that innate immune signaling 
      may be detectable in blood and confer differential susceptibility to AD depending
      on APOE-epsilon4.

TI  - Advance Planning for Technology Use in Dementia Care: Development, Design, and
      Feasibility of a Novel Self-administered Decision-Making Tool.
PG  - e39335

AB  - BACKGROUND: Monitoring technologies are used to collect a range of information,
      such as one's location out of the home or movement within the home, and transmit 
      that information to caregivers to support aging in place. Their surveilling
      nature, however, poses ethical dilemmas and can be experienced as intrusive to
      people living with Alzheimer disease (AD) and AD-related dementias. These
      challenges are compounded when older adults are not engaged in decision-making
      about how they are monitored. Dissemination of these technologies is outpacing
      our understanding of how to communicate their functions, risks, and benefits to
      families and older adults. To date, there are no tools to help families
      understand the functions of monitoring technologies or guide them in balancing
      their perceived need for ongoing surveillance and the older adult's dignity and
      wishes. OBJECTIVE: We designed, developed, and piloted a communication and
      education tool in the form of a web application called Let's Talk Tech to support
      family decision-making about diverse technologies used in dementia home care. The
      knowledge base about how to design online interventions for people living with
      mild dementia is still in development, and dyadic interventions used in dementia 
      care remain rare. We describe the intervention's motivation and development
      process, and the feasibility of using this self-administered web application
      intervention in a pilot sample of people living with mild AD and their family
      care partners. METHODS: We surveyed 29 mild AD dementia care dyads living
      together before and after they completed the web application intervention and
      interviewed each dyad about their experiences with it. We report postintervention
      measures of feasibility (recruitment, enrollment, and retention) and
      acceptability (satisfaction, quality, and usability). Descriptive statistics were
      calculated for survey items, and thematic analysis was used with interview
      transcripts to illuminate participants' experiences and recommendations to
      improve the intervention. RESULTS: The study enrolled 33 people living with AD
      and their care partners, and 29 (88%) dyads completed the study (all but one were
      spousal dyads). Participants were asked to complete 4 technology modules, and all
      completed them. The majority of participants rated the tool as having the right
      length (>90%), having the right amount of information (>84%), being very clearly 
      worded (>74%), and presenting information in a balanced way (>90%). Most felt the
      tool was easy to use and helpful, and would likely recommend it to others.
      CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that our intervention to educate and
      facilitate conversation and documentation of preferences is preliminarily
      feasible and acceptable to mild AD care dyads. Effectively involving older adults
      in these decisions and informing care partners of their preferences could enable 
      families to avoid conflicts or risks associated with uninformed or disempowered
      use and to personalize use so both members of the dyad can experience benefits.

TI  - Network Tau spreading is vulnerable to the expression gradients of APOE and
      glutamatergic-related genes.
PG  - eabn7273
LID - 10.1126/scitranslmed.abn7273 [doi]
AB  - A key hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology is the intracellular
      accumulation of tau protein in the form of neurofibrillary tangles across
      large-scale networks of the human brain cortex. Currently, it is still unclear
      how tau accumulates within specific cortical systems and whether in situ genetic 
      traits play a role in this circuit-based propagation progression. In this study, 
      using two independent cohorts of cognitively normal older participants, we reveal
      the brain network foundation of tau spreading and its association with using
      high-resolution transcriptomic genetic data. We observed that specific
      connectomic and genetic gradients exist along the tau spreading network. In
      particular, we identified 577 genes whose expression is associated with the
      spatial spreading of tau. Within this set of genes, APOE and glutamatergic
      synaptic genes, such as SLC1A2, play a central role. Thus, our study
      characterizes neurogenetic topological vulnerabilities in distinctive brain
      circuits of tau spreading and suggests that drug development strategies targeting
      the gradient expression of this set of genes should be explored to help reduce or
      prevent pathological tau accumulation.

TI  - Fragment Localized Molecular Orbitals.
LID - 10.1021/acs.jctc.2c00359 [doi]
AB  - We introduce the concept of fragment localized molecular orbitals (FLMOs), which 
      are Hartree-Fock molecular orbitals localized in specific fragments constituting 
      a molecular system. In physical terms, we minimize the local electronic energies 
      of the different fragments, at the cost of maximizing the repulsion between them.
      To showcase the approach, we rationalize the main interactions occurring in large
      biological systems in terms of interactions between the fragments of the system. 
      In particular, we study an anticancer drug intercalated within DNA and retinal in
      anabaena sensory rhodopsin as prototypes of molecular systems embedded in
      biological matrixes. Finally, the FLMOs are exploited to rationalize the
      formation of two oligomers, prototypes of amyloid diseases, such as Parkinson and
      Alzheimer.

      acetylcholinesterase inhibitors on corpus callosum morphometry.
PG  - e0269082
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0269082 [doi]
AB  - The Corpus Callosum (CC) is an important structure that includes the majority of 
      fibers connecting the two brain hemispheres. Several neurodegenerative diseases
      may alter CC size and morphology leading to its atrophy and malfunction which may
      play a role in the pathological manifestations found in these diseases. The
      purpose of the current study is to determine any possible changes in CC size in
      patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease. The Study also investigated the
      effect of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) on the size of CC and its
      association with improvement in the Alzheimer disease severity scores.
      Midsagittal size of CC were recorded prospectively from 439 routine T1-weighted
      MRI brain images in normal individuals. The internal skull surface was measured
      to calculate CC/ internal skull surface ratio. Two groups of patients were
      studied: 300 (150 male / 150 female) were healthy subjects and 130 (55 males / 75
      females) had Alzheimer disease. Out of the 130 Alzheimer disease pateints, 70
      patients were treated with Donepezil or Rivastigmine or both. The size of the CC 
      was measured based on T1-weighted MRI images after the treatment to investigate
      any possible improvement in CC size. The mean surface area of CC in controls was 
      6.53+/-1.105 cm2. There was no significant difference between males and females
      (P < 0.627), and CC/ internal skull surface ratio was 4.41+/-0.77%. Patients with
      mild or severe Alzheimer disease showed a significant reduction in CC size
      compared to healthy controls. Treating mild Alzheimer patients with either
      Donepezil or Rivastigmine exerts a comparable therapeutic effect in improving the
      CC size. There was more improvement in the size of CC in patients with severe
      Alzheimer disease by using combined therapy of Donepezil and Rivastigmine than
      using single a medication. we measured the mean size of the various portions of
      the corpus callosum in normal individuals and Alzheimer patients before and after
      taking Donepezil and Rivastigmine. Alzheimer patients have pronounced reduction
      in CC which is corrected after taking Donepezil and Rivastigmine leading to
      remarkable improvement in Alzheimer disease severity scores.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In addition to the
      pulmonary manifestations, COVID-19 patients may present a wide range of
      neurological disorders as extrapulmonary presentations. In this view, several
      studies have recently documented the worsening of neurological symptoms within
      COVID-19 morbidity in patients previously diagnosed with neurodegenerative
      diseases (NDs). Moreover, several cases have also been reported in which the
      patients presented parkinsonian features after initial COVID-19 symptoms. These
      data raise a major concern about the possibility of communication between
      SARS-CoV-2 infection and the initiation and/or worsening of NDs. In this review, 
      we have collected compelling evidence suggesting SARS-CoV-2, as an environmental

TI  - Heterozygous expression of the Alzheimer's disease-protective PLCgamma2 P522R
      variant enhances Abeta clearance while preserving synapses.
PG  - 453
LID - 10.1007/s00018-022-04473-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A rare coding variant, P522R, in the phospholipase C gamma 2 (PLCG2) 
      gene has been identified as protective against late-onset Alzheimer's disease
      (AD), but the mechanism is unknown. PLCG2 is exclusively expressed in microglia
      within the central nervous system, and altered microglial function has been
      implicated in the progression of AD. METHODS: Healthy control hiPSCs were CRISPR 
      edited to generate cells heterozygous and homozygous for the PLCG2(P522R)
      variant. Microglia derived from these hiPSC's were used to investigate the impact
      of PLCgamma2(P522R) on disease relevant processes, specifically microglial
      capacity to take up amyloid beta (Abeta) and synapses. Targeted qPCR assessment
      was conducted to explore expression changes in core AD linked and microglial
      genes, and mitochondrial function was assessed using an Agilent Seahorse assay.
      RESULTS: Heterozygous expression of the P522R variant resulted in increased
      microglial clearance of Abeta, while preserving synapses. This was associated
      with the upregulation of a number of genes, including the anti-inflammatory
      cytokine Il-10, and the synapse-linked CX3CR1, as well as alterations in
      mitochondrial function, and increased cellular motility. The protective capacity 
      of PLCgamma2(P522R) appeared crucially dependent on (gene) 'dose', as cells
      homozygous for the variant showed reduced synapse preservation, and a
      differential gene expression profile relative to heterozygous cells. CONCLUSION: 
      These findings suggest that PLCgamma2(P522R) may result in increased surveillance
      by microglia, and prime them towards an anti-inflammatory state, with an
      increased capacity to respond to increasing energy demands, but highlights the
      delicate balance of this system, with increasing PLCgamma2(P522R) 'dose'
      resulting in reduced beneficial impacts.

TI  - Dulaglutide Alleviates Alzheimer's Disease by Regulating Microglial Polarization 
      and Neurogenic Activity.
LID - 10.2174/1386207325666220726163514 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUNDS: Increasing research has proved that microglial activation,
      polarization, and inflammatory response in the brain affect the pathology of
      Alzheimer's disease. Hence, employing reagents targeted to microglial functions
      to optimize the brain microenvironment may become a promising therapeutic method 
      for Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: The phagocytosis and clearance of Abeta1-42
      were detected using western blot and immunofluorescence assay. The cell viability
      was determined via 3-(4, 5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
      (MTT) or cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. The load of pro-inflammation in
      addition to anti-inflammation factors was measured through enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent (ELISA) assay. Flow cytometry was employed to estimate the
      apoptotic cells. The protein level related to microglial polarization and
      neuronal injury was detected via western blot. The length of the neuronal synapse
      was investigated by using an immunofluorescence assay. RESULTS: Dulaglutide
      significantly promoted microglia to phagocytose and get rid of the Abeta plague. 
      Additionally, dulaglutide treatment inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory 
      factors, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin -1beta, and
      IL-6, whereas increased the load of anti-inflammatory molecules such as IL-10
      affected by Abeta1-42 exposure. Further investigation verified that Abeta1-42
      down-regulated YM1/2 positive M2 microglial polarization phenotype but
      up-regulated cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox2) positive M1 microglia. However, treating
      with dulaglutide effectively counteracted these effects. Moreover, dulaglutide
      dramatically recovered primary cortical neuron cells viability and inhibited
      cells apoptosis influenced by Abeta1-42. Furthermore, the dulaglutide also
      reversed neuronal synapse injury after exposure to Abeta1-42. CONCLUSION:
      Altogether, this investigation verified that dulaglutide improved Abeta-induced
      inflammation and neuronal injury by mediating the activation and polarization of 
      microglia, thereby alleviating Alzheimer's disease efficiently.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and
      represents the leading cause of cognitive impairment and dementia in older
      individuals throughout the world. The main hallmarks of AD include brain atrophy,
      extracellular deposition of insoluble amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques, and the
      intracellular aggregation of protein tau in neurofibrillary tangles. These
      pathological modifications start many years prior to clinical manifestations of
      disease and the spectrum of AD progresses along a continuum from preclinical to
      clinical phases. Therefore, identifying specific biomarkers for detecting AD at
      early stages greatly improves clinical management. However, stable and
      non-invasive biomarkers are not currently available for the early detection of
      the disease. In the search for more reliable biomarkers, epigenetic mechanisms,
      able to mediate the interaction between the genome and the environment, are
      emerging as important players in AD pathogenesis. Herein, we discuss altered
      epigenetic signatures in blood as potential peripheral biomarkers for the early
      detection of AD in order to help diagnosis and improve therapy.

LID - 1306 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/genes13081306 [doi]
AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients show a 
      higher prevalence of Lewy body disease than the general population. Additionally,
      parkinsonian features were found in about 30% of ALS patients. We aimed to
      explore the frequency of Parkinson's disease (PD)-causative genes in ALS
      patients, compared to AD and healthy controls (HCs). We used next-generation
      sequencing multigene panels by analyzing SNCA, LRRK2, PINK1, PARK2, PARK7, SYNJ1,
      CHCHD2, PLA2G6, GCH1, ATP13A2, DNAJC6 and FBXO genes. GBA gene, a risk factor for
      PD, was also analyzed. In total, 130 ALS and 100 AD patients were investigated.
      PD-related genes were found to be altered in 26.2% of ALS, 20% of AD patients and
      19.2% of HCs. Autosomal recessive genes were significantly more involved in ALS
      as compared to AD and HCs (p = 0.021). PARK2 variants were more frequent in ALS
      than in AD and HCs, although not significantly. However, the p.Arg402Cys variant 
      was increased in ALS than in HCs (p = 0.025). This finding is consistent with
      current literature, as parkin levels were found to be decreased in ALS animal
      models and patients. Our results confirm the possible role of PD-related genes as
      risk modifier in ALS pathogenesis.

TI  - Proteomic Assessment of C57BL/6 Hippocampi after Non-Selective Pharmacological
      Inhibition of Nitric Oxide Synthase Activity: Implications of Seizure-like
      Neuronal Hyperexcitability Followed by Tauopathy.
LID - 1772 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines10081772 [doi]
AB  - Nitric oxide (NO) is a small gaseous signaling molecule responsible for
      maintaining homeostasis in a myriad of tissues and molecular pathways in
      neurology and the cardiovasculature. In recent years, there has been increasing
      interest in the potential interaction between arterial stiffness (AS), an
      independent cardiovascular risk factor, and neurodegenerative syndromes given
      increasingly epidemiological study reports. For this reason, we previously
      investigated the mechanistic convergence between AS and neurodegeneration via the
      progressive non-selective inhibition of all nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms 
      with N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) in C57BL/6 mice. Our previous
      results showed progressively increased AS in vivo and impaired visuospatial
      learning and memory in L-NAME-treated C57BL/6 mice. In the current study, we
      sought to further investigate the progressive molecular signatures in hippocampal
      tissue via LC-MS/MS proteomic analysis. Our data implicate mitochondrial
      dysfunction due to progressive L-NAME treatment. Two weeks of L-NAME treatment
      implicates altered G-protein-coupled-receptor signaling in the nerve synapse and 
      associated presence of seizures and altered emotional behavior. Furthermore,
      molecular signatures implicate the cerebral presence of seizure-related
      hyperexcitability after short-term (8 weeks) treatment followed by ribosomal
      dysfunction and tauopathy after long-term (16 weeks) treatment.

TI  - Mitigation of Memory Impairment with Fermented Fucoidan and lambda-Carrageenan
      Supplementation through Modulating the Gut Microbiota and Their Metagenome
      Function in Hippocampal Amyloid-beta Infused Rats.
LID - 2301 [pii]

AB  - Attenuating acetylcholinesterase and insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1
      signaling in the hippocampus is associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD)
      development. Fucoidan and carrageenan are brown and red algae, respectively, with
      potent antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antiviral activities.
      This study examined how low-molecular-weight (MW) and high-MW fucoidan and
      lambda-carrageenan would improve memory impairment in Alzheimer's disease-induced
      rats caused by an infusion of toxic amyloid-beta(Abeta). Fucoidan and
      lambda-carrageenan were dissected into low-MW by Luteolibacter&amp;nbsp;algae and
      Pseudoalteromonas&amp;nbsp;carrageenovora. Rats receiving an Abeta(25-35)
      infusion in the CA1 region of the hippocampus were fed dextrin (AD-Con), 1%
      high-MW fucoidan (AD-F-H), 1% low-MW fucoidan (AD-F-L), 1% high-MW
      lambda-carrageenan (AD-C-H), and 1% low-MW lambda-carrageenan (AD-C-L) for six
      weeks. Rats to receive saline infusion (Normal-Con) had an AD-Con diet. The
      AD-F-L group showed an improved memory function, which manifested as an enhanced 
      Y-maze spontaneous alternation test, water maze, and passive avoidance tests,
      similar to the Normal-Con group. AD-F-L also potentiated hippocampal insulin
      signaling and increased the expression of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and 
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus. AD-C-L improved the 
      memory function mainly by increasing the BDNF content. AD-F-H and AD-C-H did not 
      improve the memory function. Compared to AD-Con, the ascending order of AD-C-H,
      AD-F-H, AD-C-L, and AD-F-L increased insulin signaling by enhancing the
      pSTAT3(R)pAkt(R)pGSK-3beta pathway. AD-F-L improved glucose tolerance the most.
      Compared to AD-CON, the AD-F-L treatment increased the serum acetate
      concentrations and compensated for the defect of cerebral glucose metabolism.
      AD-Con increased Clostridium, Terrisporobacter and Sporofaciens compared to
      Normal-Con, and AD-F-L and AD-C-L increased Akkermentia. In conclusion, AD-F-L
      and AD-C-L alleviated the memory function in the rats with induced AD symptoms by
      modulating.

      Reservoir of Amyloid Beta Protein Associated with Bacterial Infection.
LID - 2285 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/cells11152285 [doi]
AB  - Amyloid-beta (Abeta)-peptide production or deposition in the neuropathology of
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) was shown to be caused by chronic inflammation that may 
      be induced by infection, but the role of pathogenic-bacteria-related
      AD-associated Abeta is not yet clearly understood. In this study, we validated
      the hypothesis that there is a correlation between the Abeta-protein road and
      bacterial infection and that there are effects of bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus
      (S. aureus), on the Abeta road in the inflammatory environment of human tonsils. 
      Here, we detected Abeta-peptide deposits in human tonsil tissue as well as tissue
      similar to tonsilloliths found in the olfactory cleft. Interestingly, we
      demonstrated for the first time the presence of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)
      clustered around or embedded in the Abeta deposits. Notably, we showed that
      treatment with S. aureus upregulated the Abeta-protein road in cultures of human 
      tonsil organoids and brain organoids, showing the new role of S. aureus in
      Abeta-protein aggregation. These findings suggest that a reservoir of Abeta and
      pathogenic bacteria may be a possible therapeutic target in human tonsils,
      supporting the treatment of antibiotics to prevent the deposition of Abeta
      peptides via the removal of pathogens in the intervention of AD pathogenesis.

TI  - The Monkey Head Mushroom and Memory Enhancement in Alzheimer's Disease.
LID - 2284 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/cells11152284 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, and no effective
      treatments are available to treat this disorder. Therefore, researchers have been
      investigating Hericium erinaceus, or the monkey head mushroom, an edible
      medicinal mushroom, as a possible treatment for AD. In this narrative review, we 
      evaluated six preclinical and three clinical studies of the therapeutic effects
      of Hericium erinaceus on AD. Preclinical trials have successfully demonstrated
      that extracts and bioactive compounds of Hericium erinaceus have potential
      beneficial effects in ameliorating cognitive functioning and behavioral deficits 
      in animal models of AD. A limited number of clinical studies have been conducted 
      and several clinical trials are ongoing, which have thus far shown analogous
      outcomes to the preclinical studies. Nonetheless, future research on Hericium
      erinaceus needs to focus on elucidating the specific neuroprotective mechanisms
      and the target sites in AD. Additionally, standardized treatment parameters and
      universal regulatory systems need to be established to further ensure treatment
      safety and efficacy. In conclusion, Hericium erinaceus has therapeutic potential 
      and may facilitate memory enhancement in patients with AD.

      Point-of-Care Testing of Tau Protein in the Blood.
LID - 564 [pii]

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a long-term neurodegenerative disease that poses a
      serious threat to human life and health. It is very important to develop a
      portable quantitative device for AD diagnosis and personal healthcare. Herein, we
      develop a portable electrochemical sensing platform for the point-of-care
      detection of AD biomarkers in the blood. Such a portable platform integrates
      nanoAu-modified vertical graphene (VG@Au) into a working electrode, which can
      significantly improve sensitivity and reduce detection limit due to the large
      specific surface, excellent electrical conductivity, high stability, and good
      biocompatibility. The tau protein, as an important factor in the course of AD, is
      selected as a key AD biomarker. The results show that the linear range of this
      sensing platform is 0.1 pg/mL to 1 ng/mL, with a detection limit of 0.034 pg/mL
      (S/N = 3), indicating that this portable sensing platform meets the demand for
      the detection of the tau protein in the blood. This work offers great potential
      for AD diagnosis and personal healthcare.

LID - 990 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/brainsci12080990 [doi]
AB  - Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is considered an intermediate state between
      normal aging and early dementia. Fear of falling (FOF) could be considered a risk
      indicator for falls and quality of life in individuals with MCI. Our objective
      was to explore factors associated with FOF in those with MCI due to Alzheimer's
      disease (AD-MCI) and mild cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD-MCI).
      Seventy-one participants were separated into two groups, AD-MCI (n = 37) and
      PD-MCI (n = 34), based on the disease diagnosis. FOF was assessed using the
      Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale. The neuropsychological assessment
      and gait assessment were also measured. FOF was significantly correlated with
      global cognitive function, attention and working memory, executive function,
      Tinetti assessment scale scores, gait speed, and stride length in the AD-MCI
      group. Moreover, attention and working memory were the most important factors
      contributing to FOF. In the PD-MCI group, FOF was significantly correlated with
      gait speed, and time up and go subtask performance. Furthermore, turn-to-walk was
      the most important factor contributing to FOF. We noted that FOF in different
      types of MCI was determined by different factors. Therapies that aim to lower FOF
      in AD-MCI and PD-MCI populations may address attention and working memory and
      turn-to-walk, respectively.

      Evaluation of Natural Coumarins.
LID - 10.1002/cmdc.202200300 [doi]
AB  - Plants have immensely contributed to the drug discovery for neurodegenerative
      diseases. Herein, we undertook the phytochemical investigation of Nardostachys
      jatamansi (D.Don) DC. rhizomes followed by semisynthetic modifications to
      discover cholinesterase (ChE) and beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving
      enzyme 1 (BACE-1) inhibitors. The 8-acetyl-7-hydroxycoumarin isolated from the
      bioactive extract moderately inhibits acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and BACE-1 with
      IC50 values of 22.1 and 17.7 muM, respectively. The semisynthetic trifluoromethyl
      substituted coumarin chalcone display a 5-fold improvement in BACE-1 inhibition
      (IC50 3.3 muM). Another semisynthetic derivative, a coumarin-donepezil hybrid,
      exhibits dual inhibition of both ChEs with IC50 values of 1.22 and 3.09 muM,
      respectively. Molecular modeling and enzyme kinetics revealed that the
      coumarin-donepezil hybrid is a non-competitive inhibitor of AChE. It crosses the 
      blood-brain barrier and also inhibits Abeta self-aggregation. The results
      presented herein warrant a detailed investigation of the coumarin-donepezil
      hybrid in preclinical models of Alzheimer's disease.

      functions?
PG  - 1447-1449
LID - 10.1093/ckj/sfac028 [doi]
AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with cognitive functional impairment
      or dementia in addition to cardiovascular diseases. Aging of the population and
      the increasing prevalence of CKD in elderly patients are making dementia more
      prevalent. Blood pressure (BP) variability is an important risk factor for
      dementia. Although ample data link high BP variability with the risk of dementia 
      in the general population, data on CKD patients are scarce. An observational
      cohort study conducted by Park et al., including 103 139 patients, demonstrated a
      strong association between higher visit-to-visit BP variability and increased
      risk of dementia in CKD patients. Both higher systolic and diastolic BP
      variabilities were associated with any type of dementia, including Alzheimer's
      and vascular dementia. Physicians must be aware of BP variability when evaluating
      CKD patients with hypertension.

TI  - Tunable White Light for Elders (TWLITE): A Protocol Demonstrating Feasibility and
      Acceptability for Deployment, Remote Data Collection, and Analysis of a
      Home-Based Lighting Intervention in Older Adults.
LID - 5372 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s22145372 [doi]
AB  - Sleep disturbances are common in older adults and may contribute to disease
      progression in certain populations (e.g., Alzheimer's disease). Light therapy is 
      a simple and cost-effective intervention to improve sleep. Primary barriers to
      light therapy are: (1) poor acceptability of the use of devices, and (2)
      inflexibility of current devices to deliver beyond a fixed light spectrum and
      throughout the entirety of the day. However, dynamic, tunable lighting integrated
      into the native home lighting system can potentially overcome these limitations. 
      Herein, we describe our protocol to implement a whole-home tunable lighting
      system installed throughout the homes of healthy older adults already enrolled in
      an existing study with embedded home assessment platforms (Oregon Center for
      Aging & Technology-ORCATECH). Within ORCATECH, continuous data on room location, 
      activity, sleep, and general health parameters are collected at a
      minute-to-minute resolution over years of participation. This single-arm
      longitudinal protocol collected participants' light usage in addition to ORCATECH
      outcome measures over a several month period before and after light installation.
      The protocol was implemented with four subjects living in three ORCATECH homes.
      Technical/usability challenges and feasibility/acceptability outcomes were
      explored. The successful implementation of our protocol supports the feasibility 
      of implementing and integrating tunable whole-home lighting systems into an
      automated home-based assessment platform for continuous data collection of
      outcome variables, including long-term sleep measures. Challenges and iterative
      approaches are discussed. This protocol will inform the implementation of future 
      clinical intervention trials using light therapy in patients at risk for
      developing Alzheimer's disease and related conditions.

TI  - Honeys as Possible Sources of Cholinesterase Inhibitors.
LID - 2969 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14142969 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterised
      by low levels of the neurotransmitter (acetylcholine), oxidative stress, and
      inflammation of the central nervous system. The only currently available form of 
      treatment entails the administration of AChE/BChE
      (acetylcholinesterase/butyrylcholinesterase) inhibitors to patients diagnosed
      with the disease. However, AD prevention is possible by administering the correct
      inhibitors with food. The aim of this study was to examine 19 types of honey in
      terms of their contents of cholinesterase inhibitors. The inhibition of AChE and 
      BChE relative to the respective honey samples was evaluated using Ellman's
      colorimetric method, including the "false-positive" effect. The highest potential
      for AChE inhibition was observed in the case of thyme honey (21.17% inhibition), 
      while goldenrod honey showed the highest capacity for BChE inhibition (33.89%).
      Our study showed that honeys may provide a rich source of cholinesterase
      inhibitors and, in this way, play a significant role in AD.

TI  - Fatty Acids: A Safe Tool for Improving Neurodevelopmental Alterations in Down
      Syndrome?
LID - 2880 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14142880 [doi]
AB  - The triplication of chromosome 21 causes Down syndrome (DS), a genetic disorder
      that is characterized by intellectual disability (ID). The causes of ID start in 
      utero, leading to impairments in neurogenesis, and continue into infancy, leading
      to impairments in dendritogenesis, spinogenesis, and connectivity. These defects 
      are associated with alterations in mitochondrial and metabolic functions and
      precocious aging, leading to the early development of Alzheimer's disease.
      Intense efforts are currently underway, taking advantage of DS mouse models to
      discover pharmacotherapies for the neurodevelopmental and cognitive deficits of
      DS. Many treatments that proved effective in mouse models may raise safety
      concerns over human use, especially at early life stages. Accumulating evidence
      shows that fatty acids, which are nutrients present in normal diets, exert
      numerous positive effects on the brain. Here, we review (i) the knowledge
      obtained from animal models regarding the effects of fatty acids on the brain, by
      focusing on alterations that are particularly prominent in DS, and (ii) the
      progress recently made in a DS mouse model, suggesting that fatty acids may
      indeed represent a useful treatment for DS. This scenario should prompt the
      scientific community to further explore the potential benefit of fatty acids for 
      people with DS.

TI  - Inhibition of Microtubule Affinity Regulating Kinase 4 by Metformin: Exploring
      the Neuroprotective Potential of Antidiabetic Drug through Spectroscopic and
      Computational Approaches.

LID - 10.3390/molecules27144652 [doi]
AB  - Microtubule affinity regulating kinase 4 (MARK4) regulates the mechanism of
      microtubules by its ability to phosphorylate the microtubule-associated proteins 
      (MAP's). MARK4 is known for its major role in tau phosphorylation via
      phosphorylating Ser(262) residue in the KXGS motif, which results in the
      detachment of tau from microtubule. In lieu of this vital role in tau pathology, 
      a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), MARK4 is a druggable target to treat AD
      and other neurodegenerative disorders (NDs). There is growing evidence that NDs
      and diabetes are connected with many pieces of literature demonstrating a high
      risk of developing AD in diabetic patients. Metformin (Mtf) has been a drug in
      use against type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) for a long time; however, recent
      studies have established its therapeutic effect in neurodegenerative diseases
      (NDs), namely AD, Parkinson's disease (PD) and amnestic mild cognitive
      impairment. In this study, we have explored the MARK4 inhibitory potential of
      Mtf, employing in silico and in vitro approaches. Molecular docking demonstrated 
      that Mtf binds to MARK4 with a significant affinity of -6.9 kcal/mol forming
      interactions with binding pocket's critical residues. Additionally, molecular
      dynamics (MD) simulation provided an atomistic insight into the binding of Mtf
      with MARK4. ATPase assay of MARK4 in the presence of Mtf shows that it inhibits
      MARK4 with an IC50 = 7.05 microM. The results of the fluorescence binding assay
      demonstrated significant binding of MARK4 with a binding constant of 0.6 x 10(6) 
      M(-1). The present study provides an additional axis towards the utilization of
      Mtf as MARK4 inhibitor targeting diabetes with NDs.

TI  - Inosine in Neurodegenerative Diseases: From the Bench to the Bedside.
LID - 4644 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27144644 [doi]
AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease
      (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and multiple sclerosis (MS), currently
      represent major unmet medical needs. Therefore, novel therapeutic strategies are 
      needed in order to improve patients' quality of life and prognosis. Since
      oxidative stress can be strongly involved in neurodegenerative diseases, the
      potential use of inosine, known for its antioxidant properties, in this context
      deserves particular attention. The protective action of inosine treatment could
      be mediated by its metabolite urate. Here, we review the current preclinical and 
      clinical studies investigating the use of inosine in AD, PD, ALS, and MS. The
      most important properties of inosine seem to be its antioxidant action and its
      ability to raise urate levels and to increase energetic resources by improving
      ATP availability. Inosine appears to be generally safe and well tolerated;
      however, the possible formation of kidney stones should be monitored, and data on
      its effectiveness should be further explored since, so far, they have been
      controversial. Overall, inosine could be a promising potential strategy in the
      management of neurodegenerative diseases, and additional studies are needed in
      order to further investigate its safety and efficacy and its use as a
      complementary therapy along with other approved drugs.

TI  - [(124)I]IBETA: A New Abeta Plaque Positron Emission Tomography Imaging Agent for 
      Alzheimer's Disease.
LID - 4552 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27144552 [doi]
AB  - Several fluorine-18-labeled PET beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaque radiotracers for
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) are in clinical use. However, no radioiodinated imaging 
      agent for Abeta plaques has been successfully moved forward for either
      single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission
      tomography (PET) imaging. Radioiodinated pyridyl benzofuran derivatives for the
      SPECT imaging of Abeta plaques using iodine-123 and iodine-125 are being pursued.
      In this study, we assess the iodine-124 radioiodinated pyridyl benzofuran
      derivative 5-(5-[(124)I]iodobenzofuran-2-yl)-N,N-dimethylpyridin-2-amine
      ([(124)I]IBETA) (Ki = 2.36 nM) for utilization in PET imaging for Abeta plaques. 
      We report our findings on the radioiododestannylation reaction used to prepare
      [(124/125)I]IBETA and evaluate its binding to Abeta plaques in a 5 x FAD mouse
      model and postmortem human AD brain. Both [(125)I]IBETA and [(124)I]IBETA are
      produced in &gt;25% radiochemical yield and &gt;85% radiochemical purity. The in 
      vitro binding of [(125)I]IBETA and [(124)I]IBETA in transgenic 5 x FAD mouse
      model for Abeta plaques was high in the frontal cortex, anterior cingulate,
      thalamus, and hippocampus, which are regions of high Abeta accumulation, with
      very little binding in the cerebellum (ratio of brain regions to cerebellum was
      &gt;5). The in vitro binding of [(125)I]IBETA and [(124)I]IBETA in postmortem
      human AD brains was higher in gray matter containing Abeta plaques compared to
      white matter (ratio of gray to white matter was &gt;5). Anti-Abeta immunostaining
      strongly correlated with [(124)/(125)I]IBETA regional binding in both the 5 x FAD
      mouse and postmortem AD human brains. The binding of [(124)/(125)I]IBETA in 5 x
      FAD mouse and postmortem human AD brains was displaced by the known Abeta plaque 
      imaging agent, Flotaza. Preliminary PET/CT studies of [(124)I]IBETA in the 5 x
      FAD mouse model suggested [(124)I]IBETA was relatively stable in vivo with a
      greater localization of [(124)I]IBETA in the brain regions with a high
      concentration of Abeta plaques. Some deiodination was observed at later time
      points. Therefore, [(124)I]IBETA may potentially be a useful PET radioligand for 
      Abeta plaques in brain studies.

      Miltiorrhizae (Danshen) for Treating Alzheimer's Disease.
LID - 4463 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27144463 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common age-related neurodegenerative disease that
      strikes millions worldwide. Herein, we demonstrate a new approach based on
      network target to identify anti-AD compounds from Danshen. Network pharmacology
      and molecular docking were employed to establish the DS-AD network, which mainly 
      involved apoptosis of neuron cells. Then network scoring was confirmed via
      Connectivity Map analysis. M308 (Danshenxinkun D) was an anti-AD candidate with a
      high score (p &lt; 0.01). Furthermore, we conducted ex vivo experiments with
      H2O2-treated PC12 cells to verify the neuroprotective effect of Salvia
      miltiorrhiza-containing plasma (SMP), and UPLC-Q-TOF/MS and RT-qPCR were
      performed to demonstrate the anti-AD activity of M308 from SMP. Results revealed 
      that SMP could enhance cell viability and level of acetylcholine. AO/EB staining 
      and Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) analysis showed that SMP significantly
      suppressed apoptosis, which may be due to anti-oxidative stress activity.
      Moreover, the effects of M308 and SMP on expressions of PSEN1, DRD2, and APP mRNA
      were consistent, and M308 can significantly reverse the expression of PSEN1 and
      DRD2 mRNA in H2O2-treated PC12 cells. The strategy based on the network could be 
      employed to identify anti-AD compounds from Chinese herbs. Notably, M308 stands
      out as a promising anti-AD candidate for development.

      Bovista plumbe to obtain tyrosol-enriched Bio-RSE. The objective of this study
      was to investigate the effects of Bio-RSE on the activation of the cholinergic
      system and the inhibition of oxidative stress in mice with scopolamine
      (Sco)-induced memory impairment. Sco (1 mg/kg body weight, i.p.) impaired the
      mice's performance on the Y-maze test, passive avoidance test, and water maze
      test. However, the number of abnormal behaviors was reduced in the groups
      supplemented with Bio-RSE. Bio-RSE treatment improved working memory and
      avoidance times against electronic shock, increased step-through latency, and
      reduced the time to reach the escape zone in the water maze test. Bio-RSE
      dramatically improved the cholinergic system by decreasing acetylcholinesterase
      activity and regulated oxidative stress by increasing antioxidant enzymes
      (superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT)). The reduction in nuclear factor 
      erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) signaling in the
      brain tissue due to scopolamine was restored by the administration of Bio-RSE.
      Bio-RSE also significantly decreased amyloid-beta 1-42 (Abeta1-42) and amyloid
      precursor protein (APP) expression. Moreover, the increased malondialdehyde (MDA)
      level and low total antioxidant capacity in Sco-treated mouse brains were
      reversed by Bio-RSE, and an increase in Nrf2 and HO-1 was also observed. In
      conclusion, Bio-RSE protected against Sco-induced cognitive impairment by
      activating Nrf2/HO-1 signaling and may be developed as a potential beneficial
      material for AD.

TI  - A Comprehensive Review on the Benefits and Problems of Curcumin with Respect to
      Human Health.
LID - 4400 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27144400 [doi]
AB  - Curcumin is the most important active component in turmeric extracts. Curcumin, a
      natural monomer from plants has received a considerable attention as a dietary
      supplement, exhibiting evident activity in a wide range of human pathological
      conditions. In general, curcumin is beneficial to human health, demonstrating
      pharmacological activities of anti-inflammation and antioxidation, as well as
      antitumor and immune regulation activities. Curcumin also presents therapeutic
      potential in neurodegenerative, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. In
      this review article, we summarize the advancements made in recent years with
      respect to curcumin as a biologically active agent in malignant tumors,
      Alzheimer's disease (AD), hematological diseases and viral infectious diseases.
      We also focus on problems associated with curcumin from basic research to
      clinical translation, such as its low solubility, leading to poor
      bioavailability, as well as the controversy surrounding the association between
      curcumin purity and effect. Through a review and summary of the clinical research
      on curcumin and case reports of adverse effects, we found that the clinical
      transformation of curcumin is not successful, and excessive intake of curcumin
      may have adverse effects on the kidneys, heart, liver, blood and immune system,
      which leads us to warn that curcumin has a long way to go from basic research to 
      application transformation.

TI  - Allostery Inhibition of BACE1 by Psychotic and Meroterpenoid Drugs in Alzheimer's
      Disease Therapy.
LID - 4372 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27144372 [doi]
AB  - In over a century since its discovery, Alzheimer's disease (AD) has continued to 
      be a global health concern due to its incurable nature and overwhelming increase 
      among older people. In this paper, we give an overview of the efforts of
      researchers towards identifying potent BACE1 exosite-binding antibodies and
      allosteric inhibitors. Herein, we apply computer-aided drug design (CADD) methods
      to unravel the interactions of some proposed psychotic and meroterpenoid BACE1
      allosteric site inhibitors. This study is aimed at validating the allosteric
      potentials of these selected compounds targeted at BACE1 inhibition. Molecular
      docking, molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, and post-MD analyses are carried out
      on these selected compounds, which have been experimentally proven to exhibit
      allosteric inhibition on BACE1. The SwissDock software enabled us to identify
      more than five druggable pockets on the BACE1 structural surface using docking.
      Besides the active site region, a melatonin derivative (compound 1) previously
      proposed as a BACE1 allostery inhibitor showed appreciable stability at eight
      different subsites on BACE1. Refinement with molecular dynamic (MD) simulations
      shows that the identified non-catalytic sites are potential allostery sites for
      compound 1. The allostery and binding mechanism of the selected potent inhibitors
      show that the smaller the molecule, the easier the attachment to several enzyme
      regions. This finding hereby establishes that most of these selected compounds
      failed to exhibit strong allosteric binding with BACE1 except for compound 1. We 
      hereby suggest that further studies and additional identification/validation of
      other BACE1 allosteric compounds be done. Furthermore, this additional allosteric
      site investigation will help in reducing the associated challenges with designing
      BACE1 inhibitors while exploring the opportunities in the design of allosteric
      BACE1 inhibitors.

TI  - The Influence of Orthopedic Surgery on Circulating Metabolite Levels, and their
      Associations with the Incidence of Postoperative Delirium.
LID - 616 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/metabo12070616 [doi]
AB  - The mechanisms underlying the occurrence of postoperative delirium development
      are unclear and measurement of plasma metabolites may improve understanding of
      its causes. Participants (n = 54) matched for age and gender were sampled from an
      observational cohort study investigating postoperative delirium. Participants
      were >/=65 years without a diagnosis of dementia and presented for primary
      elective hip or knee arthroplasty. Plasma samples collected pre- and
      postoperatively were grouped as either control (n = 26, aged: 75.8 +/- 5.2) or
      delirium (n = 28, aged: 76.2 +/- 5.7). Widespread changes in plasma metabolite
      levels occurred following surgery. The only metabolites significantly differing
      between corresponding control and delirium samples were ornithine and spermine.
      In delirium cases, ornithine was 17.6% higher preoperatively, and spermine was
      12.0% higher postoperatively. Changes were not associated with various
      perioperative factors. In binary logistic regression modeling, these two
      metabolites did not confer a significantly increased risk of delirium. These
      findings support the hypothesis that disturbed polyamine metabolism is an
      underlying factor in delirium that warrants further investigation.

AB  - Background and Objectives: The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) defines a
      biomarker as a characteristic that is measured as an indicator of normal
      biological processes, pathogenic processes, or responses to an exposure or
      intervention. Biomarkers may be used in clinical care or as drug development
      tools (DDTs) in clinical trials. The goal of this review and perspective is to
      provide insight into the regulatory guidance for the use of biomarkers in
      clinical trials and clinical care. Materials and Methods: We reviewed FDA
      guidances relevant to biomarker use in clinical trials and their transition to
      use in clinical care. We identified instructive examples of these biomarkers in
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) drug development and their application in clinical
      practice. Results: For use in clinical trials, biomarkers must have a defined
      context of use (COU) as a risk/susceptibility, diagnostic, monitoring,
      predictive, prognostic, pharmacodynamic, or safety biomarker. A four-stage
      process defines the pathway to establish the regulatory acceptance of the COU for
      a biomarker including submission of a letter of intent, description of the
      qualification plan, submission of a full qualification package, and acceptance
      through a qualification recommendation. Biomarkers used in clinical care may be
      companion biomarkers, in vitro diagnostic devices (IVDs), or laboratory developed
      tests (LDTs). A five-phase biomarker development process has been proposed to
      structure the biomarker development process. Conclusions: Biomarkers are
      increasingly important in drug development and clinical care. Adherence to
      regulatory guidance for biomarkers used in clinical trials and patient care is
      required to advance these important drug development and clinical tools.

TI  - The Knowledge and Attitudes of Primary Care and the Barriers to Early Detection
      and Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease.

AB  - Primary care physicians play a vital role in the clinical care of their patients,
      early identification of dementia, and disease advocacy. It is essential to assess
      the knowledge and attitudes of physicians in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease
      and other dementias. In primary care, the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is
      often missed or delayed. With the increased prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and
      the growing impact of dementia on health care resources, early detection by
      primary care physicians (PCP) is essential. Thus, their knowledge and attitudes
      about early detection and diagnosis are crucial. To examine the knowledge and
      attitudes of primary care physicians regarding early detection and diagnosis of
      Alzheimer's disease and how barriers may contribute to missed and delayed
      detection and diagnosis. An interpretive scope review was used to synthesize and 
      analyze a body of literature published over the past decade. The study population
      are physicians in the United States. The current health systems experience
      challenges in providing early, safe, accurate, and comprehensive Alzheimer's
      diagnosis and care by a primary care physician trained or knowledgeable in
      diagnosing the various forms of dementia. This article identifies several
      interrelated obstacles to early detection and diagnosis in primary dementia care,
      including gaps in knowledge, attitudes, skills, and resources for person with
      dementia (PWD)/caregivers and their primary care providers and systematic and
      structural barriers that negatively impact dementia care. Research shows that
      Alzheimer's disease has gone underdiagnosed and undertreated. Delays in
      detection, diagnosis, and resource utilization may have social and clinical
      implications for individuals affected by Alzheimer's disease and their families, 
      including challenges in obtaining an accurate diagnosis. Until the issues of
      missed and delayed Alzheimer's screening become more compelling, efforts to
      promote early detection and diagnosis should focus on the education of physicians
      and removing the barriers to diagnosis.

TI  - Logogenic Primary Progressive Aphasia or Alzheimer Disease: Contribution of
      Acoustic Markers in Early Differential Diagnosis.
LID - 933 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/life12070933 [doi]
AB  - The logopenic variant of Primary Progressive Aphasia (lvPPA), a syndromic
      disorder centered on language impairment, often presents variable underlying
      neurodegenerative pathologies such as Alzheimer Disease (AD). Actual language
      assessment tests and lumbar puncture, focused on AD diagnosis, cannot precisely
      distinguish the symptoms, or predict their progression at onset time. We analyzed
      acoustic markers, aiming to discriminate lvPPA and AD as well as the influence of
      AD biomarkers on acoustic profiles at the beginning of the disease. We recruited 
      people with AD (n = 8) and with lvPPA (n = 8), with cerebrospinal fluid biomarker
      profiles determined by lumbar puncture. The participants performed a sentence
      repetition task that allows assessing potential lvPPA phonological loop deficits.
      We found that temporal and prosodic markers significantly differentiate the lvPPA
      and AD group at an early stage of the disease. Biomarker and acoustic profile
      comparisons discriminated the two lvPPA subgroups according to their biomarkers. 
      For lvPPA with AD biomarkers, acoustic profile equivalent to an atypical AD form 
      with a specific alteration of the phonological loop is shown. However, lvPPA
      without AD biomarkers has an acoustic profile approximating the one for DLFT.
      Therefore, these results allow us to classify lvPPA differentially from AD based 
      on acoustic markers from a sentence repetition task. Furthermore, our results
      suggest that acoustic analysis would constitute a clinically efficient
      alternative to refused lumbar punctures. It offers the possibility to facilitate 
      early, specific, and accessible neurodegenerative diagnosis and may ease early
      care with speech therapy, preventing the progression of symptoms.

TI  - Regression-Based Normative Data for the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and 
      Its Memory Index Score (MoCA-MIS) for Individuals Aged 18-91.
LID - 4059 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcm11144059 [doi]
AB  - (1) Background: There is a need for a brief assessment of cognitive function,
      both in patient care and scientific research, for which the Montreal Cognitive
      Assessment (MoCA) is a psychometrically reliable and valid tool. However,
      fine-grained normative data allowing for adjustment for age, education, and/or
      sex are lacking, especially for its Memory Index Score (MIS). (2) Methods: A
      total of 820 healthy individuals aged 18-91 (366 men) completed the Dutch MoCA
      (version 7.1), of whom 182 also completed the cued recall and recognition memory 
      subtests enabling calculation of the MIS. Regression-based normative data were
      computed for the MoCA Total Score and MIS, following the data-handling procedure 
      of the Advanced Neuropsychological Diagnostics Infrastructure (ANDI). (3)
      Results: Age, education level, and sex were significant predictors of the MoCA
      Total Score (Conditional R(2) = 0.4, Marginal R(2) = 0.12, restricted maximum
      likelihood (REML) criterion at convergence: 3470.1) and MIS (Marginal R(2) =
      0.14, REML criterion at convergence: 682.8). Percentile distributions are
      presented that allow for age, education and sex adjustment for the MoCA Total
      Score and the MIS. (4) Conclusions: We present normative data covering the full
      adult life span that can be used for the screening for overall cognitive deficits
      and memory impairment, not only in older people with or people at risk of
      neurodegenerative disease, but also in younger individuals with acquired brain
      injury, neurological disease, or non-neurological medical conditions.

TI  - miR-143-3p Inhibits Aberrant Tau Phosphorylation and Amyloidogenic Processing of 
      APP by Directly Targeting DAPK1 in Alzheimer's Disease.
LID - 7992 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23147992 [doi]
AB  - The neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by intracellular 
      aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau and extracellular accumulation of
      beta-amyloid (Abeta). Death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1), as a novel
      therapeutic target, shows promise for the treatment of human AD, but the
      regulatory mechanisms of DAPK1 expression in AD remain unclear. In this study, we
      identified miR-143-3p as a promising candidate for targeting DAPK1. miR-143-3p
      directly bound to the 3' untranslated region of human DAPK1 mRNA and inhibited
      its translation. miR-143-3p decreased tau phosphorylation and promoted neurite
      outgrowth and microtubule assembly. Moreover, miR-143-3p attenuated amyloid
      precursor protein (APP) phosphorylation and reduced the generation of Abeta40 and
      Abeta42. Furthermore, restoring DAPK1 expression with miR-143-3p antagonized the 
      effects of miR-143-3p in attenuating tau hyperphosphorylation and Abeta
      production. In addition, the miR-143-3p levels were downregulated and correlated 
      inversely with the expression of DAPK1 in the hippocampus of AD patients. Our
      results suggest that miR-143-3p might play critical roles in regulating both
      aberrant tau phosphorylation and amyloidogenic processing of APP by targeting
      DAPK1 and thus offer a potential novel therapeutic strategy for AD.

TI  - Is There a Connection between the Metabolism of Copper, Sulfur, and Molybdenum in
      Alzheimer's Disease? New Insights on Disease Etiology.
LID - 7935 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23147935 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other forms of dementia was ranked 3rd in both the
      Americas and Europe in 2019 in a World Health Organization (WHO) publication
      listing the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Copper (Cu)
      imbalance has been reported in AD and increasing evidence suggests metal
      imbalance, including molybdenum (Mo), as a potential link with AD occurrence.We
      conducted an extensive literature review of the last 60 years of research on AD
      and its relationship with Cu, sulfur (S), and Mo at out of range
      levels.Weanalyzed the interactions among metallic elements' metabolisms;Cu and Mo
      are biological antagonists, Mo is a sulfite oxidase and xanthine oxidase
      co-factor, and their low activities impair S metabolism and reduce uric acid,
      respectively. We found significant evidence in the literature of a new potential 
      mechanism linking Cu imbalance to Mo and S abnormalities in AD etiology: under
      certain circumstances, the accumulation of Cu not bound to ceruloplasmin might
      affect the transport of Mo outside the blood vessels, causing a mild Mo
      deficiency that might lowerthe activity of Mo and S enzymes essential for
      neuronal activity. The current review provides an updated discussion of the
      plausible mechanisms combining Cu, S, and Mo alterations in AD.

TI  - Prognosis of Alzheimer's Disease Using Quantitative Mass Spectrometry of Human
      Blood Plasma Proteins and Machine Learning.

LID - 10.3390/ijms23147907 [doi]
AB  - Early recognition of the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) onset is a global
      challenge that requires the development of reliable and affordable screening
      methods for wide-scale application. Proteomic studies of blood plasma are of
      particular relevance; however, the currently proposed differentiating markers are
      poorly consistent. The targeted quantitative multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)
      assay of the reported candidate biomarkers (CBs) can contribute to the creation
      of a consistent marker panel. An MRM-MS analysis of 149 nondepleted EDTA-plasma
      samples (MHRC, Russia) of patients with AD (n = 47), mild cognitive impairment
      (MCI, n = 36), vascular dementia (n = 8), frontotemporal dementia (n = 15), and
      an elderly control group (n = 43) was performed using the BAK 125 kit (MRM
      Proteomics Inc., Canada). Statistical analysis revealed a significant decrease in
      the levels of afamin, apolipoprotein E, biotinidase, and serum
      paraoxonase/arylesterase 1 associated with AD. Different training algorithms for 
      machine learning were performed to identify the protein panels and build
      corresponding classifiers for the AD prognosis. Machine learning revealed 31
      proteins that are important for AD differentiation and mostly include reported
      earlier CBs. The best-performing classifiers reached 80% accuracy, 79.4%
      sensitivity and 83.6% specificity and were able to assess the risk of developing 
      AD over the next 3 years for patients with MCI. Overall, this study demonstrates 
      the high potential of the MRM approach combined with machine learning to confirm 
      the significance of previously identified CBs and to propose consistent protein
      marker panels.

TI  - Identification of Leukocyte Surface P2X7 as a Biomarker Associated with
      Alzheimer's Disease.
LID - 7867 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23147867 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) has shown altered immune responses in the periphery. We 
      studied P2X7 (a proinflammatory receptor and a scavenger receptor) and two
      integrins, CD11b and CD11c, on the surface of circulating leukocytes and analysed
      their associations with Abeta-PET, brain atrophy, neuropsychological assessments,
      and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. Total 287 age-matched, sex-balanced
      participants were recruited in a discovery cohort and two validation cohorts
      through the AIBL study and studied using tri-colour flow cytometry. Our results
      demonstrated reduced expressions of P2X7, CD11b, and CD11c on leukocytes,
      particularly monocytes, in Abeta +ve cases compared with Abeta -ve controls. P2X7
      and integrin downregulation was observed at pre-clinical stage of AD and stayed
      low throughout disease course. We further constructed a polygenic risk score
      (PRS) model based on 12 P2RX7 risk alleles to assess the genetic impact on P2X7
      function in AIBL and ADNI cohorts. No significant association was identified
      between the P2RX7 gene and AD, indicating that P2X7 downregulation in AD is
      likely caused by environmental changes rather than genetic factors. In
      conclusion, the downregulation of P2X7 and integrins at pre-clinical stage of AD 
      indicates altered pro-inflammatory responses, phagocytic functions, and migrating
      capabilities of circulating monocytes in early AD pathogenesis. Our study not
      only improves our understanding of peripheral immune involvement in early stage
      of AD but also provides more insights into novel biomarker development,
      diagnosis, and prognosis of AD.

TI  - Trace Amine Associate Receptor 1 (TAAR1) as a New Target for the Treatment of
      Cognitive Dysfunction in Alzheimer's Disease.
LID - 7811 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23147811 [doi]
AB  - Worldwide, approximately 27 million people are affected by Alzheimer's disease
      (AD). AD pathophysiology is believed to be caused by the deposition of the
      beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta). Abeta can reduce long-term potentiation (LTP), a
      form of synaptic plasticity that is closely associated with learning and memory
      and involves postsynaptic glutamate receptor phosphorylation and trafficking.
      Moreover, Abeta seems to be able to reduce glutamatergic transmission by
      increasing the endocytosis of NMDA receptors. Trace amines (TAs) are biogenic
      amines that are structurally similar to monoamine neurotransmitters. TAs bind to 
      G protein-coupled receptors, called TAARs (trace amine-associated receptors); the
      best-studied member of this family, TAAR1, is distributed in the cortical and
      limbic structures of the CNS. It has been shown that the activation of TAAR1 can 
      rescue glutamatergic hypofunction and that TAAR1 can modulate glutamate NMDA
      receptor-related functions in the frontal cortex. Several lines of evidence also 
      suggest the pro-cognitive action of TAAR1 agonists in various behavioural
      experimental protocols. Thus, we studied, in vitro, the role of the TAAR1 agonist
      RO5256390 on basal cortical glutamatergic transmission and tested its effect on
      Abeta-induced dysfunction. Furthermore, we investigated, in vivo, the role of
      TAAR1 in cognitive dysfunction induced by Abeta infusion in Abeta-treated mice.
      In vitro data showed that Abeta 1-42 significantly decreased NMDA cell surface
      expression while the TAAR1 agonist RO5256390 promoted their membrane insertion in
      cortical cells. In vivo, RO5256390 showed a mild pro-cognitive effect, as
      demonstrated by the better performance in the Y maze test in mice treated with
      Abeta. Further studies are needed to better understand the interplay between
      TAAR1/Abeta and glutamatergic signalling, in order to evaluate the eventual
      beneficial effect in different experimental paradigms and animal models. Taken
      together, our data indicate that TAAR1 agonism may provide a novel therapeutic
      approach in the treatments of disorders involving Abeta-induced cognitive
      impairments, such as AD.

TI  - The Potential Role of miRNA-Regulated Autophagy in Alzheimer's Disease.
LID - 7789 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23147789 [doi]
AB  - As a neurodegenerative disease, Alzheimer's disease (AD) shows a higher incidence
      during the aging process, mainly revealing the characteristics of a significant
      decrease in cognition, uncontrolled emotion, and reduced learning and memory
      capacity, even leading to death. In the prevention and treatment of AD, some
      pharmacological therapy has been applied in clinical practice. Unfortunately,
      there are still limited effective treatments for AD due to the absence of clear
      and defined targets. Currently, it is recognized that the leading causes of AD
      include amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) deposition, hyperphosphorylation of tau
      protein, neurofibrillary tangles, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammation.
      With in-depth mechanistic exploration, it has been found that these causes are
      highly correlated with the dysfunctional status of autophagy. Numerous
      experimental results have also confirmed that the development and progression of 
      AD is accompanied by an abnormal functional status of autophagy; therefore,
      regulating the functional status of autophagy has become one of the important
      strategies for alleviating or arresting the progression of AD. With the
      increasing attention given to microRNAs (miRNAs), more and more studies have
      found that a series of miRNAs are involved in the development and progression of 
      AD through the indirect regulation of autophagy. Therefore, regulating autophagy 
      through targeting these miRNAs may be an essential breakthrough for the
      prevention and treatment of AD. This article summarizes the regulation of miRNAs 
      in autophagy, with the aim of providing a new theoretical reference point for the
      prevention and treatment of AD through the indirect regulation of miRNA-mediated 
      autophagy.

TI  - Dysfunction of Mitochondria in Alzheimer's Disease: ANT and VDAC Interact with
      Toxic Proteins and Aid to Determine the Fate of Brain Cells.
LID - 7722 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23147722 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD), certainly the most widespread proteinopathy, has as
      classical neuropathological hallmarks, two groups of protein aggregates: senile
      plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. However, the research interest is rapidly
      gaining ground in a better understanding of other pathological features, first,
      of all the mitochondrial dysfunctions. Several pieces of evidence support the
      hypothesis that abnormal mitochondrial function may trigger aberrant processing
      of amyloid progenitor protein or tau and thus neurodegeneration. Here, our aim is
      to emphasize the role played by two 'bioenergetic' proteins inserted in the
      mitochondrial membranes, inner and outer, respectively, that is, the adenine
      nucleotide translocator (ANT) and the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), in 
      the progression of AD. To perform this, we will magnify the ANT and VDAC defects,
      which are measurable hallmarks of mitochondrial dysfunction, and collect all the 
      existing information on their interaction with toxic Alzheimer's proteins. The
      pathological convergence of tau and amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) on mitochondria 
      may finally explain why the therapeutic strategies used against the toxic forms
      of Abeta or tau have not given promising results separately. Furthermore, the
      crucial role of ANT-1 and VDAC impairment in the onset/progression of AD opens a 
      window for new therapeutic strategies aimed at preserving/improving mitochondrial
      function, which is suspected to be the driving force leading to plaque and tangle
      deposition in AD.

TI  - Profile of TREM2-Derived circRNA and mRNA Variants in the Entorhinal Cortex of
      Alzheimer's Disease Patients.
LID - 7682 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23147682 [doi]
AB  - Genetic variants in TREM2, a microglia-related gene, are well-known risk factors 
      for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we report that TREM2 originates from circular
      RNAs (circRNAs), a novel class of non-coding RNAs characterized by a covalent and
      stable closed-loop structure. First, divergent primers were designed to amplify
      circRNAs by RT-PCR, which were further assessed by Sanger sequencing. Then,
      additional primer sets were used to confirm back-splicing junctions. In addition,
      HMC3 cells were used to assess the microglial expression of circTREM2s. Three
      candidate circTREM2s were identified in control and AD human entorhinal samples. 
      One of the circRNAs, circTREM2_1, was consistently amplified by all divergent
      primer sets in control and AD entorhinal cortex samples as well as in HMC3 cells.
      In AD cases, a moderate negative correlation (r = -0.434) was found between the
      global average area of Abeta deposits in the entorhinal cortex and circTREM2_1
      expression level. In addition, by bioinformatics tools, a total of 16 miRNAs were
      predicted to join with circTREM2s. Finally, TREM2 mRNA corresponding to four
      isoforms was profiled by RT-qPCR. TREM2 mRNA levels were found elevated in
      entorhinal samples of AD patients with low or intermediate ABC scores compared to
      controls. To sum up, a novel circRNA derived from the TREM2 gene, circTREM2_1,
      has been identified in the human entorhinal cortex and TREM2 mRNA expression has 
      been detected to increase in AD compared to controls. Unraveling the molecular
      genetics of the TREM2 gene may help to better know the innate immune response in 
      AD.

TI  - Increased Acetylcholine Levels and Other Brain Effects in 5XFAD Mice after
      Treatment with 8,14-Dihydroxy Metabolite of Efavirenz.
LID - 7669 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23147669 [doi]
AB  - Efavirenz (EFV), an FDA-approved anti-HIV drug, has off-target binding to
      CYP46A1, the CNS enzyme which converts cholesterol to 24-hydroxycholesterol. At
      small doses, EFV allosterically activates CYP46A1 in mice and humans and
      mitigates some of the Alzheimer's disease manifestations in 5XFAD mice, an animal
      model. Notably, in vitro, all phase 1 EFV hydroxymetabolites activate CYP46A1 as 
      well and bind either to the allosteric site for EFV, neurotransmitters or both.
      Herein, we treated 5XFAD mice with 8,14-dihydroxyEFV, the binder to the
      neurotransmitter allosteric site, which elicits the highest CYP46A1 activation in
      vitro. We found that treated animals of both sexes had activation of CYP46A1 and 
      cholesterol turnover in the brain, decreased content of the amyloid beta 42
      peptide, increased levels of acetyl-CoA and acetylcholine, and altered expression
      of the brain marker proteins. In addition, male mice had improved performance in 
      the Barnes Maze test and increased expression of the acetylcholine-related genes.
      This work expands our knowledge of the beneficial CYP46A1 activation effects and 
      demonstrates that 8,14-dihydroxyEFV crosses the blood-brain barrier and has
      therapeutic potential as a CYP46A1 activator.

TI  - Neuroprotective Effects of Resveratrol by Modifying Cholesterol Metabolism and
      Abeta Processing in SAMP8 Mice.
LID - 7580 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23147580 [doi]
AB  - Cholesterol metabolism seems dysregulated and linked to amyloid-beta (Abeta)
      formation in neurodegeneration, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly known.
      Resveratrol (RSV) is a polyphenol with antioxidant activity and neuroprotective
      properties. Here, we analyzed the effect of age and RSV supplementation on
      cholesterol metabolism in the brain and blood serum, and its potential link to
      Abeta processing, in SAMP8 mice-an animal model of aging and Alzheimer's disease.
      In the brain, our results revealed an age-related increase in ApoE and
      unesterified cholesterol in the plasma membrane whereas LDL receptor, HMG-CoA
      reductase, HMG-CoA-C1 synthase, and ABCA1 transporter remained unaltered.
      Furthermore, BACE-1 and APP gene expression was decreased. This dysregulation
      could be involved in the amyloidogenic processing pathway of APP towards Abeta
      formation. In turn, RSV exhibited an age-dependent effect. While levels of
      unesterified cholesterol in the plasma membrane were not affected by RSV, several
      participants in cholesterol uptake, release, and de novo synthesis differed,
      depending on age. Thus, RSV supplementation exhibited a different neuroprotective
      effect acting on Abeta processing or cholesterol metabolism in the brain at
      earlier or later ages, respectively. In blood serum, HDL lipoprotein and free
      cholesterol were increased by age, whereas VLDL and LDL lipoproteins remained
      unaltered. Again, the protective effect of RSV by decreasing the LDL or
      increasing the HDL levels also seems to depend on the intervention's moment. In
      conclusion, age is a prominent factor for cholesterol metabolism dysregulation in
      the brain of SAMP8 mice and influences the protective effects of RSV through
      cholesterol metabolism and Abeta processing.

TI  - Altered Balance of Reelin Proteolytic Fragments in the Cerebrospinal Fluid of
      Alzheimer's Disease Patients.
LID - 7522 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23147522 [doi]
AB  - Reelin binds to the apolipoprotein E receptor apoER2 to activate an intracellular
      signaling cascade. The proteolytic cleavage of reelin follows receptor binding
      but can also occur independently of its binding to receptors. This study assesses
      whether reelin proteolytic fragments are differentially affected in the
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects. CSF reelin
      species were analyzed by Western blotting, employing antibodies against the N-
      and C-terminal domains. In AD patients, we found a decrease in the 420 kDa
      full-length reelin compared with controls. In these patients, we also found an
      increase in the N-terminal 310 kDa fragment resulting from the cleavage at the
      so-called C-t site, whereas the 180 kDa fragment originated from the N-t site
      remained unchanged. Regarding the C-terminal proteolytic fragments, the 100 kDa
      fragment resulting from the cleavage at the C-t site also displayed increased
      levels, whilst the one resulting from the N-t site, the 250 kDa fragment,
      decreased. We also detected the presence of an aberrant reelin species with a
      molecular mass of around 500 kDa present in AD samples (34 of 43 cases), while it
      was absent in the 14 control cases analyzed. These 500 kDa species were only
      immunoreactive to N-terminal antibodies. We validated the occurrence of these
      aberrant reelin species in an Abeta42-treated reelin-overexpressing cell model.
      When we compared the AD samples from APOE genotype subgroups, we only found minor
      differences in the levels of reelin fragments associated to the APOE genotype,
      but interestingly, the levels of fragments of apoER2 were lower in APOE epsilon4 
      carriers with regards to APOE epsilon3/epsilon3. The altered proportion of
      reelin/apoER2 fragments and the occurrence of reelin aberrant species suggest a
      complex regulation of the reelin signaling pathway, which results impaired in AD 
      subjects.

TI  - Examine Race/Ethnicity Disparities in Perception, Intention, and Screening of
      Dementia in a Community Setting: Scoping Review.
LID - 8865 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19148865 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Delayed detection and diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease and related
      dementia (ADRD) can lead to suboptimal care and socioeconomic burdens on
      individuals, families, and communities. Our objective is to investigate dementia 
      screening behavior focusing on minority older populations and assess whether
      there are ethnic differences in ADRD screening behavior. METHODS: The scoping
      review method was utilized to examine ADRD screening behavior and contributing
      factors for missed and delayed screening/diagnosis focusing on race/ethnicity.
      RESULTS: 2288 papers were identified, of which 21 met the inclusion criteria. We 
      identified six dimensions of ADRD screening behavior: Noticing Symptoms,
      Recognizing a problem, Accepting Screen, Intending Screen, Action, and
      Integrating with time. Final findings were organized into study race/ethnicity,
      theoretical background, the methods of quantitative and qualitative studies,
      description and measures of ADRD screening behavior, and racial/ethnic
      differences in ADRD screening behavior. CONCLUSIONS: A trend in ethnic
      disparities in screening for ADRD was observed. Our findings point to the fact
      that there is a scarcity of studies focusing on describing ethnic-specific ADRD
      screening behavior as well as a lack of those examining the impact of ethnicity
      on ADRD screening behavior, especially studies where Asian Americans are almost
      invisible.

TI  - Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Mediates the Association between Traumatic World
      Trade Center Dust Cloud Exposure and Ongoing Systemic Inflammation in Community
      Members.
LID - 8622 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19148622 [doi]
AB  - Exposure to World Trade Center (WTC) dust/fumes and traumas on 11 September 2001 
      has been reported as a risk factor for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and 
      other mental/physical health symptoms in WTC-affected populations. Increased
      systemic inflammation and oxidative stress from the exposure and subsequent
      illnesses have been proposed as contributors to the underlying biological
      processes. Many blood-based biomarkers of systemic inflammation, including
      C-reactive protein (CRP), are useful for non-invasive diagnostic and monitoring
      of disease process, and also potential targets for therapeutic interventions.
      Twenty years after 9/11, however, the relationships between WTC exposure, chronic
      PTSD, and systemic inflammation are only beginning to be systematically
      investigated in the WTC-affected civilian population despite the fact that
      symptoms of PTSD and systemic inflammation are still common and persistent. This 
      paper aims to address this knowledge gap, using enrollees of the WTC
      Environmental Health Center (EHC), a federally designated treatment and
      surveillance program for community members (WTC Survivors) exposed to the 9/11
      terrorist attack. We conducted a mediation analysis to investigate the
      association between acute WTC dust cloud traumatic exposure (WDCTE) on 9/11,
      chronic PTSD symptoms, and levels of systemic inflammation. The data indicate
      that the chronic PTSD symptoms and some specific symptom clusters of PTSD
      significantly mediate the WDCTE on systemic inflammation, as reflected by the CRP
      levels. As both chronic PTSD and systemic inflammation are long-term risk factors
      for neurodegeneration and cognitive decline, further research on the implications
      of this finding is warranted.

TI  - Sleep Quality and Aging: A Systematic Review on Healthy Older People, Mild
      Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease.

AB  - Aging is characterized by changes in the structure and quality of sleep. When the
      alterations in sleep become substantial, they can generate or accelerate
      cognitive decline, even in the absence of overt pathology. In fact, impaired
      sleep represents one of the earliest symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This
      systematic review aimed to analyze the studies on sleep quality in aging, also
      considering mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. The review process was
      conducted according to the PRISMA statement. A total of 71 studies were included,
      and the whole sample had a mean age that ranged from 58.3 to 93.7 years
      (62.8-93.7 healthy participants and 61.8-86.7 pathological populations). Of these
      selected studies, 33 adopt subjective measurements, 31 adopt objective measures, 
      and 10 studies used both. Pathological aging showed a worse impoverishment of
      sleep than older adults, in both subjective and objective measurements. The most 
      common aspect compromised in AD and MCI were REM sleep, sleep efficiency, sleep
      latency, and sleep duration. These results underline that sleep alterations are
      associated with cognitive impairment. In conclusion, the frequency and severity
      of sleep disturbance appear to follow the evolution of cognitive impairment. The 
      overall results of objective measures seem more consistent than those highlighted
      by subjective measurements.

AB  - Extracellular plaques composed of the hydrophobic peptide amyloid-beta and
      intraneuronal accumulation of the hyperphosphorylated protein tau (p-tau) are
      pathological hallmarks found in the brains of most people affected by Alzheimer's
      disease (AD). In Parkinson's disease (PD), Lewy bodies, i.e., intraneuronal
      protein deposits comprising the protein alpha-synuclein, are a typical disease
      feature. As these hallmarks located in the brain are hardly traceable, reliable
      biomarkers from easily accessible body fluids are key for accurate diagnosis. The
      aim of the present work was to review the available literature regarding
      potential biomarkers of AD and PD in the saliva. The databases PubMed, Google
      Scholar, LILACS, LIVIVO, VHL regional portal, Cochrane Library, eLIBRARY, and IOS
      Press were consulted for the literature search. Screening of titles and abstracts
      followed the PRISMA guidelines, while data extraction and the assessment of full 
      texts were carried out in accordance with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale assessment. 
      The review shows significant increases in levels of the amyloid-beta Abeta1-42
      and elevated p-tau to total tau (t-tau) ratios in salivary samples of AD
      patients, in comparison with healthy controls. In PD patients, levels of
      alpha-synuclein in salivary samples significantly decreased compared to healthy
      controls, whereas oligomeric alpha-synuclein and the ratio of oligomeric
      alpha-synuclein to total alpha-synuclein markedly increased. Salivary biomarkers 
      represent a promising diagnostic tool for neurodegenerative diseases. Further
      high-quality case-control studies are needed to substantiate their accuracy.

TI  - Muramyl Dipeptide Administration Delays Alzheimer's Disease Physiopathology via
      NOD2 Receptors.
LID - 2241 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/cells11142241 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the world. The
      prevalence is steadily increasing due to an aging population and the lack of
      effective treatments. However, modulation of innate immune cells is a new
      therapeutic avenue, which is quite effective at delaying disease onset and
      improving cognitive decline. METHODS: We studied the effect of the NOD2 receptor 
      ligand muramyl dipeptide (MDP) on the modulation of the innate immune cells,
      namely patrolling monocytes and microglia. We administrated MDP once a week for 3
      months in an APPswe/PS1 mouse model in both sexes. We started the treatment at 3 
      months before plaque formation and evaluated its effects at 6 months. RESULTS: We
      showed that the MDP injections delay cognitive decline in both sexes via
      different mechanisms and protect the blood brain barrier (BBB). In males, MDP
      triggers the sink effect from the BBB, leading to a diminution in the amyloid
      load in the brain. This phenomenon is underlined by the increased expression of
      phagocytosis markers such as TREM2, CD68, and LAMP2 and a higher expression of
      ABCB1 and LRP1 at the BBB level. The beneficial effect seems more restricted to
      the brain in females treated with MDP, where microglia surround amyloid plaques
      and prevent the spreading of amyloid peptides. This phenomenon is also associated
      with an increase in TREM2 expression. Interestingly, both treated groups showed
      an increase in Arg-1 expression compared to controls, suggesting that MDP
      modulates the inflammatory response. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that
      stimulation of the NOD2 receptor in innate immune cells is a promising
      therapeutic avenue with potential different mechanisms between males and females.

TI  - NLRP1 Inflammasome Activation in the Hippocampal Formation in Alzheimer's
      Disease: Correlation with Neuropathological Changes and Unbiasedly Estimated
      Neuronal Loss.
LID - 2223 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/cells11142223 [doi]
AB  - Neuroinflammation is one of the core pathological features of Alzheimer's disease
      (AD) as both amyloid beta (Abeta) and tau monomers and oligomers can trigger the 
      long-term pro-inflammatory phenotype of microglial cells with consequent
      overactivation of the inflammasomes. To investigate the NLRP1 inflammasome
      activation in AD, we analyzed the expression of NLRP1, ASC, cleaved gasdermin
      (cGSDMD), and active caspase-6 (CASP-6) proteins in each hippocampal subdivision 
      (hilar part of CA3, CA2/3, CA1, subiculum) of postmortem tissue of 9 cognitively 
      healthy controls (HC) and 11 AD patients whose disease duration varied from 3 to 
      7 years after the clinical diagnosis. The total number of neurons, along with the
      total number of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), were estimated in Nissl- and
      adjacent modified Bielschowsky-stained sections, respectively, using the optical 
      disector method. The same 9 HC and 11 AD cases were additionally
      semiquantitatively analyzed for expression of IBA1, HLA-DR, and CD68 microglial
      markers. Our results show that the expression of NLRP1, ASC, and CASP-6 is
      present in a significantly greater number of hippocampal formation neurons in AD 
      brains compared to controls, suggesting that the NLRP1 inflammasome is more
      active in the AD brain. None of the investigated inflammasome and microglial
      markers were found to correlate with the age of the subjects or the duration of
      AD. However, besides positive correlations with microglial IBA1 expression in the
      subiculum and with microglial CD68 expression in the CA1 field and subiculum in
      the AD group, the overall NLRP1 expression in the hippocampal formation was
      positively correlated with the number of NFTs, thus providing a causal link
      between neuroinflammation and neurofibrillary degeneration. The accumulation of
      AT8-immunoreactive phosphorylated tau proteins that we observed at nuclear pores 
      of large pyramidal neurons of the Ammon's horn further supports their role in the
      extent of neuronal dysfunction and degeneration in AD. This is important because 
      unlike fibrillar amyloid-beta deposits that are not related to dementia severity,
      total NFTs and neuron numbers in the hippocampal formation, especially in the CA1
      field, are the best correlates of cognitive deterioration in both human brain
      aging and AD. Our findings also support the notion that the CA2 field
      vulnerability is strongly linked to specific susceptibilities to different
      tauopathies, including primary age-related tauopathy. Altogether, these findings 
      contrast with reports of nonsignificant microglial activation in aged nonhuman
      primates and indicate that susceptibility to inflammasome activation may render
      the human brain comparatively more vulnerable to neurodegenerative changes and
      AD. In conclusion, our results confirm a key role of NLRP1 inflammasome in AD
      pathogenesis and suggest NLRP1 as a potential diagnostic marker and therapeutic
      target to slow or prevent AD progression.

LID - 10.3390/cells11142219 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies have successfully identified variants
      associated with multiple conditions. However, generalizing discoveries across
      diverse populations remains challenging due to large variations in genetic
      composition. Methods that perform gene expression imputation have attempted to
      address the transferability of gene discoveries across populations, but with
      limited success. METHODS: Here, we introduce a pipeline that combines gene
      expression imputation with gene module discovery, including a dense gene module
      search and a gene set variation analysis, to address the transferability issue.
      Our method feeds association probabilities of imputed gene expression with a
      selected phenotype into tissue-specific gene-module discovery over protein
      interaction networks to create higher-level gene modules. RESULTS: We demonstrate
      our method's utility in three case-control studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD)
      for three different race/ethnic populations (Whites, African descent and
      Hispanics). We discovered 182 AD-associated genes from gene modules shared
      between these populations, highlighting new gene modules associated with AD.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our innovative framework has the potential to identify robust
      discoveries across populations based on gene modules, as demonstrated in AD.

TI  - Modulation of MAPK- and PI3/AKT-Dependent Autophagy Signaling by Stavudine (D4T) 
      in PBMC of Alzheimer's Disease Patients.
LID - 2180 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/cells11142180 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Abeta42 deposition plays a pivotal role in AD pathogenesis by
      inducing the activation of microglial cells and neuroinflammation. This process
      is antagonized by microglia-mediated clearance of Abeta plaques. Activation of
      the NLRP3 inflammasome is involved in neuroinflammation and in the impairments of
      Abeta-plaque clearance. On the other hand, stavudine (D4T) downregulates the
      NLRP3 inflammasome and stimulates autophagy-mediated Abeta-clearing in a
      THP-1-derived macrophages. METHODS: We explored the effect of D4T on Abeta
      autophagy in PBMC from AD patients that were primed with LPS and stimulated with 
      Abeta oligomers in the absence/presence of D4T. We analyzed the NLRP3 activity by
      measuring NLRP3-ASC complex formation by AMNIS FlowSight and pro-inflammatory
      cytokine (IL-1beta, IL-18 and Caspase-1) production by ELISA. The phosphorylation
      status of p38, ERK, AKT, p70, and the protein expression of CREB, LAMP2A,
      beclin-1, Caspase-3 and Bcl2 were analyzed by Western blot. RESULTS: Data showed 
      that D4T: (1) downregulates NLRP3 inflammasome activation and the production of
      down-stream pro-inflammatory cytokines in PBMC; (2) stimulates the
      phosphorylation of AKT, ERK and p70 as well as LAMP2A, beclin-1 and Bcl2
      expression and reduces Caspase-3 expression, suggesting an effect of this
      compound on autophagy; (3) increases phospho-CREB, which is a downstream target
      of p-ERK and p-AKT, inducing anti-inflammatory cytokine production and resulting 
      in a possible decrease of Abeta-mediated cytotoxicity; and (4) reduces the
      phosphorylation of p38, a protein involved in the production of pro-inflammatory 
      cytokines and tau hyperphosphorylation. CONCLUSIONS: D4T reduces the activation
      of the NLRP3 inflammasome, and it might stimulate autophagy as well as the
      molecular mechanism that modulates Abeta cytotoxicity, and D4T might reduce
      inflammation in the cells of AD patients. It could be very interesting to check
      the possible beneficial effects of D4T in the clinical scenario.

TI  - Upregulated Ca(2+) Release from the Endoplasmic Reticulum Leads to Impaired
      Presynaptic Function in Familial Alzheimer's Disease.
LID - 2167 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/cells11142167 [doi]
AB  - Neurotransmitter release from presynaptic terminals is primarily regulated by
      rapid Ca(2+) influx through membrane-resident voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels
      (VGCCs). Moreover, accumulating evidence indicates that the endoplasmic reticulum
      (ER) is extensively present in axonal terminals of neurons and plays a modulatory
      role in synaptic transmission by regulating Ca(2+) levels. Familial Alzheimer's
      disease (FAD) is marked by enhanced Ca(2+) release from the ER and downregulation
      of Ca(2+) buffering proteins. However, the precise consequence of impaired Ca(2+)
      signaling within the vicinity of VGCCs (active zone (AZ)) on exocytosis is poorly
      understood. Here, we perform in silico experiments of intracellular Ca(2+)
      signaling and exocytosis in a detailed biophysical model of hippocampal synapses 
      to investigate the effect of aberrant Ca(2+) signaling on neurotransmitter
      release in FAD. Our model predicts that enhanced Ca(2+) release from the ER
      increases the probability of neurotransmitter release in FAD. Moreover, over very
      short timescales (30-60 ms), the model exhibits activity-dependent and enhanced
      short-term plasticity in FAD, indicating neuronal hyperactivity-a hallmark of the
      disease. Similar to previous observations in AD animal models, our model reveals 
      that during prolonged stimulation (~450 ms), pathological Ca(2+) signaling
      increases depression and desynchronization with stimulus, causing affected
      synapses to operate unreliably. Overall, our work provides direct evidence in
      support of a crucial role played by altered Ca(2+) homeostasis mediated by
      intracellular stores in FAD.

TI  - WWOX Controls Cell Survival, Immune Response and Disease Progression by pY33 to
      pS14 Transition to Alternate Signaling Partners.
LID - 2137 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/cells11142137 [doi]
AB  - Tumor suppressor WWOX inhibits cancer growth and retards Alzheimer's disease (AD)
      progression. Supporting evidence shows that the more strongly WWOX binds
      intracellular protein partners, the weaker is cancer cell growth in vivo. Whether
      this correlates with retardation of AD progression is unknown. Two functional
      forms of WWOX exhibit opposite functions. pY33-WWOX is proapoptotic and
      anticancer, and is essential for maintaining normal physiology. In contrast,
      pS14-WWOX is accumulated in the lesions of cancers and AD brains, and suppression
      of WWOX phosphorylation at S14 by a short peptide Zfra abolishes cancer growth
      and retardation of AD progression. In parallel, synthetic Zfra4-10 or WWOX7-21
      peptide strengthens the binding of endogenous WWOX with intracellular protein
      partners leading to cancer suppression. Indeed, Zfra4-10 is potent in restoring
      memory loss in triple transgenic mice for AD (3xTg) by blocking the aggregation
      of amyloid beta 42 (Abeta42), enhancing degradation of aggregated proteins, and
      inhibiting activation of inflammatory NF-kappaB. In light of the findings,
      Zfra4-10-mediated suppression of cancer and AD is due, in part, to an enhanced
      binding of endogenous WWOX and its binding partners. In this perspective review
      article, we detail the molecular action of WWOX in the HYAL-2/WWOX/SMAD4
      signaling for biological effects, and discuss WWOX phosphorylation forms in
      interacting with binding partners, leading to suppression of cancer growth and
      retardation of AD progression.

TI  - Immunohistochemical Demonstration of the pGlu79 alpha-Synuclein Fragment in
      Alzheimer's Disease and Its Tg2576 Mouse Model.
LID - 1006 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biom12071006 [doi]
AB  - The deposition of beta-amyloid peptides and of alpha-synuclein proteins is a
      neuropathological hallmark in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and
      Parkinson's disease (PD) subjects, respectively. However, there is accumulative
      evidence that both proteins are not exclusive for their clinical entity but
      instead co-exist and interact with each other. Here, we investigated the presence
      of a newly identified, pyroglutamate79-modified alpha-synuclein variant
      (pGlu79-aSyn)-along with the enzyme matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) and
      glutaminyl cyclase (QC) implicated in its formation-in AD and in the transgenic
      Tg2576 AD mouse model. In the human brain, pGlu79-aSyn was detected in cortical
      pyramidal neurons, with more distinct labeling in AD compared to control brain
      tissue. Using immunohistochemical double and triple labelings and confocal laser 
      scanning microscopy, we demonstrate an association of pGlu79-aSyn, MMP-3 and QC
      with beta-amyloid plaques. In addition, pGlu79-aSyn and QC were present in
      amyloid plaque-associated reactive astrocytes that were also immunoreactive for
      the chaperone heat shock protein 27 (HSP27). Our data are consistent for the
      transgenic mouse model and the human clinical condition. We conclude that
      pGlu79-aSyn can be generated extracellularly or within reactive astrocytes,
      accumulates in proximity to beta-amyloid plaques and induces an astrocytic
      protein unfolding mechanism involving HSP27.

TI  - Comparison of Tau and Amyloid-beta Targeted Immunotherapy Nanoparticles for
      Alzheimer's Disease.
LID - 1001 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biom12071001 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a rapidly growing global concern associated with the 
      accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles in
      the brain combined with a high acetylcholinesterase activity. AD diagnosis is
      usually made too late, when patients have an extensive neuronal death, and brain 
      damage is irreversible. Several therapeutic targets have been defined mainly
      related to two hypotheses of AD: the tau hypothesis and the amyloid-beta
      hypothesis. Here, we intend to investigate and to compare different therapeutic
      approaches for AD, mainly based on nanoparticles (NPs) targeted at the brain and 
      at the pathological hallmarks of the disease. We analyzed preclinical trials that
      have successfully improved drug bioavailability in the brain by using targeted
      nanocarriers towards either tau, amyloid-beta, or both. We then compared these
      trials to find out which protein is more efficient in therapeutic targeting. We
      found that the search for a cure was mostly based on the amyloid-beta hypothesis,
      with Abeta dysplasia emerging as the most confirmed and convincing therapeutic
      target. Targeted NPs have proven useful to enhance both the bioavailability and
      the performance of therapies against AD in animal models. A better understanding 
      of AD mechanisms will help the successful application of targeted NPs for
      combined therapies.

TI  - The Role of Tryptophan Dysmetabolism and Quinolinic Acid in Depressive and
      Neurodegenerative Diseases.
LID - 998 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biom12070998 [doi]
AB  - Emerging evidence suggests that neuroinflammation is involved in both depression 
      and neurodegenerative diseases. The kynurenine pathway, generating metabolites
      which may play a role in pathogenesis, is one of several competing pathways of
      tryptophan metabolism. The present article is a narrative review of tryptophan
      metabolism, neuroinflammation, depression, and neurodegeneration. A disturbed
      tryptophan metabolism with increased activity of the kynurenine pathway and
      production of quinolinic acid may result in deficiencies in tryptophan and
      derived neurotransmitters. Quinolinic acid is an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor
      agonist, and raised levels in CSF, together with increased levels of inflammatory
      cytokines, have been reported in mood disorders. Increased quinolinic acid has
      also been observed in neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease, 
      Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and HIV-related cognitive
      decline. Oxidative stress in connection with increased indole-dioxygenase (IDO)
      activity and kynurenine formation may contribute to inflammatory responses and
      the production of cytokines. Increased formation of quinolinic acid may occur at 
      the expense of kynurenic acid and neuroprotective picolinic acid. While awaiting 
      ongoing research on potential pharmacological interventions on tryptophan
      metabolism, adequate protein intake with appropriate amounts of tryptophan and
      antioxidants may offer protection against oxidative stress and provide a balanced
      set of physiological receptor ligands.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease remains a prevailing neurodegenerative condition which has an
      array physical, emotional, and financial consequences to patients and society. In
      the past decade, there has been a greater degree of investigation on therapeutic 
      small peptides. This group of biomolecules have a profile of fundamentally sound 
      characteristics which make them an intriguing area for drug development. Among
      these biomolecules, there are four modulatory mechanisms of interest in this
      review: alpha-, beta-, gamma-secretases, and amylin. These protease-based
      biomolecules all have a contributory role in the amyloid cascade hypothesis.
      Moreover, the involvement of various biochemical pathways intertwines these
      peptides to have shared regulators (i.e., retinoids). Further clinical and
      translational investigation must occur to gain a greater understanding of its
      potential application in patient care. The aim of this narrative review is to
      evaluate the contemporary literature on these protease biomolecule modulators and
      determine its utility in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

TI  - Acute Effects of Focused Ultrasound-Induced Blood-Brain Barrier Opening on
      Anti-Pyroglu3 Abeta Antibody Delivery and Immune Responses.
LID - 951 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biom12070951 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the
      accumulation of amyloid plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau in the brain.
      Currently, therapeutic agents targeting amyloid appear promising for AD, however,
      delivery to the CNS is limited due to the blood-brain-barrier (BBB). Focused
      ultrasound (FUS) is a method to induce a temporary opening of the BBB to enhance 
      the delivery of therapeutic agents to the CNS. In this study, we evaluated the
      acute effects of FUS and whether the use of FUS-induced BBB opening enhances the 
      delivery of 07/2a mAb, an anti-pyroglutamate-3 Abeta antibody, in aged 24 mo-old 
      APP/PS1dE9 transgenic mice. FUS was performed either unilaterally or bilaterally 
      with mAb infusion and the short-term effect was analyzed 4 h and 72 h
      post-treatment. Quantitative analysis by ELISA showed a 5-6-fold increase in
      07/2a mAb levels in the brain at both time points and an increased brain-to-blood
      ratio of the antibody. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated an increase in IgG2a mAb
      detection particularly in the cortex, enhanced immunoreactivity of resident Iba1+
      and phagocytic CD68+ microglial cells, and a transient increase in the
      infiltration of Ly6G+ immune cells. Cerebral microbleeds were not altered in the 
      unilaterally or bilaterally sonicated hemispheres. Overall, this study shows the 
      potential of FUS therapy for the enhanced delivery of CNS therapeutics.

TI  - Modeling the Competition between Misfolded Abeta Conformers That Produce Distinct
      Types of Amyloid Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease.
LID - 886 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biom12070886 [doi]
AB  - The amyloid pathology characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be broadly
      classified as either fibrillary amyloid or diffuse amyloid. Fibrillary amyloid is
      found in cored-neuritic deposits, fibrillar deposits, and vascular deposits, and 
      binds strongly to the amyloid revealing dyes Thioflavin-S or Congo Red. Diffuse
      amyloid can appear as wispy dispersed deposits or compact tufted deposits
      dispersed in neuropil, and binds amyloid dyes weakly if at all. In AD brains,
      both types of pathology are detected. Homogenates from AD brains, or the brains
      of transgenic mice modeling AD-amyloidosis, have been used to seed pathology in
      vulnerable host transgenic models. These studies suggest that pathologies may
      arise from distinct conformers or strains of misfolded Abeta, similar to
      propagating prions. Using Abeta strains sourced from four different
      AD-amyloidosis models, we injected pathological seeds into the brains of newborn 
      mice from three different transgenic hosts with distinctive Abeta pathologies.
      Two of the seeding sources were from mice that primarily develop cored-neuritic
      Abeta deposits (cored strain) while the other two seeding sources were from mice 
      that develop diffuse Abeta deposits (diffuse strain). These seeds were injected
      into host APP mice in which the resident strain was either diffuse or
      cored-neuritic pathology. Seeding-homogenates were injected into the brains of
      newborn mice to initiate propagation as early as possible. Depending upon the
      level of transgene expression in the host, we show that the injected strains of
      misfolded Abeta from the seeding homogenate were able to outcompete the resident 
      strain of the APP host model. In serial passaging experiments, it appeared that
      the diffuse strain was more easily propagated than the cored strain.
      Collectively, our studies align with the idea that different types of Abeta
      pathology in AD brains arise from different populations of Abeta conformers that 
      compete to populate the brain.

TI  - A Novel and Selective Dopamine Transporter Inhibitor, (S)-MK-26, Promotes
      Hippocampal Synaptic Plasticity and Restores Effort-Related Motivational
      Dysfunctions.

AB  - Dopamine (DA), the most abundant human brain catecholaminergic neurotransmitter, 
      modulates key behavioral and neurological processes in young and senescent
      brains, including motricity, sleep, attention, emotion, learning and memory, and 
      social and reward-seeking behaviors. The DA transporter (DAT) regulates
      transsynaptic DA levels, influencing all these processes. Compounds targeting DAT
      (e.g., cocaine and amphetamines) were historically used to shape mood and
      cognition, but these substances typically lead to severe negative side effects
      (tolerance, abuse, addiction, and dependence). DA/DAT signaling dysfunctions are 
      associated with neuropsychiatric and progressive brain disorders, including
      Parkinson's and Alzheimer diseases, drug addiction and dementia, resulting in
      devastating personal and familial concerns and high socioeconomic costs
      worldwide. The development of low-side-effect, new/selective medicaments with
      reduced abuse-liability and which ameliorate DA/DAT-related dysfunctions is
      therefore crucial in the fields of medicine and healthcare. Using the rat as
      experimental animal model, the present work describes the synthesis and
      pharmacological profile of (S)-MK-26, a new modafinil analogue with markedly
      improved potency and selectivity for DAT over parent drug. Ex vivo
      electrophysiology revealed significantly augmented hippocampal long-term synaptic
      potentiation upon acute, intraperitoneally delivered (S)-MK-26 treatment, whereas
      in vivo experiments in the hole-board test showed only lesser effects on
      reference memory performance in aged rats. However, in effort-related FR5/chow
      and PROG/chow feeding choice experiments, (S)-MK-26 treatment reversed the
      depression-like behavior induced by the dopamine-depleting drug tetrabenazine
      (TBZ) and increased the selection of high-effort alternatives. Moreover, in in
      vivo microdialysis experiments, (S)-MK-26 significantly increased extracellular
      DA levels in the prefrontal cortex and in nucleus accumbens core and shell. These
      studies highlight (S)-MK-26 as a potent enhancer of transsynaptic DA and promoter
      of synaptic plasticity, with predominant beneficial effects on effort-related
      behaviors, thus proposing therapeutic potentials for (S)-MK-26 in the treatment
      of low-effort exertion and motivational dysfunctions characteristic of depression
      and aging-related disorders.

AB  - As in neurons, CNS myelin expresses N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors (NMDARs) that 
      subserve physiological roles, but have the potential to induce injury to this
      vital element. Using 2-photon imaging of myelinic Ca in live ex vivo mouse optic 
      nerves, we show that Cu ions potently modulate Ca levels in an NMDAR-dependent
      manner. Chelating Cu in the perfusate induced a substantial increase in Ca
      levels, and also caused significant axo-myelinic injury. Myelinic NMDARs are
      shown to be regulated by cellular prion protein; only in prion protein KO optic
      nerves does application of NMDA + D-serine induce a large Ca increase, consistent
      with strong desensitization of these receptors in the presence of prion protein
      limiting Ca overload. Abeta1-42 peptide induced a large Ca increase that was also
      Cu-dependent, and was blocked by NMDAR antagonism. Our results indicate that like
      in neurons, myelinic NMDARs permeate potentially injurious amounts of Ca, and are
      also potently regulated by micromolar Cu and activated by Abeta1-42 peptides.
      These findings shed mechanistic light on the important primary white matter
      injury frequently observed in Alzheimer's brain.

TI  - Kruppel-like factor 5 accelerates the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease via
      BACE1-mediated APP processing.
PG  - 103
LID - 10.1186/s13195-022-01050-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The deposition of beta-amyloid (Abeta) in the brain plays a major
      role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta is generated via
      amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleavage through the amyloidogenic pathway. In
      this pathway, beta-secretase (BACE1) is the first and rate-limiting enzyme. Its
      expression increases through an unknown mechanism in patients with AD. Thus, the 
      key regulatory mechanism of BACE1 in the AD process should be revealed to
      understand the pathogenesis of AD and explore the key treatment targets of AD.
      METHODS: Here, APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice were employed to observe the
      Kruppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) and BACE1 levels in the serum and brain tissues.
      HT22 cells were used to explore the relationship between KLF5 and BACE1. RESULTS:
      In this study, KLF5 was found to be a novel transcription factor that positively 
      regulated BACE1 by binding to the BACE1 promoter. The KLF5 levels significantly
      increased not only in the CSF and serum of patients with AD but also in the brain
      tissue of APP/PS1 mice. They were closely related to cognitive capacity. KLF5
      accelerated APP amyloidogenic metabolism and promoted Abeta synthesis through
      BACE1. Silencing BACE1 could block the KLF5-induced amyloidogenic process of APP.
      ML264 ameliorated the cognitive deficits and slowed down APP amyloidogenic
      cleavage in APP/PS1 mice. CONCLUSION: The findings above suggest that
      upregulation of KLF5 might be a critical element in AD progression by
      accelerating BACE1-mediated APP amyloidogenic cleavage. The inhibition of KLF5 or
      the combined inhibitory effect of KLF5 and the BACE1 promoter might be a
      potential strategy to prevent AD pathogenesis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Impairment in neurogenesis correlates with memory and cognitive
      dysfunction in AD patients. In the recent decade, therapies with stem cell bases 
      are growing and proved to be efficient. This study is a preliminary attempt to
      explore the impact of NTF-SCs on hippocampal neurogenesis mediated by the
      Wnt/beta-catenin signaling cascade in AD-like mouse brain parenchyma. METHODS:
      The BALB/c mice were divided into four groups: Control, AD +Vehicle, AD+
      TF-SCs-CM and AD+NTF-SCs (n = 10). For AD induction, 100 microM Abeta1-42 was
      injected into lateral ventricles. The AD-like model was confirmed via passive
      avoidance test and Thioflavin-S staining 21 days following Abeta injection. Next,
      NTF-SCs were differentiated from ADMSCs, and both NTF-SCs and supernatant
      (NTF-SCs-CM) were injected into the hippocampus after AD confirmation. Endogenous
      neural stem cells (NSCs) proliferation capacity was assessed after 50 mg/kbW BrdU
      injection for 4 days using immunofluorescence (IF) staining. The percent of
      BrdU/Nestin and BrdU/NeuN positive NSCs were calculated. Real-time RT-PCR was
      used to detect genes related to the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling cascade. The
      spatial learning and memory alternation was evaluated using the Morris water maze
      (MWM). RESULTS: Data showed the reduction in escape latency over 5 days in the AD
      mice compared to the control group. The administration of NTF-SCs and NTF-SCs-CM 
      increased this value compared to the AD-Vehicle group. Both NTF-SCs and
      NTF-SCs-CM were the potential to reduce the cumulative distance to the platform
      in AD mice compared to the AD-Vehicle group. The time spent in target quadrants
      was ameliorated following NTF-SCs and NTF-SCs-CM transplantation followed by an
      improved MWM performance. IF imaging revealed the increase in BrdU/Nestin(+) and 
      BrdU/NeuN(+) in AD mice that received NTF-SCs and NTF-SCs-CM, indicating enhanced
      neurogenesis. Based on real-time PCR analysis, the expression of PI3K, Akt, MAPK,
      ERK, Wnt, and beta-catenin was upregulated and coincided with the suppression of 
      GSK-3beta after injection of NTF-SCs-CM and NTF-SCs. In this study, NTF-SCs had
      superior effects in AD mice that received NTF-SCs compared to NTF-SCs-CM.
      CONCLUSIONS: The activation of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway via NTF-SCs can be touted
      as a possible therapeutic approach to restore neurogenesis in AD mice.

AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate the process of Fe(3+) binding to bLTF.
      Moreover, the physicochemical characterization of the respective supersaturated
      complex was studied. The knowledge should be important for the description of
      processes that may take place in dairy products fortified with iron.
      Additionally, the synthesized complex can be utilized as a dietary supplement for
      the treatment of iron deficiency anemia (IDA). Finally, it was shown that
      formation of supersaturated iron-protein structures which include LTF often
      accompanies development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer or
      Parkinson. Thus, the study can reveal some aspects of its pathogenesis process.
      The methodology of the investigation comprised the utilization of batch sorption 
      study and applying Freundlich and Langmuir models. The complex also was
      characterized by numerous techniques: spectrometric (ICP-MS), spectroscopic
      (UV-Vis, ATR-FTIR), electron microscopy (TEM-EDX), SDS-PAGE. Based on obtained
      results the potential mechanisms of iron interaction with protein were described.
      Moreover, the molecular docking was applied to visualize possible metal binding
      sites. The respective complex contains approximately 33.0 mg/g of iron which is
      nearly 50 Fe(3+) per one protein molecule. The cytotoxicity of the obtained
      complex was evaluated by MTT reduction and LDH release assays on Caco-2 and nL929
      cell lines.

TI  - Temporal Belonging: Loss of Time and Fragile Attempts to Belong with Alzheimer's 
      Disease.
LID - 10.1007/s11013-022-09803-3 [doi]
AB  - Building on 12 months of ethnographic fieldwork among people with Alzheimer's
      disease living in Denmark, I argue that the loss of a sense of time caused by
      Alzheimer's is not a subjective loss, but rather an intersubjective one.
      Alzheimer's disease entails living with desynchronized rhythms, time that can be 
      made painfully explicit, and numbers becoming increasingly tricky to manage.
      Drawing on Thomas Fuchs' theory of how individuals live in "basic
      contemporality," I explore moments of temporal rupture, and how people with
      Alzheimer's challenge their social relations due to their different sense of
      time. The article contributes to ongoing discussions about belonging. Taking
      inspiration from Tine Gammeltoft's description of how belonging entails fragile
      attempts at being part of something larger, and is thus a joint social practice, 
      I show how one dimension of belonging's fragility is the inability to be in synch
      with social time. By proposing the notion of temporal belonging, I suggest that
      sustaining a sense of belonging is also about being able to participate in the
      rhythms and tempo of social life.

TI  - Semi-quantitative Assessment of Alzheimer's-like Pathology in Two Aged Polar
      Bears (Ursus maritimus).
LID - 10.30802/AALAS-CM-22-000036 [doi]
AB  - Age-associated neurodegenerative changes, including amyloid beta(Abeta) plaques, 
      neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and amyloid angiopathy comparable to those seen
      in the brains of human patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), have been reported
      in the brains of aged bears. However, the significance of these findings in bears
      is unclear due to the difficulty in assessing cognitive impairment and the lack
      of standardized approaches for the semiquantitative evaluation of Abeta plaques
      and NFTs. In this study, we evaluate the neuropathologic changes in archival
      brain tissue of 2 aged polar bears (Ursus maritimus, ages 28 and 37) using the
      National Institute of Aging-Alzheimer Association (NIA-AA) consensus guidelines
      for the neuropathologic assessment of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Both bears had an
      Abeta (A) score of 3 of 3, Braak stage (B score) of 2 of 3, and neuritic plaque
      (C) score of 3 of 3. These findings are consistent with the neurodegenerative
      changes observed in brains of patients with AD. The application of NIA-AA
      consensus guidelines, as applied to the neuropathologic assessment of the aged
      bears in this report, demonstrates the use of standardized semiquantitative
      assessment systems for comparative, translational studies of aging in a
      vulnerable wildlife species.

TI  - Genetic inhibition of PDK1 robustly reduces plaque deposition and ameliorates
      gliosis in the 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - e12839
LID - 10.1111/nan.12839 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Abundant recent evidence has shown that 3-phosphoinositide-dependent
      protein kinase 1 (PDK1) is activated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it
      remains unknown whether inhibition of PDK1 in neurons may affect AD-like
      pathology in animal models of AD. Here, we aim to examine the effects of specific
      inactivation of neuronal PDK1 on pathology and behaviour in 5xFAD mice and to
      identify the underlying molecular mechanisms. METHODS: The Cre-loxP system was
      employed to generate Pdk1 cKO/5xFAD mice, in which PDK1 is inactivated in
      excitatory neurons in the adult forebrain. Cellular and behavioural techniques
      were used to examine plaque burden, inflammatory responses and spatial working
      memory in mice. Biochemical and molecular analyses were conducted to investigate 
      relevant mechanisms. RESULTS: First, Abeta deposition was massively decreased and
      gliosis was highly attenuated in Pdk1 cKO/5xFAD mice compared with 5xFAD mice.
      Second, memory deficits were significantly improved in Pdk1 cKO/5xFAD mice.
      Third, APP levels were notably decreased in Pdk1 cKO/5xFAD mice. Fourth,
      mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling and ribosome biogenesis were
      reduced in Pdk1 cKO/5xFAD mice. CONCLUSIONS: Neuron-specific deletion of PDK1
      robustly ameliorates AD-like pathology and improves spatial working memory in
      5xFAD mice. We propose that genetic approach to inhibit PDK1 may be an effective 
      strategy to slow AD.

TI  - Quantitative susceptibility mapping demonstrates different patterns of iron
      overload in subtypes of early-onset Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We aimed to define brain iron distribution patterns in subtypes of
      early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) by the use of quantitative susceptibility 
      mapping (QSM). METHODS: EOAD patients prospectively underwent MRI on a 3-T
      scanner and concomitant clinical and neuropsychological evaluation, between 2016 
      and 2019. An age-matched control group was constituted of cognitively healthy
      participants at risk of developing AD. Volumetry of the hippocampus and cerebral 
      cortex was performed on 3DT1 images. EOAD subtypes were defined according to the 
      hippocampal to cortical volume ratio (HV:CTV). Limbic-predominant atrophy (LPMRI)
      is referred to HV:CTV ratios below the 25(th) percentile, hippocampal-sparing
      (HpSpMRI) above the 75(th) percentile, and typical-AD between the 25(th) and
      75(th) percentile. Brain iron was estimated using QSM. QSM analyses were made
      voxel-wise and in 7 regions of interest within deep gray nuclei and limbic
      structures. Iron distribution in EOAD subtypes and controls was compared using an
      ANOVA. RESULTS: Sixty-eight EOAD patients and 43 controls were evaluated. QSM
      values were significantly higher in deep gray nuclei (p < 0.001) and limbic
      structures (p = 0.04) of EOAD patients compared to controls. Among EOAD subtypes,
      HpSpMRI had the highest QSM values in deep gray nuclei (p < 0.001) whereas the
      highest QSM values in limbic structures were observed in LPMRI (p = 0.005). QSM
      in deep gray nuclei had an AUC = 0.92 in discriminating HpSpMRI and controls.
      CONCLUSIONS: In early-onset Alzheimer's disease patients, we observed significant
      variations of iron distribution reflecting the pattern of brain atrophy. Iron
      overload in deep gray nuclei could help to identify patients with atypical
      presentation of Alzheimer's disease. KEY POINTS: * In early-onset AD patients,
      QSM indicated a significant brain iron overload in comparison with age-matched
      controls. * Iron load in limbic structures was higher in participants with
      limbic-predominant subtype. * Iron load in deep nuclei was more important in
      participants with hippocampal-sparing subtype.

TI  - Tau mediates synergistic influence of vascular risk and Abeta on cognitive
      decline.
LID - 10.1002/ana.26460 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Elevated vascular risk and amyloid-beta (Abeta) burden have been
      synergistically associated with cognitive decline in preclinical Alzheimer's
      disease (AD), though the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We examined
      whether accelerated longitudinal tau accumulation mediates the vascular
      risk-Abeta interaction on cognitive decline. METHODS: We included 175 cognitively
      unimpaired older adults (age 70.5+/-8.0y). Baseline vascular risk was quantified 
      using the office-based Framingham Heart Study general cardiovascular disease risk
      score (FHS-CVD). Baseline Abeta burden was measured with Pittsburgh Compound-B
      PET. Tau burden was measured longitudinally (3.6+/-1.5y) with Flortaucipir PET,
      focusing on inferior temporal cortex (ITC). Cognition was assessed longitudinally
      (7.0+/-2.0y) using the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite. Linear mixed
      effects models examined the interactive effects of baseline vascular risk and
      Abeta on longitudinal ITC tau. Additionally, moderated mediation was used to
      determine whether tau accumulation mediated the FHS-CVD*Abeta effect on cognitive
      decline. RESULTS: We observed a significant interaction between elevated baseline
      FHS-CVD and Abeta on greater ITC tau accumulation (p=0.004), even in individuals 
      with Abeta burden below the conventional threshold for amyloid-positivity.
      Examining individual vascular risk factors, we found elevated systolic blood
      pressure and body mass index showed independent interactions with Abeta on
      longitudinal tau (both p<0.0001). ITC tau accumulation mediated 33% of the
      interactive association of FHS-CVD and Abeta on cognitive decline.
      INTERPRETATION: Vascular risks interact with subthreshold levels of Abeta to
      promote cognitive decline, partially by accelerating early neocortical tau
      accumulation. Our findings support vascular risk reduction, especially treating
      hypertension and obesity, to attenuate Abeta-related tau pathology and reduce
      late-life cognitive decline. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

TI  - The engineered probiotics for the treatment of chronic diseases: A systematic
      review.
PG  - e14343
LID - 10.1111/jfbc.14343 [doi]
AB  - Engineered probiotics (EPs) are a group of probiotics whose proteome is
      manipulated by biotechnological techniques. EPs have attracted a lot of attention
      in recent researches for preventing and treating chronic diseases. The current
      study has been conducted to provide an overview regarding the EPs application in 
      the treatment of chronic disease by a comprehensive systematic review of the
      published articles up to January 2022. To retrieve the related publications,
      three databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Sciences, and Scopus) were searched
      systematically. Finally, all human (n = 2) and animal (n = 37) studies were
      included. The included articles evaluated the effects of EPs on treatment of
      arthritis (n = 3), cancer (n = 2), autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE; n = 6),
      Parkinson disease (PD; n = 1), Alzheimer diseases (AD; n = 1), colitis (n = 11), 
      celiac disease (n = 1), diabetes (n = 8) and cardiovascular disease (CVD; n = 6).
      Induction of oral tolerance (OT) is the most important mechanism of EPs action in
      the treatment of chronic disease. Providing oral vaccine and bioactive compounds 
      are the other mechanisms of EPs action. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The current
      systematic review gathered evidence about the application of EPs in the treatment
      of chronic diseases. Evidence suggests that EPs have very broad and potent
      effects in the treatment of chronic and even genetic diseases.

PG  - 573-9
LID - 10.13702/j.1000-0607.20211346 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of pre-moxibustion at "Baihui"(GV20),
      "Shenshu"(BL23) and "Zusanli"(ST36) on expression of Tau protein and related
      protein kinases as glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta), etc. in the
      hippocampal CA3 region of Alzheimer's disease (AD) rats, so as to explore its
      mechanism underlying prevention and treatment of AD cognitive impairment.
      METHODS: Male SD rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: normal control, sham
      operation model and pre-moxibustionwith 9 rats in each group. Rats of the
      pre-moxibustion group received moxibustion of GV20, BL23 and ST36 for 15 min,
      once a day, 6 days a week for 3 weeks. After completion of moxibustion, the AD
      model was reproduced by injection of amyloid beta-peptide 25-35(Abeta 25-35)
      aggregation solution 1 muL (5 mug/muL) into the bilateral hippocampus, rats of
      the sham operation group received injection of the same dose of normal saline
      into the hippocampus. The spatial learning-memory ability was detected using
      Morris water maze test, and changes of the ultrastructure of hippocampal neurons 
      were observed using electron microscope, and those of histopathological changes
      of hippocampus tissue observed using hematoxylin eosin (H.E.) staining. The
      expression levels of hippocampal GSK-3beta, p-Tau, CDK5 and Synapsin I proteins
      were detected by Western blot and immunohistochemistry, respectively. RESULTS: No
      significances were found between the normal control and sham groups in all the
      indexes (P>0.05). Compared with the control group, the escape latency of place
      navigation test of Morris water maze test, expression of GSK-3beta and CDK5 and
      the immunoactivity of GSK-3beta, CDK5 and p-Tau were significantly increased
      (P<0.01), and the residence time in the platform quadrant and the number of
      platform crossing of spatial prob test and the expression of Synapsin
      significantly reduced in the model group (P<0.01). Following the intervention,
      the increase of escape latency, expression of GSK-3beta and CDK5 and the
      immunoactivity of GSK-3beta, CDK5 and p-Tau, and the decrease of residence time
      in the platform quadrant, number of platform crossing and the expression of
      Synapsin were reversed in the pre-moxibustion group (P<0.05, P<0.01). Outcomes of
      ultrastructure and histopathological observations respectively showed edema of
      hippocampal nerve cells at varying degrees, moderate edema of the cytoplasma,
      chromatin condensation at the edge of the nucleus, partial mitochondrial
      vacuole-like degeneration, fracture of tubular crest, edema and expansion of
      Golgi body, disappearance of polarity, fracture of the rough endoplasmic
      reticulum, degeneration of ribosome and partial myelin axon and reduced synaptic 
      vesicles in the presynaptic capsule; and reduced number of neurons with shrank
      body, disappearance of nucleolus and blurred nuclear boundary and vacuole-like
      degeneration in some of them in the model group, which were relatively milder in 
      the pre-moxibustion group. CONCLUSION: Pre-moxibustion at GV20, BL23 and ST36
      plays a role in slowing down the occurrence and development of cognitive
      impairment in AD rats, which may be related to its functions in inhibiting tau
      protein hyperphosphorylation and reducing the expression of some related protein 
      kinases in the hippocampus.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on the expressions of
      tight junction related proteins Claudin-5, ZO-1 in the colon and hippocampus,
      Toll-like receptor 4/nuclear factor-kappa B/NOD-like receptor protein 3
      (TLR4/NF-kappaB/NLRP3) pathway in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice, so as to
      explore its mechanisms underlying improvement of cognitive impairment. METHODS:
      Eighteen 5-month-old male APP/PS1 mice were equally randomized into model and EA 
      groups,and nine 5-month-old male C57BL/6 mice were used as the normal control.
      EA(2 Hz, 1 mA) was applied to "Baihui" (GV20), "Dachangshu" (BL25) and "Zusanli" 
      (ST36) for 15 min, once daily, 5 days a week for 5 weeks. The Morris water maze
      swimming test was used to evaluate the mice's cognitive impairment. Nissl
      staining was used to observe the pathological morphology of hippocampus. The
      expression of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) in brain tissue was detect by
      immunohistochemistry; the contents of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in colon, serum
      and hippocampus were detected by ELISA; the expression levels of Claudin-5, ZO-1 
      in colon and hippocampus, and TLR4/NF-kappaB/NLRP3 pathway related proteins in
      hippocampus were detected by Western blot. RESULTS: Compared with the normal
      group, the escape latency of the mice in the model group was prolonged from the
      3(rd) day (P<0.05, P<0.01), the number of crossing the platform and the
      percentage of target quadrant residence time were significantly decreased
      (P<0.01), and the contents of LPS in colon, serum and hippocampus were
      significantly increased (P<0.01), the expression levels of TLR4, NF-kappaB p65,
      NLRP3, Caspase-1, interleukin (IL)-1beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in
      hippocampus and Abeta in brain tissue were significantly increased (P<0.01),
      while the expression levels of Claudin-5, ZO-1 in colon and hippocampus were
      significantly decreased (P<0.01). Compared with the model group, the escape
      latency of mice in the EA group was shortened from the 4th day (P<0.05, P<0.01), 
      the number of crossing the platform and the percentage of target quadrant
      residence time were increased (P<0.01, P<0.05), and the contents of LPS in serum 
      and hippocampus were decreased (P<0.05), and the expression levels of TLR4,
      NF-kappaB p65, Caspase-1, NLRP3, IL-1beta, TNF-alpha in hippocampus and Abeta in 
      brain tissue were significantly decreased (P<0.05, P<0.01), while the expression 
      levels of Claudin-5, ZO-1 in colon and hippocampus were significantly increased
      (P<0.05, P<0.01). Outcomes of Nissl staining showed dispersed arrangement of
      neurons with nuclear pyknosis or hyperchromasia in the hippocampus, and a
      decreased number of cell layers in the model group, which was relatively milder
      in the EA group. CONCLUSION: EA may improve the cognitive impairment of APP/PS1
      mice by up-regulating the expression of Claudin-5 and ZO-1, reducing the
      transposition of gut-derived LPS to the central nervous system, inhibiting the
      over-activation of TLR4/NF-kappaB/NLRP3 pathway, and alleviating the inflammatory
      reaction of the central nervous system.

TI  - Is Alzheimer's disease an infectious neurological disease? A review of the
      literature.
PG  - e2728
LID - 10.1002/brb3.2728 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of dementia around the 
      globe. Its pathogenesis is characterized primarily by the extracellular
      deposition of amyloid beta peptides and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles.
      Despite the significant investments in neurological research, the exact molecular
      mechanism of AD pathogenesis is still not fully elucidated. Several studies
      converge on a hypothesis that pathogenic microbes might play a role in AD
      progression. Although this hypothesis has been considered relatively weak for
      decades, it has recently received considerable attention due to increasing
      evidence on the association between microorganisms and AD. There is a lack of
      experimental and scientific arguments conveying that these microorganisms
      engender cognitive and neuropathological deficits and modifications specific to
      AD, challenging the theory that it could be an infectious neurological disease.
      This review focuses on recent advances in the infection hypothesis and provides
      an overview of new findings portraying the significance of pathogenic microbes in
      AD and the challenges confronting the validity of the hypothesis. METHODOLOGY:
      Data were collected from medical journals published on PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE,
      ScienceDirect, and Embase bibliographical databases with a predefined search
      strategy. All articles considering neurological disorders, especially AD
      associated with infectious diseases, were included. RESULTS: This work focused on
      providing an overview of new findings around the relationship between
      microorganisms and AD, challenges facing the validity of the theory, and
      recommendations on how the scientific community can best develop alternative
      approaches to address the pathophysiology of AD. CONCLUSION: While many studies
      reinforce the suspicion of an infectious etiology of AD, it is important to note 
      that it is yet not validated how microorganisms' presence in the brain can
      develop AD due to the limited available evidence. Certainly, ground-breaking work
      is mandatory in this field of research, and these reports so far warrant a
      thorough investigation into how a chronic infection may remain silent while
      progressing its neuroinflammation. Amid this uncertainty arises the hope that
      many researchers will take on this challenge and join this endeavor to benefit AD
      patients worldwide.

AB  - Objective To review the data informing the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
      approval for aducanumab for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD). Data Sources At the time of writing there were no peer-reviewed
      published studies on aducanumab. All data presented are derived directly from the
      material Biogen submitted to the FDA for approval. The three studies that will be
      reviewed are: Multiple Dose Study of Aducanumab in Participants With Prodromal or
      Mild AD (PRIME), 221AD302 Phase 3 Study of Aducanumab in Early AD (EMERGE),
      221AD301 Phase 3 Study of Aducanumab in Early AD (ENGAGE). Data Synthesis PRIME, 
      which was a phase 1 study, demonstrated the most common adverse drug reactions
      were amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), which occurred at rates up to 
      47% (10 mg/kg group), headache (25%), urinary tract infection (16%), and upper
      respiratory tract infection (19%). EMERGE demonstrated that high-dose aducanumab 
      was clinically significant at slowing down clinical decline. However, ENGAGE was 
      terminated early based on a futility analysis. Prior to termination ENGAGE
      demonstrated no clinical difference between treatment and placebo regarding the
      primary endpoint of slowing clinical decline. Conclusion Based on the data to
      date, it is difficult to accurately assess the role of aducanumab in patients
      with MCI or mild AD. EMERGE showed benefit with high-dose aducanumab slowing
      clinical decline. However, ENGAGE did not duplicate this benefit. With
      conflicting evidence of positive outcomes, future phase III studies are needed to
      confirm efficacy.

TI  - A multiscale brain network model links Alzheimer's disease-mediated neuronal
      hyperactivity to large-scale oscillatory slowing.
PG  - 101
LID - 10.1186/s13195-022-01041-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neuronal hyperexcitability and inhibitory interneuron dysfunction are
      frequently observed in preclinical animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
      This study investigates whether these microscale abnormalities explain
      characteristic large-scale magnetoencephalography (MEG) activity in human
      early-stage AD patients. METHODS: To simulate spontaneous electrophysiological
      activity, we used a whole-brain computational network model comprised of 78
      neural masses coupled according to human structural brain topology. We modified
      relevant model parameters to simulate six literature-based cellular scenarios of 
      AD and compare them to one healthy and six contrast (non-AD-like) scenarios. The 
      parameters include excitability, postsynaptic potentials, and coupling strength
      of excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations. Whole-brain spike density and 
      spectral power analyses of the simulated data reveal mechanisms of neuronal
      hyperactivity that lead to oscillatory changes similar to those observed in MEG
      data of 18 human prodromal AD patients compared to 18 age-matched subjects with
      subjective cognitive decline. RESULTS: All but one of the AD-like scenarios
      showed higher spike density levels, and all but one of these scenarios had a
      lower peak frequency, higher spectral power in slower (theta, 4-8Hz) frequencies,
      and greater total power. Non-AD-like scenarios showed opposite patterns mainly,
      including reduced spike density and faster oscillatory activity. Human AD
      patients showed oscillatory slowing (i.e., higher relative power in the theta
      band mainly), a trend for lower peak frequency and higher total power compared to
      controls. Combining model and human data, the findings indicate that neuronal
      hyperactivity can lead to oscillatory slowing, likely due to hyperexcitation (by 
      hyperexcitability of pyramidal neurons or greater long-range excitatory coupling)
      and/or disinhibition (by reduced excitability of inhibitory interneurons or
      weaker local inhibitory coupling strength) in early AD. CONCLUSIONS: Using a
      computational brain network model, we link findings from different scales and
      models and support the hypothesis of early-stage neuronal hyperactivity
      underlying E/I imbalance and whole-brain network dysfunction in prodromal AD.

TI  - Issues and recommendations for the residual approach to quantifying cognitive
      resilience and reserve.
PG  - 102
LID - 10.1186/s13195-022-01049-w [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive reserve and resilience are terms used to explain
      interindividual variability in maintenance of cognitive health in response to
      adverse factors, such as brain pathology in the context of aging or
      neurodegenerative disorders. There is substantial interest in identifying
      tractable substrates of resilience to potentially leverage this phenomenon into
      intervention strategies. One way of operationalizing cognitive resilience that
      has gained popularity is the residual method: regressing cognition on an adverse 
      factor and using the residual as a measure of resilience. This method is
      attractive because it provides a statistical approach that is an intuitive match 
      to the reserve/resilience conceptual framework. However, due to statistical
      properties of the regression equation, the residual approach has qualities that
      complicate its interpretation as an index of resilience and make it statistically
      inappropriate in certain circumstances. METHODS AND RESULTS: We describe
      statistical properties of the regression equation to illustrate why the residual 
      is highly correlated with the cognitive score from which it was derived. Using
      both simulations and real data, we model common applications of the approach by
      creating a residual score (global cognition residualized for hippocampal volume) 
      in individuals along the AD spectrum. We demonstrate that in most real-life
      scenarios, the residual measure of cognitive resilience is highly correlated with
      cognition, and the degree of this correlation depends on the initial relationship
      between the adverse factor and cognition. Subsequently, any association between
      this resilience metric and an external variable may actually be driven by
      cognition, rather than by an operationalized measure of resilience. We then
      assess several strategies proposed as potential solutions to this problem, such
      as including both the residual and original cognitive measure in a model.
      However, we conclude these solutions may be insufficient, and we instead
      recommend against "pre-regression" strategies altogether in favor of using
      statistical moderation (e.g., interactions) to quantify resilience. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Caution should be taken in the use and interpretation of the residual-based
      method of cognitive resilience. Rather than identifying resilient individuals, we
      encourage building more complete models of cognition to better identify the
      specific adverse and protective factors that influence cognitive decline.

TI  - YKL-40 changes are not detected in post-mortem brain of patients with Alzheimer's
      disease and frontotemporal lobar degeneration.
PG  - 100
LID - 10.1186/s13195-022-01039-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: YKL-40 (Chitinase 3-like I) is increased in CSF of Alzheimer's
      disease (AD) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) patients and is
      therefore considered a potential neuroinflammatory biomarker. Whether changed
      YKL-40 levels in the CSF reflect dysregulation of YKL-40 in the brain is not
      completely understood yet. We aimed to extensively analyze YKL-40 levels in the
      brain of AD and different FTLD pathological subtypes. The direct relationship
      between YKL-40 levels in post-mortem brain and ante-mortem CSF was examined in a 
      small set of paired brain-CSF samples. METHOD: YKL-40 was analyzed in post-mortem
      temporal and frontal cortex of non-demented controls and patients with AD and
      FTLD (including FTLD-Tau and FTLD-TDP) pathology by immunohistochemistry
      (temporal cortex: 51 controls and 56 AD and frontal cortex: 7 controls and 24
      FTLD patients), western blot (frontal cortex: 14 controls, 5 AD and 67 FTLD
      patients), or ELISA (temporal cortex: 11 controls and 7 AD and frontal cortex: 14
      controls, 5 AD and 67 FTLD patients). YKL-40 levels were also measured in paired 
      post-mortem brain and ante-mortem CSF samples from dementia patients (n = 9,
      time-interval collection: 1.4 years) by ELISA. RESULTS: We observed that YKL-40
      post-mortem brain levels were similar between AD, FTLD, and controls as shown by 
      immunohistochemistry, western blot, and ELISA. Interestingly, strong YKL-40
      immunoreactivity was observed in AD cases with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA; 
      n = 6). In paired CSF-brain samples, YKL-40 concentration was 8-times higher in
      CSF compared to brain. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that CSF YKL-40 changes may
      not reflect YKL-40 changes within AD and FTLD pathological brain areas. The
      YKL-40 reactivity associated with classical CAA hallmarks indicates a possible
      relationship between YKL-40, neuroinflammation, and vascular pathology.

AB  - Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the second most prevalent form of early-onset
      dementia, affecting predominantly frontal and temporal cerebral lobes.
      Heterozygous mutations in the progranulin gene (GRN) cause autosomal-dominant FTD
      (FTD-GRN), associated with TDP-43 inclusions, neuronal loss, axonal degeneration 
      and gliosis, but FTD-GRN pathogenesis is largely unresolved. Here we report
      single-nucleus RNA sequencing of microglia, astrocytes and the neurovasculature
      from frontal, temporal and occipital cortical tissue from control and FTD-GRN
      brains. We show that fibroblast and mesenchymal cell numbers were enriched in
      FTD-GRN, and we identified disease-associated subtypes of astrocytes and
      endothelial cells. Expression of gene modules associated with blood-brain barrier
      (BBB) dysfunction was significantly enriched in FTD-GRN endothelial cells. The
      vasculature supportive function and capillary coverage by pericytes was reduced
      in FTD-GRN tissue, with increased and hypertrophic vascularization and an
      enrichment of perivascular T cells. Our results indicate a perturbed BBB and
      suggest that the neurovascular unit is severely affected in FTD-GRN.

AB  - To the best of our knowledge, there are no research studies about socioeconomic
      factors, family stigma, and their psychological impact on early-onset dementia
      caregivers. We assessed the impact of family stigma and socioeconomic factors on 
      psychological outcomes, quality of life (QoL), and caregiver burden among 150
      caregivers of patients with early-onset Alzheimer's disease due to E280A mutation
      in presenilin 1 (EOAD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and late-onset Alzheimer's
      disease (LOAD). Caregivers of patients with EOAD presented a higher frequency of 
      socioeconomic risk factors. Caregivers of FTD presented higher levels of family
      stigma and a higher prevalence of negative outcomes. We found family stigma to be
      a more suitable predictor of all outcomes. After adjusting for the type of
      dementia, dementia stage and behavioral changes, and caregiver age and education,
      family stigma was the most important factor associated with a higher risk of
      caregiver burden and a reduction in QoL in terms of energy fatigue and emotional 
      wellbeing among early-onset dementia caregivers.

AB  - Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) can boost risk prediction in late-onset Alzheimer's 
      disease (LOAD) beyond apolipoprotein E (APOE) but have not been leveraged to
      identify genetic resilience factors. Here, we sought to identify
      resilience-conferring common genetic variants in (1) unaffected individuals
      having high PRSs for LOAD, and (2) unaffected APOE-epsilon4 carriers also having 
      high PRSs for LOAD. We used genome-wide association study (GWAS) to contrast
      "resilient" unaffected individuals at the highest genetic risk for LOAD with LOAD
      cases at comparable risk. From GWAS results, we constructed polygenic resilience 
      scores to aggregate the addictive contributions of risk-orthogonal common
      variants that promote resilience to LOAD. Replication of resilience scores was
      undertaken in eight independent studies. We successfully replicated two polygenic
      resilience scores that reduce genetic risk penetrance for LOAD. We also showed
      that polygenic resilience scores positively correlate with polygenic risk scores 
      in unaffected individuals, perhaps aiding in staving off disease. Our findings
      align with the hypothesis that a combination of risk-independent common variants 
      mediates resilience to LOAD by moderating genetic disease risk.

TI  - Effects of chronic cadmium exposure on brain and liver transporters and
      drug-metabolizing enzymes in male and female mice genetically predisposed to
      Alzheimer's disease.
LID - DMD-AR-2021-000453 [pii]
LID - 10.1124/dmd.121.000453 [doi]
AB  - Cadmium (Cd) exposure is associated with increased Alzheimer's disease (AD)
      risks. The human Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene encodes a lipid-transporting
      protein that is critical for brain functions. Compared to ApoE2 and E3, ApoE4 is 
      associated with increased AD risk. Xenobiotic biotransformation-related genes
      have been implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. However, little is known about
      the effects of Cd, ApoE, and sex on drug-processing genes. We investigated the
      Cd-ApoE interaction on the transcriptomic changes in the brains and livers of
      ApoE3/ApoE4 transgenic mice. Cd disrupts the transcriptomes of transporter and
      drug-processing genes in brain and liver in a sex- and ApoE-genotype-specific
      manner. Pro-inflammation related genes were enriched in livers of Cd-exposed
      ApoE4 males, whereas circadian rhythm and lipid metabolism related genes were
      enriched in livers of Cd-exposed ApoE3 females. In brains, Cd up-regulated the
      arachidonic acid-metabolizing Cyp2j isoforms only in the brains of ApoE3 mice,
      whereas the dysregulation of cation transporters was male-specific. In livers,
      several direct target genes of the major xenobiotic-sensing nuclear receptor PXR 
      were uniquely upregulated in Cd-exposed ApoE4 males. There was a female-specific 
      hepatic upregulation of the steroid hormone-metabolizing Cyp2 isoforms and the
      bile acid synthetic enzyme Cyp7a1 by Cd exposure. The dysregulated liver
      transporters were mostly involved in intermediary metabolism, with the most
      significant response observed in ApoE3 females. In conclusion, Cd dysregulated
      the brain and liver drug-processing genes in a sex- and ApoE-genotype specific
      manner, and this may serve as a contributing factor for the variance in the
      susceptibility to Cd neurotoxicity. Significance Statement Xenobiotic
      biotransformation plays an important role in modulating the toxicity of
      environmental pollutants. The human ApoE4 allele is the strongest genetic risk
      factor for AD, and cadmium (Cd) is increasingly recognized as an environmental
      factor of AD. Very little is known regarding the interactions between Cd
      exposure, sex, and the genes involved in xenobiotic biotransformation in brain
      and liver. The present study has addressed this critical knowledge gap.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common type of dementia in the elderly, is a
      chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disorder with no effective
      disease-modifying treatments to date. Studies have shown that an imbalance in
      brain metal ions, such as zinc, copper, and iron, is closely related to the onset
      and progression of AD. Many efforts have been made to understand metal-related
      mechanisms and therapeutic strategies for AD. Emerging evidence suggests that
      interactions of brain metal ions and apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which is the
      strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset AD, may be one of the mechanisms for
      neurodegeneration. Here, we summarize the key points regarding how metal ions and
      ApoE contribute to the pathogenesis of AD. We further describe the interactions
      between metal ions and ApoE in the brain and propose that their interactions play
      an important role in neuropathological alterations and cognitive decline in AD.

TI  - DES-Amyloidoses "Amyloidoses through the looking-glass": A knowledgebase
      developed for exploring and linking information related to human amyloid-related 
      diseases.

AB  - More than 30 types of amyloids are linked to close to 50 diseases in humans, the 
      most prominent being Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is brain-related local
      amyloidosis, while another amyloidosis, such as AA amyloidosis, tends to be more 
      systemic. Therefore, we need to know more about the biological entities'
      influencing these amyloidosis processes. However, there is currently no support
      system developed specifically to handle this extraordinarily complex and
      demanding task. To acquire a systematic view of amyloidosis and how this may be
      relevant to the brain and other organs, we needed a means to explore "amyloid
      network systems" that may underly processes that leads to an amyloid-related
      disease. In this regard, we developed the DES-Amyloidoses knowledgebase (KB) to
      obtain fast and relevant information regarding the biological network related to 
      amyloid proteins/peptides and amyloid-related diseases. This KB contains
      information obtained through text and data mining of available scientific
      literature and other public repositories. The information compiled into the
      DES-Amyloidoses system based on 19 topic-specific dictionaries resulted in
      796,409 associations between terms from these dictionaries. Users can explore
      this information through various options, including enriched concepts, enriched
      pairs, and semantic similarity. We show the usefulness of the KB using an example
      focused on inflammasome-amyloid associations. To our knowledge, this is the only 
      KB dedicated to human amyloid-related diseases derived primarily through
      literature text mining and complemented by data mining that provides a novel way 
      of exploring information relevant to amyloidoses.

TI  - Effectiveness of Serious Games for Improving Executive Functions Among Older
      Adults With Cognitive Impairment: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.
PG  - e36123
LID - 10.2196/36123 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Executive functions are one of the known cognitive abilities that
      decline with age. They are the high-order cognitive processes that enable an
      individual to concentrate, plan, and take action. Serious games, which are games 
      developed for specific purposes other than entertainment, could play a positive
      role in improving executive functions. Several systematic reviews have pooled the
      evidence about the effectiveness of serious games in improving executive
      functions; however, they are limited by some weaknesses. OBJECTIVE: This study
      aims to investigate the effectiveness of serious games for improving executive
      functions among older adults with cognitive impairment. METHODS: A systematic
      review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted. To retrieve relevant
      studies, 8 electronic databases were searched. Further, reference lists of the
      included studies and relevant reviews were screened, and we checked studies that 
      cited our included studies. Two reviewers independently checked the eligibility
      of the studies, extracted data from the included studies, assessed the risk of
      bias, and appraised the quality of the evidence. We used a narrative and
      statistical approach, as appropriate, to synthesize results of the included
      studies. RESULTS: Of 548 publications identified, 16 RCTs were eventually
      included in this review. Of the 16 studies, 14 studies were included in 6
      meta-analyses. Our meta-analyses showed that serious games are as effective as no
      or passive interventions at improving executive functions (P=.29). Surprisingly, 
      conventional exercises were more effective than serious games at improving
      executive functions (P=.03). Our subgroup analysis showed that both types of
      serious games (cognitive training games, P=.08; exergames, P=.16) are as
      effective as conventional exercises at improving executive functions. No
      difference was found between adaptive serious games and nonadaptive serious games
      for improving executive functions (P=.59). CONCLUSIONS: Serious games are not
      superior to no or passive interventions and conventional exercises at improving
      executive functions among older adults with cognitive impairment. However, our
      findings remain inconclusive due to the low quality of the evidence, the small
      sample size in most included studies, and the paucity of studies included in the 
      meta-analyses. Accordingly, until more robust evidence is available, serious
      games should not be offered by health care providers nor used by patients for
      improving executive functions among older adults with cognitive impairment.
      Further reviews are needed to assess the long-term effect of serious games on
      specific executive functions or other cognitive abilities among people from
      different age groups with or without cognitive impairment. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Amyloid Fibril Formation of Arctic Amyloid-beta 1-42 Peptide is Efficiently
      Inhibited by the BRICHOS Domain.
LID - 10.1021/acschembio.2c00344 [doi]
AB  - Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) aggregation is one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's
      disease (AD). Mutations in Abeta are associated with early onset familial AD, and
      the Arctic mutant E22G (Abeta(arc)) is an extremely aggregation-prone variant.
      Here, we show that BRICHOS, a natural anti-amyloid chaperone domain, from Bri2
      efficiently inhibits aggregation of Abeta(arc) by mainly interfering with
      secondary nucleation. This is qualitatively different from the microscopic
      inhibition mechanism for the wild-type Abeta, against which Bri2 BRICHOS has a
      major effect on both secondary nucleation and fibril end elongation. The
      monomeric Abeta42(arc) peptide aggregates into amyloid fibrils significantly
      faster than wild-type Abeta (Abeta42(wt)), as monitored by thioflavin T (ThT)
      binding, but the final ThT intensity was strikingly lower for Abeta42(arc)
      compared to Abeta42(wt) fibrils. The Abeta42(arc) peptide formed large
      aggregates, single-filament fibrils, and multiple-filament fibrils without
      obvious twists, while Abeta42(wt) fibrils displayed a polymorphic pattern with
      typical twisted fibril architecture. Recombinant human Bri2 BRICHOS binds to the 
      Abeta42(arc) fibril surface and interferes with the macroscopic fibril
      arrangement by promoting single-filament fibril formation. This study provides
      mechanistic insights on how BRICHOS efficiently affects the aggressive
      Abeta42(arc) aggregation, resulting in both delayed fibril formation kinetics and
      altered fibril structure.

TI  - Consistent Effects of Hypoglycemia on Cognitive Function in People With or
      Without Diabetes.
LID - dc212502 [pii]
LID - 10.2337/dc21-2502 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Hypoglycemia poses an immediate threat for cognitive function. Due to 
      its association with acute cognitive impairment, the International Hypoglycemia
      Study Group (IHSG) defines a blood glucose level <3.0 mmol/L as "level 2
      hypoglycemia." In the current study we investigated whether having diabetes, type
      of diabetes, or hypoglycemia awareness moderates this association. RESEARCH
      DESIGN AND METHODS: Adults with type 1 diabetes with normal (n = 26) or impaired 
      (n = 21) hypoglycemic awareness or with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes (n = 15) 
      and age-matched control subjects without diabetes (n = 32) underwent a
      hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic-hypoglycemic glucose clamp (2.80 +/- 0.13 mmol/L
      [50.2 +/- 2.3 mg/dL]). At baseline and during hypoglycemia, calculation ability, 
      attention, working memory and cognitive flexibility were measured with the Paced 
      Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) and the Test of Attentional Performance
      (TAP). RESULTS: For the whole group, hypoglycemia decreased the mean +/- SD
      proportion of correct answers on the PASAT by 8.4 +/- 12.8%, increased reaction
      time on the TAP Alertness task by 32.1 +/- 66.6 ms, and increased the sum of
      errors and omissions on the TAP Working Memory task by 2.0 +/- 5.5 (all P <
      0.001). Hypoglycemia-induced cognitive declines were largely irrespective of the 
      presence or type of diabetes, level of symptomatic awareness, diabetes duration, 
      or HbA1c. CONCLUSIONS: IHSG level 2 hypoglycemia impairs cognitive function in
      people with and without diabetes, irrespective of type of diabetes or
      hypoglycemia awareness status. These findings support the cutoff value of
      hypoglycemia <3.0 mmol/L (<54 mg/dL) as being clinically relevant for most people
      with diabetes.

TI  - Aging Effect, Reproducibility, and Test-Retest Reliability of a New Cerebral
      Amyloid Angiopathy MRI Severity Marker-Cerebrovascular Reactivity to Visual
      Stimulation.
LID - 10.1002/jmri.28362 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Decreased cerebrovascular reactivity, measured as changes in
      blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal, is a potential new cerebral amyloid
      angiopathy (CAA) severity marker. Before clinical application, the effect of
      aging on BOLD parameters, and reproducibility and test-retest reliability of
      these parameters should be assessed. PURPOSE: Assess the effect of healthy aging 
      on cerebrovascular reactivity (BOLD amplitude, time to peak, and time to
      baseline). And determine reproducibility and test-retest reliability of these
      parameters. STUDY TYPE: Prospective-observational. POPULATION: Eighty-six healthy
      adults (mean age 56 years, 55% female), 10 presymptomatic D-CAA mutation carriers
      (mean age 34 years, 70% female), and 10 symptomatic D-CAA mutation carriers (mean
      age 54 years, 70% female). FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 3-T, three-dimensional (3D)
      T1-weighted MRI and gradient echo BOLD fMRI. ASSESSMENT: To assess test-retest
      reliability of BOLD parameters, i.e. BOLD amplitude, time to peak, and time to
      baseline, BOLD fMRI scans were repeated three times immediately after each other,
      in both controls and mutation carriers. To assess reproducibility, BOLD fMRI
      scans were repeated with a 3-week interval for each subject. STATISTICAL TESTS:
      Linear regression analyses and two-way mixed absolute agreement intra-class
      correlation approach. RESULTS: Healthy aging was associated with decreased BOLD
      amplitude (beta = -0.711) and prolonged time to baseline (beta = 0.236) in the
      visual cortex after visual stimulation Reproducibility of BOLD amplitude was
      excellent (ICC 0.940) in the subgroup of healthy adults. Test-retest reliability 
      for BOLD amplitude was excellent in healthy adults (ICC 0.856-0.910) and
      presymptomatic D-CAA mutation carriers (ICC 0.959-0.981). In symptomatic D-CAA
      mutation carriers, test-retest reliability was poor for all parameters (ICCs <
      0.5). DATA CONCLUSION: Healthy aging is associated with decreased cerebrovascular
      reactivity, measured by changes in BOLD response to visual stimulation. The BOLD 
      amplitude appears to be a robust measurement in healthy adults and presymptomatic
      D-CAA mutation carriers, but not in symptomatic D-CAA mutation carriers.

      Alzheimer's Disease.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disease, remains
      unclear in terms of its underlying causative genes and effective therapeutic
      approaches. Meanwhile, abnormalities in iron metabolism have been demonstrated in
      patients and mouse models with AD. Therefore, this study sought to find hub genes
      based on iron metabolism that can influence the diagnosis and treatment of AD.
      First, gene expression profiles were downloaded from the GEO database, including 
      non-demented (ND) controls and AD samples. Fourteen iron metabolism-related gene 
      sets were downloaded from the MSigDB database, yielding 520 iron
      metabolism-related genes. The final nine hub genes associated with iron
      metabolism and AD were obtained by differential analysis and WGCNA in brain
      tissue samples from GSE132903. GO analysis revealed that these genes were mainly 
      involved in two major biological processes, autophagy and iron metabolism.
      Through stepwise regression and logistic regression analyses, we selected four of
      these genes to construct a diagnostic model of AD. The model was validated in
      blood samples from GSE63061 and GSE85426, and the AUC values showed that the
      model had a relatively good diagnostic performance. In addition, the immune cell 
      infiltration of the samples and the correlation of different immune factors with 
      these hub genes were further explored. The results suggested that these genes may
      also play an important role in immunity to AD. Finally, eight drugs targeting
      these nine hub genes were retrieved from the DrugBank database, some of which
      were shown to be useful for the treatment of AD or other concomitant conditions, 
      such as insomnia and agitation. In conclusion, this model is expected to guide
      the diagnosis of patients with AD by detecting the expression of several genes in
      the blood. These hub genes may also assist in understanding the development and
      drug treatment of AD.

      Targets.

AB  - Background: Human neurodegenerative diseases occur as a result of various
      factors. Regardless of the variety in the etiology of development, many of these 
      diseases are characterized by the accumulation of pathological, misfolded
      proteins; hence, such diseases are considered as proteinopathies. While plenty of
      research study has been conducted in order to identify the pathophysiology of
      these proteinopathies, there is still a lack of understanding in terms of
      potential therapeutic targets. Summary: Molecular chaperones present the main
      workforce for cellular protection and stress response. Therefore, considering
      these functions, molecular chaperones present a promising target for research
      within the field of conformational diseases that arise from proteinopathies.
      Since the association between neurodegenerative disorders and their long-term
      consequences is well documented, the need for the development of new therapeutic 
      strategies becomes even more critical. Key message: In this review, we summarized
      the molecular function of heat shock proteins and recent progress on their role, 
      involvement, and other mechanisms related to neurodegeneration caused by
      different etiological factors. Based on the relevant scientific data, we will
      highlight the functional classification of heat shock proteins, regulation, and
      their therapeutic potential for neurodegenerative disorders.

TI  - In vitro anticholinesterase potential of some spices consumed in Cameroon and
      their protective effects on hydrogen peroxide-mediated oxidative stress damage in
      SK-N-SH cells.
PG  - 107-113
LID - 10.1016/j.ibneur.2022.07.001 [doi]
AB  - Background: Many neurodegenerative such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) are
      characterized by cholinergic dysfunction and oxidative stress which is a key
      event in neuronal death process. Thus, anticholinesterase and anti-oxidation
      compounds are two promising strategies in the development of AD drugs. Beyond
      their culinary use, spices are today studies for health purpose. In this study,
      some spices consumed in Cameroon were evaluated for their anticholinesterase and 
      neuroprotective effects. Methods: Colorimetric methods were used to determine
      total flavonoid and alkaloid content of a combinated extract (hydroethanolic +
      ethanolic extracts) of different selected spices. Aftermaths, anti-cholinesterase
      activity of spice extract was carried out using Ellman's method. Finally,
      neuroprotective effects performed on human SK-N-SH cells stressed with H2O2 by
      assessing neuronal survival ( resazurin assay) and neuronal death (LDH assay).
      Results: Flavonoid content of spices extract were ranged from 22.94 to 32.01 mg
      EQ/g DM and alkaloid content were ranged from 320 to 896 mg EQu/g DM. Among the
      spices studied, Xylopia parviflora presented the greatest acetylcholinesterase
      inhibition with an IC50 = 14 microg/mL. In Cell culture experiments,
      pre-incubation of SK-N-SH cell with the selected spices at different
      concentrations were improved neuronal survival and reduced the percentage of
      neuronal cells dead. Conclusion: The present results reveal that selected spices 
      consumed in Cameroon have good anticholinesterase activity as well as
      neuroprotective effect on SK-N-SH which may provide new natural compounds that
      could help in the management of Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) networks derived from resting-state
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) help us understand fundamental
      dynamic characteristics of human brains, thereby providing an efficient solution 
      for automated identification of brain diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
      and its prodromal stage. Existing studies have applied deep learning methods to
      dFC network analysis and achieved good performance compared with traditional
      machine learning methods. However, they seldom take advantage of sequential
      information conveyed in dFC networks that could be informative to improve the
      diagnosis performance. In this paper, we propose a convolutional recurrent neural
      network (CRNN) for automated brain disease classification with rs-fMRI data.
      Specifically, we first construct dFC networks from rs-fMRI data using a sliding
      window strategy. Then, we employ three convolutional layers and long short-term
      memory (LSTM) layer to extract high-level features of dFC networks and also
      preserve the sequential information of extracted features, followed by three
      fully connected layers for brain disease classification. Experimental results on 
      174 subjects with 563 rs-fMRI scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
      Initiative (ADNI) demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in binary 
      and multi-category classification tasks.

TI  - Diffusion Tensor Imaging Profiles Can Distinguish Diffusivity and Neural
      Properties of White Matter Injury in Hydrocephalus vs. Non-hydrocephalus Using a 
      Strategy of a Periodic Table of DTI Elements.
PG  - 868026
LID - 10.3389/fneur.2022.868026 [doi]
AB  - Background: The aim of this study was to create a simplistic taxonomy to improve 
      transparency and consistency in, and reduce complexity of, interpreting diffusion
      tensor imaging (DTI) profiles in white matter disruption. Using a novel strategy 
      of a periodic table of DTI elements, we examined if DTI profiles could
      demonstrate neural properties of disruption sufficient to characterize white
      matter changes specific for hydrocephalus vs. non-hydrocephalus, and to
      distinguish between cohorts of neural injury by their differing potential for
      reversibility. Methods: DTI datasets from three clinical cohorts representing
      pathological milestones from reversible to irreversible brain injury were
      compared to those of healthy controls at baseline, over time and with
      interventions. The final dataset comprised patients vs. controls in the following
      groupings: mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), n = 24 vs. 27, normal pressure
      hydrocephalus (NPH), n = 16 vs. 9 and Alzheimer's disease (AD), n = 27 vs. 47. We
      generated DTI profiles from fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean, axial and radial
      diffusivity measures (MD, L1 and L2 and 3 respectively), and constructed an
      algorithm to map changes consistently to a periodic table of elements, which
      fully described their diffusivity and neural properties. Results: Mapping tissue 
      signatures to a periodic table of DTI elements rapidly characterized cohorts by
      their differing patterns of injury. At baseline, patients with mTBI displayed the
      most preserved tracts. In NPH, the magnitude of changes was dependent on
      "familial" DTI neuroanatomy, i.e., potential for neural distortion from risk of
      ventriculomegaly. With time, patients with Alzheimer's disease were significantly
      different to controls across multiple measures. By contrast, patients with mTBI
      showed both loss of integrity and pathophysiological processes of neural repair. 
      In NPH, some patterns of injury, such as "stretch/compression" and "compression" 
      were more reversible following intervention than others; these neural profile
      properties suggested "microstructural resilience" to injury. Conclusion: Using
      the novel strategy of a periodic table of DTI elements, our study has
      demonstrated it is possible to distinguish between different cohorts along the
      spectrum of brain injury by describing neural profile properties of white matter 
      disruption. Further work to contribute datasets of disease toward this proposed
      taxonomic framework would enhance the translatability of DTI profiles to the
      clinical-research interface.

      Burden of Caregivers in Alzheimer's Disease, Dementia With Lewy Bodies and Mild
      Cognitive Impairment in China: A 1-Year Follow-Up Study.
PG  - 921535
LID - 10.3389/fpsyt.2022.921535 [doi]
AB  - Background: Many countries have adopted lockdown strategies to prevent the spread
      of COVID-19. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of the
      pandemic on anxiety, depression and care burden in caregivers of nursing patients
      with Alzheimer's disease (AD), Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) and Mild Cognitive
      Impairment (MCI), over a one-year period. Methods: We collected data on
      consecutive patients and their caregivers recruited at T0 (from 30 September to
      31 December 2019) before the pandemic of COVID-19 at the memory clinic of Tianjin
      Huanhu Hospital. The patients and caregivers were followed up on face-to-face at 
      T1 (from 30 September to 31 December 2020) during the pandemic to assess changes 
      in physical activity, social contact, sleep quality, caregiver burden, anxiety
      and depression. Results: A total of 105 AD, 22 DLB and 50 MCI patients and
      caregivers were enrolled. A total of 36.6 % of the AD, 81.6% of the DLB, 38% of
      the MCI caregivers had worsening ZBI, whereas 31.7 % of the AD, 54.4% of the DLB,
      26 % of the MCI caregivers had worsening GAD-7, and 29.6 % of the AD, 54.4% of
      the DLB, and 32 % of the MCI caregivers had worsening PHQ-9. DLB caregivers
      exhibited a rapid deterioration of ZBI (by 4.27 +/- 5.43, P < 0.001), GAD-7 (by
      2.23 +/- 3.26, P = 0.003) and PHQ-9 (by 1.32 +/- 2.25, P = 0.003) compared to AD 
      and MCI caregivers. Conclusion: Social isolation, physical inactivity and sleep
      disturbance after lockdown for at least 12 months were significantly related to
      increased caregiver burden and worsened psychological states of caregivers of AD,
      DLB and MCI sufferers, especially among DLB caregivers.

PG  - 870144
LID - 10.3389/fcvm.2022.870144 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are pathologies that
      are characterized by common signatures of vascular dysfunction and chronic
      inflammation that are accelerated with aging. Importantly, epidemiological
      studies report an independent interaction between AD and CVD and data suggest
      that chronic inflammation in CVD may accelerate AD development. Atherosclerosis
      affects most large to medium sized arteries including those supplying the
      cerebral circulation. Vascular dysfunction caused by atherosclerosis results in
      blood brain barrier breakdown, inflammation, an impaired clearance of
      amyloid-beta (Abeta), and finally ends with neurovascular dysfunction. Numerous
      data indicate that innate and adaptive immune responses shape atherogenesis and
      increasing evidence suggests an implication of the immune response in AD
      progression. Currently, mechanisms by which these two diseases are interconnected
      with each other are not well-defined. In this review, we discuss the recent
      advances in our understanding of the intertwined role of the immune response in
      atherosclerosis and AD and the implications of these findings for human health.

TI  - Empirical and Authoritative Classification of Neuropsychiatric Syndromes in
      Neurocognitive Disorders.
PG  - appineuropsych21100249
LID - 10.1176/appi.neuropsych.21100249 [doi]
AB  - Neuropsychiatric symptoms of neurocognitive disorders have been classified into
      higher-order constructs, often called neuropsychiatric syndromes. As with the
      general psychopathology literature, these classifications have been achieved
      through two approaches: empirical and authoritative. The authoritative approach
      relies on expert panels that condense the available evidence into operational
      criteria, whereas the empirical approach uses statistical methods to discover
      symptom patterns and possible hierarchies formed by them. In this article, the
      author reviews the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches using general
      psychopathology literature as a reference point. The authoritative approach,
      influenced by the DSM, has led to several sets of criteria, which could aid
      clinical trials, diagnostics, and communication. However, unknown reliability and
      the complex relationships between empirical evidence and published criteria may
      limit the utility of current criteria. The empirical approach has been used to
      explore syndrome structures on the basis of rating scales for neuropsychiatric
      symptoms. The structures suggested in these studies have not been replicated
      easily and have been limited by either small sample sizes, restricted breadth of 
      neuropsychiatric assessment, or both. Suggestions for further development of both
      approaches are offered. First, neuropsychiatric symptoms and syndromes need to be
      studied with measures of broad scope and in large samples. These requirements are
      prerequisites not only for eliciting highly informative empirical classifications
      but also for understanding these symptoms at a more nuanced level. Second, both
      approaches could benefit from more transparency. Finally, the reliability of the 
      available authoritative criteria should be examined.

AB  - A subset of octogenarians and older maintain normal cognitive function (CNOO)
      despite high prevalence and incidence of cognitive decline attributed to
      neurodegeneration or aging in the population. The rostral prefrontal cortex
      (rPFC) and hippocampal formation are brain regions integral to cognition, namely 
      attention and memory, facilitated in part by cholinergic innervation. We
      hypothesized that preserved cholinergic neurotransmission in these regions
      contributes to intact cognition in the CNOO. To test this, we evaluated the
      burden of neuropathological and cholinesterase-associated protein aggregates in
      the rPFC and hippocampal formation. Tissues from age- and sex-matched CNOO and
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) rPFC and hippocampal formation were stained for
      beta-amyloid (Abeta), tau, alpha-synuclein, phosphorylated TAR DNA-binding
      protein 43 (pTDP-43), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and butyrylcholinesterase
      (BChE). The relative abundance of neuropathological aggregates was
      semi-quantitatively scored. Deposition of Abeta plaques, tau neurofibrillary
      tangles (NFT) and pTDP-43 inclusions were comparable between CNOO and AD cases.
      Intraneuronal Abeta and tau-positive thorny astrocytes consistent with
      aging-related tau astrogliopathy, were also noted in the rPFC. Abundance of
      BChE-positive plaque pathology was significantly higher in AD than in CNOO cases 
      in most regions of interest, followed closely by abundance of AChE-positive
      plaque pathology. BChE and AChE activities were also associated with varied NFT
      morphologies. CNOO cases maintained cognition despite a high neuropathological
      burden in the rPFC and hippocampal formation. BChE-positive and, to a lesser
      extent, AChE-positive pathologies were significantly lower in most regions in the
      CNOO compared to AD. This suggests a specificity of cholinesterase-associated
      neuropathology with AD. We conclude that while CNOO have
      cholinesterase-associated neuropathology in the rPFC and hippocampal formation,
      abundance in this population is significantly lower compared to AD which may
      contribute to their intact cognition.

TI  - Costs of Persons with Dementia Living in Nursing Homes in The Netherlands.
LID - 10.3233/JAD-220416 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Disease modifying treatments (DMTs) currently under development for
      Alzheimer's disease, have the potential to prevent or postpone
      institutionalization and more expensive care and might delay institutionalization
      of persons with dementia. OBJECTIVE: The current study estimates costs of living 
      in a nursing home for persons with dementia in the Netherlands to help inform
      economic evaluations of future DMTs. METHODS: Data were collected during
      semi-structured interviews with healthcare professionals and from the financial
      administration of a healthcare organization with several nursing homes. Personnel
      costs were calculated using a bottom-up approach by valuing the time estimates.
      Non-personnel costs were calculated using information from the financial
      administration of the healthcare organization. RESULTS: Total personnel costs of 
      a person with dementia per 24 hours, including both care staff and other
      healthcare providers, were euro 151 for small-scale living wards and euro 147 for
      independent living wards. Non-personnel costs were euro 37 per day. CONCLUSION:
      This study provides Dutch estimates for total healthcare costs per day for
      institutionalized persons with dementia. These cost estimates can be used in
      cost-effectiveness analyses for future DMTs in dementia.

TI  - Comparative Analysis of Alzheimer's Disease Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers
      Measurement by Multiplex SOMAscan Platform and Immunoassay-Based Approach.
LID - 10.3233/JAD-220399 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The SOMAscan assay has an advantage over immunoassay-based methods
      because it measures a large number of proteins in a cost-effective manner.
      However, the performance of this technology compared to the routinely used
      immunoassay techniques needs to be evaluated. OBJECTIVE: We performed comparative
      analyses of SOMAscan and immunoassay-based protein measurements for five
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and
      neurodegeneration: NfL, Neurogranin, sTREM2, VILIP-1, and SNAP-25. METHODS: We
      compared biomarkers measured in ADNI (N = 689), Knight-ADRC (N = 870), DIAN (N = 
      115), and Barcelona-1 (N = 92) cohorts. Raw protein values were transformed using
      z-score in order to combine measures from the different studies. sTREM2 and
      VILIP-1 had more than one analyte in SOMAscan; all available analytes were
      evaluated. Pearson's correlation coefficients between SOMAscan and immunoassays
      were calculated. Receiver operating characteristic curve and area under the curve
      were used to compare prediction accuracy of these biomarkers between the two
      platforms. RESULTS: Neurogranin, VILIP-1, and NfL showed high correlation between
      SOMAscan and immunoassay measures (r > 0.9). sTREM2 had a fair correlation (r >
      0.6), whereas SNAP-25 showed weak correlation (r = 0.06). Measures in both
      platforms provided similar predicted performance for all biomarkers except
      SNAP-25 and one of the sTREM2 analytes. sTREM2 showed higher AUC for SOMAscan
      based measures. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that SOMAscan performs as well as
      immunoassay approaches for NfL, Neurogranin, VILIP-1, and sTREM2. Our study shows
      promise for using SOMAscan as an alternative to traditional immunoassay-based
      measures. Follow-up investigation will be required for SNAP-25 and additional
      established biomarkers.

TI  - Rich-Club Connectivity of the Structural Covariance Network Relates to Memory
      Processes in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease.
LID - 10.3233/JAD-220175 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Though mediotemporal lobe volume changes are well-known features of
      Alzheimer's disease (AD), grey matter volume changes may be distributed
      throughout the brain. These distributed changes are not independent due to the
      underlying network structure and can be described in terms of a structural
      covariance network (SCN). OBJECTIVE: To investigate how the cortical brain
      organization is altered in AD we studied the mutual connectivity of hubs in the
      SCN, i.e., the rich-club. METHODS: To construct the SCNs, cortical thickness was 
      obtained from structural MRI for 97 participants (normal cognition, n = 37; mild 
      cognitive impairment, n = 41; Alzheimer-type dementia, n = 19). Subsequently,
      rich-club coefficients were calculated from the SCN, and related to memory
      performance and hippocampal volume using linear regression. RESULTS: Lower
      rich-club connectivity was related to lower memory performance as well as lower
      hippocampal volume. CONCLUSION: Therefore, this study provides novel evidence of 
      reduced connectivity in hub areas in relation to AD-related cognitive impairments
      and atrophy.

TI  - Incidental Finding: Urine Alzheimer-Associated Neuronal Thread Protein (AD7c-NTP)
      and Serum Vitamin D25.
LID - 10.3233/JAD-220165 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: National and international experts have been attempting to find
      diagnostic tools for the early identification of symptoms to facilitate early
      identification and intervention of the disease. OBJECTIVE: Detection of urine
      Alzheimer-associated neuronal thread protein (AD7c-NTP) and serum
      25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
      METHODS: Subjects aged >50 years who underwent a physical examination at the
      Taihu Sanatorium of Jiangsu Province, had no clinical evidence of AD-related
      issues, and had normal Mini-Mental State Exam and Montreal Cognitive Assessment
      scores were enrolled in the present study. There were 35 males and 15 females,
      who were aged 51-91 years. Urine AD7c-NTP levels and serum 25(OH)D concentrations
      were measured. RESULTS: The Pearson correlation analysis revealed that the urine 
      AD7c-NTP levels in these subjects were negatively correlated with the serum
      25(OH)D concentrations (r = -0.460, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Combined with
      previous studies, it was considered that cognitive function might be the only
      link for the correlation between AD7c-NTP and 25(OH)D. This finding might provide
      a starting point to investigate the potential value of the interaction between
      urine AD7c-NTP and serum 25(OH)D in chronic diseases. Further large-scale studies
      are needed to validate the results of the present study.

TI  - Population Attributable Fractions for Modifiable Risk Factors of Incident
      Dementia in Cognitively Normal and Mild Cognitively Impaired Older Adults: Data
      from Two Cohort Studies.
LID - 10.3233/JAD-215386 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent global meta-analyses show that 40% of dementia cases can be
      attributed to twelve modifiable risk factors. OBJECTIVE: To investigate how
      health promotion strategies may differ in specific populations, this study
      estimated population attributable fractions (PAFs) of these risk factors for
      dementia in cognitively normal (CN) individuals and individuals with mild
      cognitive impairment (MCI) in United States and Greek cohorts. METHODS: We
      re-analyzed data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Centre (NACC, n =
      16,147, mean age 75.2+/-6.9 years, 59.0% female) and the Hellenic Longitudinal
      Investigation of Aging and Diet (HELIAD, n = 1,141, mean age 72.9+/-5.0 years,
      58.0% female). PAFs for the total samples and CN and MCI subgroups were
      calculated based on hazard ratios for the risk of dementia and risk factor
      prevalence in NACC (9 risk factors) and HELIAD (10 risk factors). RESULTS: In
      NACC, 2,630 participants developed MCI (25.1%) and 3,333 developed dementia
      (20.7%) during a mean follow-up of 4.9+/-3.5 years. Weighted overall PAFs were
      19.4% in the total sample, 15.9% in the CN subgroup, and 3.3% in the MCI
      subgroup. In HELIAD, 131 participants developed MCI (11.2%) and 68 developed
      dementia (5.9%) during an average follow-up of 3.1+/-0.86 years. Weighted overall
      PAFs were 65.5% in the total sample, 65.8% in the CN subgroup and 64.6% in the
      MCI subgroup. CONCLUSION: Translation of global meta-analysis data on modifiable 
      risk factors should be carefully carried out per population. The PAFs of risk
      factors differ substantially across populations, directing health policy making
      to tailored risk factor modification plans.

AB  - PURPOSE OF THE RESEARCH: To evaluate the association of the exposure of
      trichlorophenols (TCPs) on the morbidity and mortality of patients with
      Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) using the data from the
      National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003-2010.
      Multivariable logistic regression models and COX regression were used to evaluate
      the association between TCP exposure and the AD and PD risk. Least Absolute
      Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) methods were used to screen latent
      covariates. PRINCIPAL RESULTS: A total of 6333 participants over the age of 18
      years were included in the analysis. After the adjustments for major confounders,
      participants with higher concentrations of urinary 2,4,6-TCP had higher risk of
      AD (odds ratios (ORs), 3.19; 95% CI: 1.07, 9.45) than the group below the limit
      of detection (LOD). Compared to group of below the LOD, higher urinary
      concentrations of 2,4,5-TCP was associated with higher risk of all-cause
      mortality in PD patients (log-rank P=0.022) and all participants (log-rank
      P<0.001) without adjustments for confounders. In addition, a higher risk of
      all-cause mortality in all participants with high urinary concentrations of
      2,4,6-TCP (log-rank P=0.001) was found without adjustments for confounders. With 
      the adjustments for major confounders, participants with higher concentrations of
      urinary 2,4,5-TCP had a higher risk of death in patients with PD (hazard ratios
      (HRs), 53.19; 95% CI: 2.82, 1004.13) than in the group below the LOD. MAJOR
      CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to high concentration of 2,4,6-TCP may increase the risk of
      AD, and the level of 2,4,5-TCP may be associated with the risk of death in
      patients with PD. Our findings reveal the potential toxicity of TCPs, highlight
      the potential impact of TCPs on neurodegenerative diseases, and express concerns 
      regarding the use of organochlorine pesticides.

AB  - Cysteine (Cys) is subject to a variety of reversible post-translational
      modifications such as formation of sulfenic acid (Cys-SOH). If this modification 
      is often involved in normal biological activities, it can also be the result of
      oxidative damage. Indeed, oxidative stress yields abnormal cysteine oxidations
      that affect protein function and structure and can lead to neurodegenerative
      diseases. In a context of population ageing, validation of novel biomarkers for
      detection of neurodegenerative diseases is important. However, Cys-SOH proteins
      investigation in large human cohorts is challenging due to their low abundance
      and lability under endogenous conditions. To improve the detection specificity
      towards the oxidized protein subpopulation, we developed a method that makes use 
      of a mass spectrometer coupled with visible laser induced dissociation (LID) to
      add a stringent optical specificity to the mass selectivity. Since peptides do
      not naturally absorb in the visible range, this approach relies on the proper
      chemical derivatization of Cys-SOH with a chromophore functionalized with a
      cyclohexanedione. To compensate for the significant variability in total protein 
      expression within the samples and any experimental bias, a normalizing strategy
      using free thiol (Cys-SH) cysteine peptides derivatized with a maleimide
      chromophore as internal references was used. Thanks to the differential tagging, 
      oxidative ratios were then obtained for 69 Cys-containing peptides from 19
      proteins tracked by parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) LID, in a cohort of 49
      human plasma samples from Alzheimer disease (AD) patients. A statistical analysis
      indicated that, for the proteins monitored, the Cys oxidative ratio does not
      correlate with the diagnosis of AD. Nevertheless, the PRM-LID method allows the
      unbiased, sensitive and robust relative quantification of Cys oxidation within
      cohorts of samples.

TI  - Frontal grey matter microstructure is associated with sleep slow waves
      characteristics in late midlife.
LID - zsac178 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/sleep/zsac178 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: The ability to generate slow waves (SW) during non-rapid eye
      movement (NREM) sleep decreases as early as the 5 th decade of life,
      predominantly over frontal regions. This decrease may concern prominently SW
      characterised by a fast switch from hyperpolarised to depolarised, or down-to-up,
      state. Yet, the relationship between these fast and slow switcher SW and cerebral
      microstructure in ageing is not established. METHODS: We recorded habitual sleep 
      under EEG in 99 healthy late-midlife individuals (mean age =59.3+/-5.3y; 68
      women) and extracted SW parameters (density, amplitude, frequency) for all SW as 
      well as according to their switcher type (slow vs. fast). We further used neurite
      orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) to assess microstructural
      integrity over a frontal grey matter region of interest (ROI). RESULTS: In
      statistical models adjusted for age, sex, and sleep duration, we found that a
      lower SW density, particularly for fast switcher SW, was associated with a
      reduced orientation dispersion of neurites in the frontal ROI (p = 0.018,
      R(2)beta* =0.06). In addition, overall SW frequency was positively associated
      with neurite density (p = 0.03, R(2)beta* =0.05). By contrast, we found no
      significant relationships between SW amplitude and NODDI metrics. CONCLUSIONS:
      Our findings suggest that the complexity of neurite organisation contributes
      specifically to the rate of fast switcher SW occurrence in healthy middle-aged
      individuals, corroborating slow and fast switcher SW as distinct types of SW.
      They further suggest that the density of frontal neurites plays a key role for
      neural synchronisation during sleep.

TI  - The effect of dietary fat consumption on Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis in
      mouse models.
PG  - 293
LID - 10.1038/s41398-022-02067-w [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a fatal cognitive disorder with proteinaceous brain
      deposits, neuroinflammation, cerebrovascular dysfunction, and extensive neuronal 
      loss over time. AD is a multifactorial disease, and lifestyle factors, including 
      diet, are likely associated with the development of AD pathology. Since obesity
      and diabetes are recognized as risk factors for AD, it might be predicted that a 
      high-fat diet (HFD) would worsen AD pathology. However, modeling HFD-induced
      obesity in AD animal models has yielded inconclusive results. Some studies report
      a deleterious effect of HFD on Abeta accumulation, neuroinflammation, and
      cognitive function, while others report that HFD worsens memory without affecting
      AD brain pathology. Moreover, several studies report no major effect of HFD on
      AD-related phenotypes in mice, while other studies show that HFD might, in fact, 
      be protective. The lack of a clear association between dietary fat consumption
      and AD-related pathology and cognitive function in AD mouse models might be
      explained by experimental variations, including AD mouse model, sex and age of
      the animals, composition of the HFD, and timeline of HFD consumption. In this
      review, we summarize recent studies that aimed at elucidating the effect of
      HFD-induced obesity on AD-related pathology in mice and provide an overview of
      the factors that may have contributed to the results reported in these studies.
      Based on the heterogeneity of these animal model studies and given that the human
      population itself is quite disparate, it is likely that people will benefit most 
      from individualized nutritional plans based on their medical history and clinical
      profiles.

TI  - Elucidating the binding and inhibitory potential of p-coumaric acid against
      amyloid fibrillation and their cytotoxicity: Biophysical and docking analysis.

AB  - P-Coumaric acid (p-CA) is a plant metabolite with anti-inflammatory and
      antioxidant effects. Due to its therapeutic potential, p-CA has attracted much
      attention from the scientific community lately. Oxidative stress, amyloid
      formation, and impaired proteasomal degradation are hallmarks of
      neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's (AD) and are targets for developing
      therapeutics against such conditions. Here, we have investigated the
      anti-amyloidogenic properties of p-coumaric acid on hen egg white lysozyme
      (HEWL). Heat, pH, and agitation (55 degrees C, pH2.0, 600rpm) stress were used to
      induce amyloid formation in lysozyme. The aggregates characterization was done by
      turbidity, Rayleigh light scattering (RLS), and thioflavin-T (ThT) assays.
      Moreover, ANS (1-anilino naphthalene sulphate) binding assay and circular
      dichroism (CD) were employed to unveil protein hydrophobicity and secondary
      structure perturbation, respectively. Lysozyme demonstrated increased
      hydrophobicity and transition of alpha-helix to beta-sheet under aggregating
      conditions. Moreover, co-incubation of lysozyme with p-coumaric acid attenuates
      the process of amyloid in a concentration dependent manner. At 50 and 200muM
      concentrations of p-coumaric acid, lysozyme retained its native-like folded
      structure. Cytotoxicity protection on human SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cell line was
      also observed using MTT assay and phase contrast microscopy. In addition,
      transmission electron microscopy (TEM) reaffirms the fibrillar nature of lysozyme
      aggregates and their attenuation by p-coumaric acid. The steady state
      fluorescence revealed that the mode of fluorescence quenching for the
      HEWL-p-coumaric acid interaction is static rather than dynamic. Moderate strength
      of binding in order of 10(4)M(-1) exists between HEWL and p-coumaric acid.
      Thermodynamic parameters (H and S) obtained from van't Hoff plot suggested
      spontaneous reaction with hydrophobic interaction. A slight micro-environmental
      change in HEWL around Tyr residue was observed during the binding process with
      the help of synchronous fluorescence. Molecular docking analysis reported the
      involvement of amino acid residues (TRP63, LEU75, ASP101, LYS97) to form a
      complex between HEWL-p-coumaric acid. The observed anti-amyloidogenic and
      inherent antioxidative properties of p-coumaric acid could be helpful to design a
      neuroprotective agent.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by an
      expansion of CAG repeats in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene. Accumulating evidence
      suggests that the microtubule-associated tau protein participates in the
      pathogenesis of HD. Recently, we have identified changes in tau alternative
      splicing of exons 2, 3 and 10 in the putamen of HD patients (St-Amour et al,
      2018). In this study, we sought to determine whether tau mis-splicing events were
      equally observed in other brain regions that are less prone to neurodegeneration.
      Using Western blot and PCR, we characterized the relationship between MAPT
      splicing of exons 2, 3 and 10, tauopathy and Htt pathologies, as well as
      neurodegeneration markers in matching putamen and cortical samples from HD (N =
      48) and healthy control (N = 25) subjects. We first show that levels of 4R-tau
      (exon 10 inclusion) isoforms are higher in both the putamen and the cortex of
      individuals with HD, consistent with earlier findings. On the other hand, higher 
      0N-tau (exclusion of exons 2 and 3) and lower 1N-tau (exclusion of exon 3)
      isoforms were seen exclusively in the putamen of HD individuals. Interestingly,
      investigated splicing factors were deregulated in both regions whereas exon 2
      differences coincided with increased tau hyperphosphorylation, aggregation and
      markers of neurodegeneration. Overall, these results imply a differential
      regulation of tau exon 2 and exon 10 alternative splicing in HD putamen that
      could provide a useful biomarker or therapeutic target.

TI  - Right Temporal Lobe Variant of Frontotemporal Dementia: Systematic Review.
LID - 10.1097/WAD.0000000000000511 [doi]
AB  - Frontotemporal dementia corresponds to a heterogenous group of syndromes
      characterized by progressive changes in behavior and/or language. Approximately
      30% of patients with primary progressive aphasia, semantic variant (semantic
      dementia), present with atrophy in the right cerebral hemisphere, in a rare
      clinical condition called right temporal variant of frontotemporal dementia
      (rtvFTD). The objective of the study is to present the main demographic,
      clinical, neuropsychological, neuroimaging, and pathologic characteristics of
      rtvFTD patients. A systematic review of the literature was carried out in the
      PubMed, LILACS, and SCIELO databases between January and March 2022. After the
      evaluation process, 41 articles were selected, published between 1993 and 2021.
      We found that rtvFTD presents with severe and progressive prosopagnosia (related 
      to anterior temporal lobe injury) associated with behavioral
      symptoms-desinibition (51%), apathy (39%), obsessive-compulsive symptoms (37%),
      changes in eating habits (33%), and depression (28%), which is different from
      semantic dementia. The most common pathologic pattern is TDP-43, type C. This
      field of knowledge has few studies (mainly reports and case series) and
      heterogenous nomenclature, which is a limitation. A multinational longitudinal
      registry of people with rtvFTD, with standardized assessment and description of
      symptoms, is necessary to elucidate the characteristics of this entity.

TI  - Association of Being Accompanied at Medical Consultation and Having Memory
      Complaints With Cognitive Impairment in Elderly Brazilian Outpatients.
LID - 10.1097/WAD.0000000000000521 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The usefulness of both the presence of a companion at the medical
      consultation and patient's cognitive complaints as selection strategies for
      performing a dementia evaluation is still unclear. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the
      association of elderly patients being accompanied during medical visits and
      patient's memory complaint with objective cognitive impairment. METHODS: We
      included elderly outpatients awaiting medical consultations in 3 non-neurological
      medical specialties. Demographic and Mini-Mental State Examination were
      collected. Patients' memory complaints were evaluated with a single question to
      both patients and companions. RESULTS: Five hundred ninety-three elderly patients
      were included in the study with 64.6% female and median (interquartile range) age
      73 (68-78), 4 (2-6) years of education. Of these, 242 patients were accompanied
      and 62.6% presented memory complaints. The median (interquartile range)
      Mini-Mental State Examination scores were significantly lower in patients
      accompanied and in those with memory complaints. In a logistic regression model, 
      age, education, memory complaint, and presence of companion were associated with 
      cognitive impairment. In the model including only accompanied patients, only age 
      and companion memory complaints were associated with objective cognitive
      impairment. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of a companion during a clinical
      consultation and patients' memory complaints are both synergistically associated 
      with objective cognitive impairment.

      Baseline Predict Progression to Cognitive Impairment.
LID - 10.1097/WAD.0000000000000520 [doi]
AB  - Some patients with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) progress to neurocognitive 
      disorders (NCD), whereas others remain stable; however, the neuropsychological
      determinants of this progression have not been identified. Our objective was to
      examine baseline neuropsychological indicators that could discriminate between
      stable SCD Versus progression toward an NCD. We retrospectively included patients
      consulting for SCD at a university medical center's memory center (Amiens,
      France) who had undergone 3 or more neuropsychological assessments. Among the 80 
      patients with SCD, 11 had progressed to an NCD. The combination of age, memory,
      and speed scores at the baseline assessment predicted the progression of SCD with
      a sensitivity of 91%, and a negative predictive value of 98%. The present results
      constitute a first step (pending prospective studies) toward helping physicians
      to identify cases of SCD at risk of progression and, in particular, identifying
      patients with SCD who will not progress by examining baseline neuropsychological 
      indicators. ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT04880252.

TI  - Examining the Role of Aging Perceptions in Subjective Cognitive Decline.
LID - 10.1097/WAD.0000000000000518 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: While subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is gaining ground as a
      "preclinical" risk state for Alzheimer disease, its utility depends on our
      understanding of the factors linked to SCD. Rarely examined sociocultural factors
      including perceptions of aging may relate to the subjective experience of
      cognitive aging. Identifying such associations will help to refine the utility of
      SCD as an early marker of AD while setting the stage for addressing modifiable
      factors contributing to SCD. METHODS: The study consisted of N=136 participants
      (68% female; 73% White; 22% Black race, agemean=74.72; educationmean=16.01).
      Questionnaires assessed SCD, depressive symptoms, and age perceptions
      (essentialist aging beliefs, subjective age, age group identification, and
      explicit/implicit age stereotypes). Cognitive functioning was measured with a
      semantic interference and learning task. RESULTS: SCD was correlated with
      essentialist aging beliefs, age identification, and depressive symptoms
      [rrange=0.18 to 0.22, Prange=0.009 to 0.02, confidence interval
      (CI)range=0.00-0.39]. Essentialist aging beliefs were correlated with subjective 
      age and age group identification (rrange=0.22 to 0.42, Prange<0.001 to 0.003,
      CIrange=0.08-0.57). Both age group identification and essentialism were
      correlated with depressive symptoms (rrange=0.22, Prange=0.009 to 0.01,
      CIrange=0.04-0.39). In the adjusted regression model including depressive
      symptoms, age perceptions, and SCD, only SCD was associated with cognition
      (b=-0.31, P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Although correlated with SCD, perceptions of
      aging do not explain the relationship between SCD and performance on a sensitive 
      cognitive test among older adults.

      neuropathological outcomes.
LID - awac250 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/brain/awac250 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease biomarkers are widely accepted as surrogate markers of
      underlying neuropathological changes. However, few studies have evaluated whether
      preclinical Alzheimer's disease biomarkers predict Alzheimer's neuropathology at 
      autopsy. We sought to determine whether amyloid PET imaging or CSF biomarkers
      accurately predict cognitive outcomes and Alzheimer's disease neuropathological
      findings. This study included 720 participants, 42 to 91 years of age, who were
      enrolled in longitudinal studies of memory and aging in the Washington University
      Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center and were cognitively normal at baseline,
      underwent amyloid PET imaging and/or CSF collection within one year of baseline
      clinical assessment, and had subsequent clinical follow-up. Cognitive status was 
      assessed longitudinally by Clinical Dementia Rating(R). Biomarker status was
      assessed using predefined cut-offs for amyloid PET imaging or CSF
      p-tau181/amyloid-beta42. 57 participants subsequently died and underwent
      neuropathologic examination. Alzheimer's disease neuropathological changes were
      assessed using standard criteria. We assessed the predictive value of Alzheimer's
      disease biomarker status on progression to cognitive impairment and for presence 
      of AD neuropathological changes. Among cognitively normal participants with
      positive biomarkers, 34.4% developed cognitive impairment (Clinical Dementia
      Rating > 0) as compared to 8.4% of those with negative biomarkers. Cox
      proportional hazards modeling indicated that preclinical Alzheimer disease
      biomarker status, APOE varepsilon4 carrier status, polygenic risk score, and
      centered age influenced risk of developing cognitive impairment. Among autopsied 
      participants, 90.9% of biomarker-positive participants and 8.6% of
      biomarker-negative participants had Alzheimer disease neuropathological changes. 
      Sensitivity was 87.0%, specificity 94.1%, positive predictive value 90.9% and
      negative predictive value 91.4% for detection of Alzheimer disease
      neuropathological changes by preclinical biomarkers. Single CSF and amyloid PET
      baseline biomarkers were also predictive of Alzheimer's disease neuropathological
      changes, as well as Thal phase and Braak stage of pathology at autopsy.
      Biomarker-negative participants who developed cognitive impairment were more
      likely to exhibit non-Alzheimer disease pathology at autopsy. The detection of
      preclinical Alzheimer disease biomarkers is strongly predictive of future

AB  - Synapses represent an important target of Alzheimer disease (AD), and alterations
      of their excitability are among the earliest changes associated with AD
      development. Synaptic activation has been shown to be protective in models of AD,
      and deep brain stimulation (DBS), a surgical strategy that modulates neuronal
      activity to treat neurological and psychiatric disorders, produced positive
      effects in AD patients. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the
      protective role(s) of brain stimulation are still elusive. We have previously
      demonstrated that induction of synaptic activity exerts protection in mouse
      models of AD and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) by enhancing the
      macroautophagy/autophagy flux and lysosomal degradation of pathological MAPT/Tau.
      We now provide evidence that TFEB (transcription factor EB), a master regulator
      of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy, is a key mediator of this cellular
      response. In cultured primary neurons from FTD-transgenic mice, synaptic
      stimulation inhibits MTORC1 signaling, thus promoting nuclear translocation of
      TFEB, which, in turn, induces clearance of MAPT/Tau oligomers. Conversely,
      synaptic activation fails to promote clearance of toxic MAPT/Tau in neurons
      expressing constitutively active RRAG GTPases, which sequester TFEB in the
      cytosol, or upon TFEB depletion. Activation of TFEB is also confirmed in vivo in 
      DBS-stimulated AD mice. We also demonstrate that DBS reduces pathological
      MAPT/Tau and promotes neuroprotection in Parkinson disease patients with
      tauopathy. Altogether our findings indicate that stimulation of synaptic activity
      promotes TFEB-mediated clearance of pathological MAPT/Tau. This mechanism,
      underlying the protective effect of DBS, provides encouraging support for the use
      of synaptic stimulation as a therapeutic treatment against tauopathies.

TI  - eHealth and Web-Based Interventions for Informal Carers of People With Dementia
      in the Community: Umbrella Review.
PG  - e36727
LID - 10.2196/36727 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of dementia is increasing, and there are many
      associated problems that family members face as informal carers, including
      emotional, physical, and financial difficulties. There are benefits for a person 
      with dementia to live at home for as long as possible, and therefore, supporting 
      their informal carers is crucial. The growing interest in supporting carers
      through internet-based interventions is evidenced by the volume of systematic
      reviews on this topic. It is now appropriate to systematically examine this body 
      of work and provide an overview of the literature. OBJECTIVE: This umbrella
      review aimed to identify the most effective internet-based intervention content
      and delivery method to support those caring for someone with dementia living in
      the community. METHODS: PsycINFO, Web of Science, CINAHL, MEDLINE, Cochrane
      Library, and PubMed were searched for systematic reviews examining the
      effectiveness of web-based interventions for informal carers of people with
      dementia. A total of 3 reviewers extracted data and evaluated the quality of the 
      papers. To ascertain the extent to which the systematic reviews reported on the
      same evidence, the proportion of overlap between their included studies was
      calculated. Qualitative research findings were extracted and reported. RESULTS: A
      total of 21 papers were included in the study. The quality of the review papers
      was mainly rated as low to moderate, and 10% (2/21) of papers were of high
      quality. The findings suggest that multicomponent interventions were the most
      effective in supporting carers. These included combinations of cognitive
      behavioral therapy and relaxation strategies, educational resources, and online
      support groups. Interventions that were delivered on the web but included
      sessions with a personal element, such as telephone contact, showed the best
      results. When comparing the studies reviewed in all the review papers, a moderate
      overlap was noted. However, when comparing individual reviews with each other,
      they showed a high overlap of the included studies. CONCLUSIONS: Mixed delivery
      methods and intervention content showed the most effective results in supporting 
      those caring for people with dementia. However, many papers do not separate the
      results for differing intervention contents or delivery; this needs to be
      considered when drawing conclusions. There was an overlap among the studies
      included in the reviews. This suggests a lack of current research on the
      effectiveness of web-based interventions for people caring for a person with
      dementia. There was also a lack of consistency in the outcome measures across all
      papers. Future studies can involve updating research on the effectiveness of
      these interventions while distinguishing between different intervention types,
      thus creating guidelines for the use of standardized measures to enable
      comparisons of intervention effects and improve the scientific quality of the
      overall research. TRIAL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42021241559;

TI  - Vitamin D intake and cognitive decline in Blacks and Whites: The role of diet and
      supplements.
LID - 10.1002/alz.12729 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: To determine the role of vitamin D intake on cognitive decline
      among Blacks and Whites. METHODS: Using data from the population-based Chicago
      Health and Aging Project, we studied 2061 Blacks and 1329 Whites with dietary
      vitamin D data and cognitive testing over 12 years of follow-up. Multivariable
      linear mixed-effects models were used to determine the association of vitamin D
      intake with cognitive decline. RESULTS: Vitamin D intake, particularly dietary
      vitamin D, was associated with a slower rate of decline in cognitive function
      among Blacks. In Blacks, comparing individuals in the lowest tertile of dietary
      intake, those in the highest tertile had a slower cognitive decline of 0.017
      units/year (95% confidence interval 0.006, 0.027), independently of
      supplementation use. In Whites, vitamin D intake was not associated with
      cognitive decline. DISCUSSION: Dietary vitamin D may help to slow the decline in 
      cognitive abilities among Blacks as they age.

TI  - Empowering interventions for people living with dementia: A European survey.
LID - 10.1111/jan.15385 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: We aim to identify existing empowerment interventions for people living
      with dementia and to explore which used interventions and projects are considered
      empowering and why. DESIGN: This was an online survey. METHODS: We conducted an
      online survey between May 2018 and July 2018 amongst professionals interested in 
      dementia care in Europe. Interventions were clustered within the ecological model
      for health promotion. Reasons from respondents as to why they considered
      interventions to be empowering were analysed and structured according to a
      recently developed conceptual framework of empowerment for people living with
      dementia. RESULTS: Seventy-three respondents from 23 countries together mentioned
      98 interventions or projects, of which 90 were unique. Interventions focused on
      the (inter)personal (n = 54), organizational (n = 15), communal (n = 6) and
      societal (n = 15) levels. A broad range of interventions were considered
      empowering, but no interventions were specifically developed for, nor aimed at,
      empowerment. Reasons as to why respondents considered these interventions as
      empowering fitted the framework's domains. CONCLUSION: This European survey
      provides insights into interventions considered empowering for people living with
      dementia. An important step that needs to be taken is to develop and test
      interventions that specifically aim to promote empowerment for people living with
      dementia. IMPACT: Empowerment may encourage people with dementia to live the life
      they choose, and focus on what is possible, instead of what is no longer
      possible. Many interventions are considered as empowering for people living with 
      dementia, however no interventions could be identified that were specifically
      developed for or aimed at empowerment. This study shows that for promoting
      empowerment, it is necessary to develop and test interventions that specifically 
      aim for empowerment, do this in collaboration with relevant stakeholders, and in 
      this way support people living with dementia to live according to their
      competencies, talents and wishes.

TI  - Neuroimaging analyses from a randomized, controlled study to evaluate plasma
      exchange with albumin replacement in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease:
      additional results from the AMBAR study.
LID - 10.1007/s00259-022-05915-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study was designed to detect structural and functional brain
      changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients treated with therapeutic plasma
      exchange (PE) with albumin replacement, as part of the recent AMBAR phase 2b/3
      clinical trial. METHODS: Mild-to-moderate AD patients were randomized into four
      arms: three arms receiving PE with albumin (one with low-dose albumin, and two
      with low/high doses of albumin alternated with IVIG), and a placebo (sham PE)
      arm. All arms underwent 6 weeks of weekly conventional PE followed by 12 months
      of monthly low-volume PE. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumetric analyses
      and regional and statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analysis on
      (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ((18)FDG-PET) were
      performed. RESULTS: MRI analyses (n = 198 patients) of selected subcortical
      structures showed fewer volume changes from baseline to final visit in the high
      albumin + IVIG treatment group (p < 0.05 in 3 structures vs. 4 to 9 in other
      groups). The high albumin + IVIG group showed no statistically significant
      reduction of right hippocampus. SPM (18)FDG-PET analyses (n = 213 patients)
      showed a worsening of metabolic activity in the specific areas affected in AD
      (posterior cingulate, precuneus, and parieto-temporal regions). The high-albumin 
      + IVIG treatment group showed the greatest metabolic stability over the course of
      the study, i.e., the smallest percent decline in metabolism (MaskAD), and least
      progression of defect compared to placebo. CONCLUSIONS: PE with albumin
      replacement was associated with fewer deleterious changes in subcortical
      structures and less metabolic decline compared to the typical of the progression 
      of AD. This effect was more marked in the group treated with high albumin + IVIG.

TI  - The AT(N) system for describing biological changes in Alzheimer's disease: a
      plain language summary.
LID - 10.2217/nmt-2022-0013 [doi]
AB  - WHAT IS THIS SUMMARY ABOUT?: This is a plain language summary of an article
      published in Nature Reviews Neurology. It explains how Alzheimer's disease is
      diagnosed. It also looks at whether a newer way to assess people with Alzheimer's
      disease could help improve how the condition is diagnosed, monitored, and
      treated. WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?: Alzheimer's disease is a long-term progressive
      brain disease that leads to difficulties with thinking and memory. It is a
      progressive condition, which means it gets worse over time. Biological changes
      occur in the brain of people with Alzheimer's disease. This includes a build-up
      of toxic protein clusters called amyloid plaques and tau tangles, gradual damage 
      to the brain cells (neurodegeneration), and brain shrinkage due to loss of
      neurons. It is often due to multiple factors and doctors usually diagnose
      Alzheimer's disease by looking at a person's symptoms and ruling out other causes
      of dementia. However, research shows that people diagnosed in this way do not
      always have the biological changes in the brain that are related to Alzheimer's
      disease. This means that some people may be misdiagnosed. Additionally, there may
      be a delay in the appearance of Alzheimer's symptoms, by which point changes in
      the brain may be severe. For example, people with Alzheimer's disease show
      biological changes in the brain, years before symptoms appear. WHAT ARE THE KEY
      TAKEAWAYS?: An assessment of biological changes in the brain, by measuring
      substances that indicate disease progress (biomarkers), may offer a fuller
      picture of a person's Alzheimer's disease, how advanced it is, and which
      treatments are likely to work best. A recently developed classification scheme
      known as the AT(N) system provides a way to assess and describe the biological
      changes in amyloid (A), tau (T), and neurodegeneration (N) that occur in people
      with Alzheimer's disease. The goal is to include biomarker testing in clinical
      practice to help physicians and practitioners diagnose, monitor, and treat people
      with Alzheimer's disease more effectively. The AT(N) system is being used for
      various purposes in clinical studies, and has the potential to assist physicians 
      and practitioners in early detection, accurate diagnosis, staging, and treatment 
      selection for people with Alzheimer's disease.

TI  - Apolipoprotein E polymorphisms in adults over 60 years of age with mild cognitive
      impairment and Alzheimer's disease in different Venezuelan populations
PG  - 116-129
LID - 10.7705/biomedica.5889 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Alzheimer's disease represents a serious public health problem that
      tends to worsen over time. Among the most important genetic predisposing factors 
      is the presence of the epsilon4 allele of the apoprotein E gene (APOE).
      Objective: To determine the allelic and genotypic frequencies of the APOE
      isoforms in adults over 60 years old with mild cognitive impairment and
      Alzheimer's disease in Gran Caracas and in the indigenous Pemon community of the 
      Kamarata-Kanaimo area, Bolivar State. Materials and methods: We studied 267
      patients: 96 controls, 40 with mild cognitive impairment, 108 with Alzheimer's
      from Caracas, and 23 individuals from Kamarata-Kanaimo. The APOE isoforms were
      determined with the AP1210Z: Seeplex(R) ApoE Genotyping kit. Results: The allele 
      epsilon4 showed a significant association with mild cognitive impairment
      (OR=5.03; 95% CI: 0.98-25.70) and EA (OR=5.78; 95% CI: 1.24-26.85). The genotype 
      frequencies for the control and mild cognitive impairment groups were
      epsilon3/epsilon3> epsilon3/epsilon4> epsilon2/epsilon4> epsilon3/epsilon2>
      epsilon4/epsilon4, and for the Alzheimer's group, epsilon3/epsilon3>
      epsilon3/epsilon4> epsilon4/epsilon4> epsilon2/epsilon4> epsilon3/epsilon2 In
      Kamarata-Kanaimo, the order was epsilon3/epsilon3> epsilon3/epsilon4>
      epsilon4/epsilon4; the allele epsilon2 was not found in this group. Conclusions: 
      APOE allelic and genotypic frequencies in our sample showed a similar
      distribution to those found in other studies in Venezuela and the Americas. The
      absence of the epsilon2 allele in the indigenous community of Kamarata-Kanaimo
      warrants further investigation. The positive association of the epsilon4 allele
      with both Alzheimer's and mild cognitive impairment was reinforced. The early
      determination of the epsilon4 allele carriers can help establish preventive
      measures in our population.

TI  - The use of lumbar puncture and safety recommendations in Alzheimer's disease: a
      plain language summary.
LID - 10.2217/nmt-2022-0012 [doi]
AB  - WHAT IS THIS SUMMARY ABOUT?: This is a plain language summary of an article
      published in Alzheimer's & Dementia. It looks at a type of test called a lumbar
      puncture (also known as spinal tap) used in people suspected of having
      Alzheimer's disease or some other form of dementia. This summary focuses on how
      to do a lumbar puncture safely. WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?: Alzheimer's disease is a 
      progressive condition, which means it gets worse over time. This leads to
      difficulties with thinking and memory. People with Alzheimer's disease show a
      build up of proteins called amyloid-beta and tau in the brain. This is followed
      by a gradual loss of brain cells and brain function. The changes in the brain are
      thought to occur years before symptoms appear. Lumbar puncture is a medical
      procedure during which samples of cerebrospinal fluid are collected. In
      Alzheimer's disease, it is used to examine cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers that
      can help diagnose disease. Lumbar puncture is traditionally considered as a
      painful and invasive procedure with frequent side effects. However, multiple
      studies indicate that a lumbar puncture can be performed safely. Side effects are
      typically mild and do not require specialist intervention. WHAT ARE THE KEY
      TAKEAWAYS?: Despite the low risk of serious complications associated with a
      lumbar puncture, physicians and their patients may be reluctant to recommend or
      undergo this procedure. Patient education, specialist training, as well as new
      methods concerning patient safety are important factors to support the widespread
      use of lumbar puncture in Alzheimer's disease.

TI  - Double-negative T cells mediate M1 polarization of microglial cells via
      TNF-alpha-NLRP3 to aggravate neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment in
      Alzheimer's disease mice.
LID - 10.1002/jcp.30839 [doi]
AB  - We mainly study the role and regulatory mechanism of double-negative T cells
      (DNTs) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The mice splenic DNTs were separated and
      amplified by Rosettesep antibody adsorption method and Easysep magnetic activated
      cell sorting. DNTs were intraperitoneally injected into the APP/PS1-AD mice
      model, which was found to aggravate cognitive impairment in mice. DNTs secreted
      tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) to promote the activation of NLRP3 and
      the M1 polarization of microglial cells, and silencing NLRP3 with small
      interfering RNA (siRNA) suppressed the effect of DNTs. DNTs were later cocultured
      with mice microglial cell line BV2, then fluorescence staining was conducted to
      detect NLRP3 expression, and enzyme-linked immunoassay was performed to measure
      the expression of inflammatory factors. Moreover, the levels of NLRP3, ASC, and
      TNFR1 proteins were detected by western-blot assay, and the proportion of F4/80 +
      CD11b + M1 cells was detected by flow cytometry. DNTs promoted the M1
      polarization of BV2 cells and the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. After
      treatment of BV2 cells with NLRP3 inhibitor, the effect of DNTs was weakened.
      Later, TNF-alpha siRNA was transfected into DNTs, and it was found that DNTs with
      TNF-alpha silencing had markedly weakened polarization effect on BV2 cells. We
      discovered that the proportion of DNTs increased in AD patients. DNTs secreted
      TNF-alpha to regulate the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and the M1
      polarization of microglial cells, thus promoting the central inflammatory
      response and aggravating the cognitive impairment in AD mice.

      21 with population in a Chinese community.
PG  - e2709
LID - 10.1002/brb3.2709 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Subjective cognitive decline-questionnaire 9 (SCD-Q9) was developed
      to detect SCD complaints at risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, our
      previous findings indicated that its coverage might be insufficient. To test this
      hypothesis, we recently translated SCD-Q21. OBJECTIVE: To examine the reliability
      and validity of this translated SCD-Q21 and to explore its effectiveness for
      discriminating MCI from controls. METHODS: Item analysis was performed to
      understand its item discrimination and homogeneity. The Cronbach's alpha and
      Spearman-Brown's split-half coefficients were calculated to test its reliability.
      The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) value, Bartlett's sphericity test, and exploratory
      factor analysis (EFA) were used to examine its construct validity. The content
      validity was evaluated using five-grade Likert scale. Finally, the SCD-Q21 scores
      in MCI and controls were compared. RESULTS: The difference of each item between
      the extreme groups was significant. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient was .913 and
      Spearman-Brown's split-half coefficient was .894. When performing holding one-out
      approach, the Cronbach's alpha coefficient ranged from .906 to .914. The KMO
      value was .929 and the difference of Bartlett's Sphericity test was significant. 
      All experts scored 5 points when assessing its content. Finally, a significant
      difference of score was found between MCI and NC groups. CONCLUSIONS: The
      reliability and validity of the SCD-Q21 are good, which may pave a way for its
      application in a wider Chinese-speaking population.

      Improvement of Gut Microbiota.
PG  - 2515690X221114657

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder is
      the most common form of dementia globally. Several studies have suggested
      alteration in the gut microbiota and HSV-1 infection as contributing factors to
      the development of the disease. As at now, there are no AD attenuating agents and
      AD pharmacotherapy is focused on managing symptoms while plants used in
      ethnomedicine remain potential sources of drugs for the treatment of the
      condition. Here, we reviewed published databases for African ethnomedicinal
      plants and functional foods of African origin that are used in the management of 
      AD-related phenotypes, treatment of herpes simplex virus -1 (HSV-1) and/or
      improvement of gut microbiota. A total of 101 unique plant species and 24
      different types of traditionally prepared African functional foodstuff were
      identified. Of the 101 identified plant species, 50 species serve as functional
      foodstuffs. Twenty-three (23) of the ethnomedicinal plant families were
      successfully identified for the treatment and management of AD-related phenotypes
      and age-related dementia. Eighteen (18) African plant species from 15 families
      were also identified as potent remedies for HSV-1; while many African wild fruits
      (3 species), roots and tubers (7 species), leafy vegetables (14 species), and
      seaweeds (26 species) were functional foods for modifying AD-related phenotypes. 
      It was concluded that African medicinal plants are potential sources of both AD
      attenuating agents and phytocompounds that may be used against HSV-1 infection
      and alteration of gut microbiota. Additionally, a number of African functional
      foods are important sources of prebiotics and probiotics.

TI  - Western Agarose Native GeELution (WANGEL) with beta-amyloid and tau: Novel method
      to elute proteins or peptides using native agarose gels followed by Lumipulse
      assay.
PG  - 101779
LID - 10.1016/j.mex.2022.101779 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer s disease is characterized by hyperphosphorylated tau neurofibrillary
      tangles and beta-amyloid plaques. Both molecules can be easily measured in human 
      fluids or tissue extracts by immunoassays. However, the different molecular
      weight species can only be differentiated on Western Blot gels. Analysis of
      native proteins from polyacrylamide gels is also not well characterized. Hence,
      we developed a modified method to elute proteins or peptides from native agarose 
      gels. Initially, full-length tau (60 kDa) and beta-amyloid(42) (4 kDa) were
      separated on a Western Blot gel and eluted from native agarose gels (WANGEL)
      using an elution system inside a polypropylene tube. The eluates were analyzed
      with the Lumipulse immunoassay. Both molecules were successfully eluted into 1%
      agarose gels to the cathode and were detected in the eluate. Additionally, tau
      was eluted from mouse cortical extracts, but was below the detection limit when
      eluted from human cerebrospinal fluid. Beta-amyloid(40) was eluted from CSF
      extracts and detected by Lumipulse. In cortical extracts taken from transgenic
      mice (APP_SweDI) beta-amyloid(42) was detectable as a native peptide and small
      oligomeric aggregates. Taken together, our novel WANGEL method enables fast, easy
      and cheap elution of protein/peptides from polyacrylamide/agarose gels with a
      subsequent analysis by Lumipulse immunoassay. Three bullet points:*Beta-amyloid
      and tau are major hallmarks in Alzheimer s disease and are established
      cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers.*Lumipulse is a method to measure beta-amyloid and
      tau in cerebrospinal fluid in the pg/mL range.*Western Blot and our novel
      combined native agarose method (WANGEL) allows an easy and fast determination of 
      the molecular size in combination with Lumipulse.

PG  - 119
LID - 10.31083/j.jin2104119 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Machine learning techniques and magnetic resonance imaging methods
      have been widely used in computer-aided diagnosis and prognosis of severe brain
      diseases such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer, etc. Methods: In this paper, a
      regularized multi-task learning method for schizophrenia classification is
      proposed, and three MRI datasets of schizophrenia, collected from different data 
      centers, are investigated. Firstly, slice extraction is used in image
      preprocessing. Then texture features of gray-level co-occurrence matrices are
      extracted from the above processed images. Finally, a p-norm regularized
      multi-task learning method is proposed to simultaneously learn the site-specific 
      and site-shared features of the multi-site data, which can effectively
      discriminate schizophrenia patients from normal controls. RESULTS: The
      classification error rate on 10 datasets can be reduced from 10% to 30%.
      CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method obtains excellent results and provides objective
      evidence for clinical diagnosis and treatment of schizophrenia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is an
      important modulator of innate immune responses. In the human brain, TREM2 is
      primarily expressed on microglia and is involved in cell survival, phagocytosis, 
      and regulation of inflammation. TREM2 dysfunction has been linked to the
      pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease 
      (AD). Rare coding variants of the TREM2 gene have been reported to modulate AD
      risk in several populations, however, data on their association with
      susceptibility to AD in the Slovak population have been missing. METHODS: We have
      analyzed 10 non-synonymous coding variants located in TREM2 exon 2 by direct
      sequencing in 270 late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) patients and 331
      controls. RESULTS: Four out of 10 TREM2 mutant variants have been identified in
      the analyzed groups, namely rs75932628 C > T (R47H), rs142232675 C > T (D87N),
      rs143332484 C > T (R62H), and rs2234253 G > T (T96K). R47H was found only in the 
      AD group, while T96K was present only in the controls. Although no significant
      association between TREM2 coding variants and LOAD susceptibility has been
      detected, the observed odds ratio (OR) of 3.69 for R47H carriers suggests an
      increased risk of LOAD for this variant in the Slovak population. Moreover, we
      also found a higher OR for the rs143332484-T allele in APOEepsilon4 non-carriers 
      (1.99) when compared to APOEepsilon4 carriers (0.62). CONCLUSIONS: Our results
      suggest an impact of specific TREM2 rare coding variants on AD risk in the Slovak
      population.

TI  - Multi-domain Cognitive Testing: A Biomarker for Classifying the Cognitive Status

AB  - Context: Cognition is impaired in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and patients with mild
      cognitive impairment (MCI) with varying levels of magnitude. Aim: The present
      study aimed to identify a biomarker for classifying MCI and AD using multi-domain
      cognitive testing. Settings and Design: This was a cross-sectional study. Methods
      and Materials: 26 AD patients, 28 MCI patients and 25 controls were recruited.
      Cognitive assessment of different domains was done using standard questionnaires 
      and cognitive function tests. Statistical Analysis Used: Cognitive task scores
      were compared between the groups using multivariate analysis of variance
      (MANOVA). Results: Patients with AD had significantly lower MMSE, CDR, cognitive 
      task scores compared to controls and MCI. Cognitive scores of all tasks for MCI
      were significantly less than controls, except MMSE and digits forward score. ROC 
      analysis showed that picture memory had 100% sensitivity, 91.6% specificity for
      AD and 88.4% sensitivity, 92.5% specificity for MCI. Word memory had 92.3%
      specificity, 100% specificity for AD and 80.7% specificity, 84.6% specificity for
      MCI. Conclusions: The global cognitive tools are less specific in bringing out
      the differences especially between MCI and control. Limitation of MMSE,
      heterogeneity of MCI and differential impairment of various domains of cognition,
      demands the inclusion of multi-domain cognitive evaluation especially picture and
      word memory tasks with high sensitivity and specificity into the existing
      diagnostic protocol. ROC results also suggested the continuum of cognitive
      impairment and MCI as a transitional stage leaving more scope on the quantum of
      research required for intervention to halt the structural and functional decline.

TI  - Is Air Pollution Associated with Increased Risk of Dementia? A Meta-Analysis of
      Epidemiological Research.
PG  - 1004-1019
LID - 10.4103/0028-3886.349654 [doi]
AB  - Background: There are prevailing inconsistencies in epidemiological research
      about air pollution being a risk factor for dementia. Objective: We performed
      meta-analyses to calculate the pooled estimates of the risk of developing
      dementia due to air pollution exposure. Methods and Materials: We performed a
      systematic search in PubMed, Google Scholar, The Cochrane Library, and J-GATEPLUS
      databases for peer-reviewed epidemiological studies reporting the risk of
      developing all-cause dementia, cognitive decline, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and
      vascular dementia (VaD) due to exposure to particulate matter with an aerodynamic
      diameter less than 2.5 mum (PM2.5) and less than 10 mum (PM10), ozone (O3),
      carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitrogen oxides (NOX) and sulfur
      dioxide (SO2) from the beginning until December 2020. Meta-analysis was performed
      by adopting the random-effects model using Meta-XL. Results: In all-cause
      dementia, the pooled hazard ratio (HR) for PM2.5 and NO2 exposure was 1.03
      [(95%CI: 1.01-1.06; I(2) = 99% (P < 0.001)] and 1.00 [(95%CI: 1.00-1.01; I(2) =
      96% (P < 0.001)], respectively. The pooled HR for NOX was 1.00 [(95%CI:
      1.00-1.01; I(2) = 61% (P = 0.05)]. In AD, the pooled HRs for PM2.5 and O3 was
      1.08 (95%CI: 1.01-1.15; I(2) = 99% (P < 0.001)]) and 1.02 (95%CI: 0.96-1.08; I(2)
      = 100% (P < 0.001)], respectively. In VaD, the pooled HR for PM2.5 exposure was
      1.03 (95%CI: 1.01-1.06; I(2) = 91% (P < 0.001)]. In NO2/NOX, the results were
      found to be equivocal. Meta-analysis could not be performed in cognitive decline 
      because of wide variations in assessments methods. Conclusions: The present study
      showed exposure to PM2.5 as a risk factor for all-cause dementia, AD, and VaD and
      exposure to O3 as a possible risk factor for AD. These findings can be used for
      policy measures and further research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dementia and cognitive impairment can be attributed to genetic and
      modifiable factors. Considerable evidence emerged in modifiable factors and
      urgently requires standardized evaluation. We conducted an umbrella review to
      evaluate the strength and validity of the existing evidence. METHODS: We searched
      PubMed, Embase, CINAHL and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews to identify
      relevant systematic reviews and meta-analyses of prospective studies regarding
      the associations of dementia and cognitive impairment with modifiable factors.
      For each association, we analyzed the summary effect size, 95% confidence
      interval, 95% prediction interval, heterogeneity, small study effect and excess
      significance bias. Mendelian randomization studies were descriptively reviewed
      further exploring the causality of the associations. RESULTS: In total, 12,015
      articles were identified, of which 118 eligible studies yielded 243 unique
      associations. Convincing evidence was found for associations of dementia and
      cognitive impairment with early-life education, midlife to late-life plasma
      glucose, BMI, atrial fibrillation, benzodiazepine use, and gait speed. Suggestive
      to highly suggestive evidence was found for that of midlife to late-life blood
      pressure, homocysteine, cerebrovascular diseases, hearing impairment, respiratory
      illness, anemia, smoking, alcohol consumption, diet, sleep, physical activity and
      social engagement. Among convincing evidence, Mendelian randomization studies
      verified causal relationships of education and plasma glucose with Alzheimer's
      disease. LIMITATIONS: Low quality of the studies included. CONCLUSIONS:
      Modifiable risk factors identified in this study, especially those with
      high-level evidence, should be considered in dementia prevention. Our results
      support a valuable rationale for future experimental designs to establish further
      evidence for the associations in larger populations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Subjective or objective subtle cognitive decline (SCD) is considered 
      the preclinical manifestation of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is a potentially
      crucial window for preventing or delaying the progression of the disease.
      METHODS: To explore the potential mechanism of disease progression and identify
      relevant biomarkers, we comprehensively assessed the peripheral blood
      transcriptomic alterations in SCD, covering lncRNA, mRNA, and miRNA. FINDINGS:
      Dysregulated protein-coding mRNA at both gene and isoform levels implicated
      impairment in the type I interferon signaling pathway in SCD. Specifically, this 
      pathway was regulated by the transcription factor STAT1 and ncRNAs NRIR and
      has-miR-146a-5p. The miRNA-mRNA-lncRNA co-expression network revealed hub genes
      for the interferon module. Individuals with lower interferon signaling activity
      and lower expression of a hub gene STAT1 exhibited a higher conversion rate to
      mild cognitive impairment (MCI). INTERPRETATION: Our findings illustrated the
      down-regulation of interferon signaling activity would potentially increase the
      risk of disease progression and thus serve as a pre-disease biomarker. FUNDING:

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The potential impact of sex on cognitive performance in normal aging
      and participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been outlined previously.
      Nevertheless, differences in neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) have been also
      outlined. We aimed to study a potential association between NPS and cognitive
      performances according to sex, in older individuals with and without cognitive
      impairment. METHODS: Demographic, neuropsychiatric and neuropsychological data
      from the ADNI and NACC databases were merged into a dataset of 506 participants
      with healthy cognitive performance, 467 patients with mild cognitive impairment, 
      and 238 patients with AD. Cognitive performance in each group was evaluated
      according to sex and the presence of NPS. RESULTS: Based on sex, cognitive
      performance differed according to clinical stage: in the healthy controls and AD 
      groups, women had better fluency performance, while in the mild cognitive
      impairment group, women had better working memory and men better oral naming.
      Regardless of sex, depression showed a negative effect on processing speed in AD.
      Finally, there was an interaction between sex and NPS in mild cognitive
      impairment, where women with apathy had better working memory performance, and in
      AD, women with depression had better fluency performance. The opposite pattern
      being was observed in men, where men with depression have worse focused
      attention. CONCLUSION: Cognitive performance is influenced by sex, yet this
      influence has different manifestations at normal cognition, MCI or AD.
      Furthermore, apathy and depression seem to influence differently women and men at
      different types of cognitive decline.

      simulations study for the identification of LIM kinase-1 inhibitors.

AB  - LIM kinases (LIMKs) are a family of protein kinases involved in the regulation of
      actin dynamics. There are two isoforms of LIMKs i.e., LIMK1 and LIMK2. LIMK1 is
      expressed abundantly in neuronal tissues. LIMK1 plays an essential role in the
      degradation of dendritic spines, which are important for our higher brain
      functions, such as memory and learning. The inhibition of LIMK1 improves the size
      and density of dendritic spines and acts as a protective effect against
      Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we have adopted ligand-based drug design and 
      molecular modelling methods to identify virtual hits. The pharmacophoric features
      of PF-00477736 were used to screen the Zinc15 compounds library. The identified
      hits were then passed through drug-likeliness and PAINS filters. Further,
      comprehensive docking and rigorous molecular dynamics simulation study afforded
      three virtual hits viz., ZINC504485634, ZINC16940431 and ZINC1091071. The hits
      showed a better docking score than the standard ligand, PF-00477736. The docking 
      score was found to be -8.85, -7.50 and -7.68 kcal/mol. These hits exhibited
      optimal binding properties with the target in docking study, blood-brain barrier 
      permeability, in silico pharmacokinetics and low predicted toxicity.Communicated

AB  - Communication and coordination between primary healthcare professionals and
      informal caregivers involved in the care for frail older adults is suboptimal and
      could benefit from interprofessional digital communication tools. Implementation 
      in daily practice however frequently fails. We aim to identify generic barriers
      and facilitators experienced by healthcare professionals and informal caregivers 
      during implementation of interprofessional communication tools to improve their
      long-term use. Qualitative content analysis using individual semi-structured
      interviews was used for evaluating three different digital communication tools
      used by interprofessional primary care networks for frail older adults by 28
      professionals and 10 caregivers. After transcription and open coding, categories 
      and themes were identified. Barriers and facilitators were related to: tool
      characteristics, context of use, involvement of professionals and caregivers. The
      tool improved availability, approachability and users' involvement. The large
      number of digital systems professionals simultaneously use, and different work
      agreements hampered tool use. The tools facilitated care coordination, and
      professionals declared to be better informed about patients' current situations. 
      Overall, interprofessional digital communication tools can facilitate
      communication in networks for primary elderly care. However, integration between 
      digital systems is needed to reduce the number of tools. Organizations and policy
      makers have an important role in realizing the tools' long-term use.

TI  - Risk factors for dementia in the context of cardiovascular disease: A protocol of
      an overview of reviews.
PG  - e0271611
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0271611 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dementia is a major public health priority. Although there is
      abundant evidence of an association between dementia and poor cardiovascular
      health, findings have been inconsistent and uncertain in identifying which
      factors increase dementia risk in those with cardiovascular disease. Indeed,
      multiple variables including sociodemographic, economic, health, lifestyle and
      education may indicate who is at higher vs. lower dementia risk and could be used
      in prediction modelling. Therefore, the aim of this review is to synthesise
      evidence on the key risk factors for dementia in those with a history of
      cardiovascular disease. METHODS: This is an overview of reviews protocol,
      registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021265363). Four electronic databases including
      MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews will
      be searched. Studies will be included if they are systematic reviews and/or
      meta-analyses that have investigated the risk of incident dementia (all-cause and
      subtypes including Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia) in people with a
      history of coronary heart disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation,
      hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, and vascular stiffness. Study selection will be
      completed by two independent researchers according to the eligibility criteria,
      and conflicts resolved by a third reviewer. References will be exported into
      Covidence for title and abstract sifting, full-text review, and data extraction. 
      Methodological quality will be assessed using the AMSTAR-2 criteria and
      confidence of evidence will be assessed using the GRADE classification. This
      overview of reviews will follow PRISMA guidelines. If there is sufficient
      homogeneity in the data, the results will be pooled, and a meta-analysis
      conducted to determine the strength of association between each risk factor and
      incident all-cause dementia and its subtypes for each cardiovascular diagnoses
      separately. DISCUSSION: We will create a comprehensive summary of the key risk
      factors linking cardiovascular diseases to risk of incident dementia. This
      knowledge is essential for informing risk predictive model development as well as
      the development of risk reduction and prevention strategies.

AB  - Strong genetic evidence supports an imbalance between production and clearance of
      amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) in people with Alzheimer disease (AD). Microglia
      that are potentially involved in alternative mechanisms are actually integral to 
      the amyloid cascade. Fluid biomarkers and brain imaging place accumulation of
      Abeta at the beginning of molecular and clinical changes in the disease. So why
      have clinical trials of anti-amyloid therapies not provided clear-cut benefits to
      patients with AD? Can anti-amyloid therapies robustly decrease Abeta in the human
      brain, and if so, could this lowering be too little, too late? These central
      questions in research on AD are being urgently addressed.

TI  - Harmonizing the preclinical Alzheimer cognitive composite for multicohort
      studies.
LID - 10.1037/neu0000833 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Studies are increasingly examining research questions across multiple
      cohorts using data from the preclinical Alzheimer cognitive composite (PACC). Our
      objective was to use modern psychometric approaches to develop a harmonized PACC.
      METHOD: We used longitudinal data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
      Initiative (ADNI), Harvard Aging Brain Study (HABS), and Australian Imaging,
      Biomarker and Lifestyle Study of Ageing (AIBL) cohorts (n = 2,712). We further
      demonstrated our method with the Anti-Amyloid Treatment of Asymptomatic
      Alzheimer's Disease (A4) Study prerandomized data (n = 4,492). For the
      harmonization method, we used confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) on the final
      visit of the longitudinal cohorts to determine parameters to generate latent PACC
      (lPACC) scores. Overlapping tests across studies were set as "anchors" that tied 
      cohorts together, while parameters from unique tests were freely estimated. We
      performed validation analyses to assess the performance of lPACC versus the
      common standardized PACC (zPACC). RESULTS: Baseline (BL) scores for the zPACC
      were centered on zero, by definition. The harmonized lPACC did not define a
      common mean of zero and demonstrated differences in baseline ability levels
      across the cohorts. Baseline lPACC slightly outperformed zPACC in the prediction 
      of progression to dementia. Longitudinal change in the lPACC was more constrained
      and less variable relative to the zPACC. In combined-cohort analyses,
      longitudinal lPACC slightly outperformed longitudinal zPACC in its association
      with baseline beta-amyloid status. CONCLUSIONS: This study proposes procedures
      for harmonizing the PACC that make fewer strong assumptions than the zPACC,
      facilitating robust multicohort analyses. This implementation of item response
      theory lends itself to adapting across future cohorts with similar composites.

TI  - Atrial Fibrillation and the Risk of Early-Onset Dementia: A Systematic Review and
      Meta-Analysis.
PG  - e025653
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.122.025653 [doi]
AB  - Background Recent studies have identified an increased risk of dementia in
      patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). However, both AF and dementia usually
      manifest late in life. Few studies have investigated this association in adults
      with early-onset dementia. The aim of this study was to investigate the
      relationship between AF and early-onset dementia. Methods and Results We searched
      the PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus databases through April 15, 2022, for
      studies reporting on the association between AF and dementia in adults aged <70
      years, without language restrictions. Two reviewers independently performed the
      study selection, assessed the risk of bias, and extracted the study data. We
      performed a meta-analysis of early-onset dementia risk according to occurrence of
      AF using a random-effects model. We retrieved and screened 1006 potentially
      eligible studies. We examined the full text of 33 studies and selected the 6
      studies that met our inclusion criteria. The pooled analysis of their results
      showed an increased risk of developing dementia in individuals with AF, with a
      summary relative risk of 1.50 (95% CI, 1.00-2.26) in patients aged <70 years, and
      1.06 (95% CI, 0.55-2.06) in those aged <65 years. Conclusions In this systematic 
      review and meta-analysis, AF was a risk factor for dementia in adults aged <70
      years, with an indication of a slight and statistically imprecise excess risk
      already at ages <65 years. Further research is needed to assess which
      characteristics of the arrhythmia and which mechanisms play a role in this
      relationship.

TI  - Cannabinoids to Improve Health-Related Quality of Life in Patients with
      Neurological or Oncological Disease: A Meta-Analysis.
LID - 10.1089/can.2021.0187 [doi]
AB  - Background: Cannabinoids have been suggested to alleviate frequently experienced 
      symptoms of reduced mental well-being such as anxiety and depression. Mental
      well-being is an important subdomain of health-related quality of life (HRQoL).
      Reducing symptoms and maintaining HRQoL are particularly important in malignant
      primary brain tumor patients, as treatment options are often noncurative and
      prognosis remains poor. These patients frequently report unprescribed cannabinoid
      use, presumably for symptom relieve. As studies on brain tumor patients
      specifically are lacking, we performed a meta-analysis of the current evidence on
      cannabinoid efficacy on HRQoL and mental well-being in oncological and
      neurological patients. Methods: We performed a systematic PubMed, PsychINFO,
      Embase, and Web of Science search according to PRISMA guidelines on August 2 and 
      3, 2021. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed the
      effects of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or cannabidiol (CBD) on general HRQoL and
      mental well-being. Pooled effect sizes were calculated using Hedges g. Risk of
      bias of included studies was assessed using Cochrane's Risk of Bias tool.
      Results: We included 17 studies: 4 in oncology and 13 in central nervous system
      (CNS) disease. Meta-analysis showed no effect of cannabinoids on general HRQoL
      (g=-0.02 confidence interval [95% CI -0.11 to 0.06]; p=0.57) or mental well-being
      (g=-0.02 [95% CI -0.16 to 0.13]; p=0.81). Conclusions: RCTs in patients with
      cancer or CNS disease showed no effect of cannabinoids on HRQoL or mental
      well-being. However, studies were clinically heterogeneous and since many glioma 
      patients currently frequently use cannabinoids, future studies are necessary to
      evaluate its value in this specific population.

TI  - Dose-dependent Phosphorylation of Endogenous Tau by Intermittent Hypoxia in Rat
      Brain.
LID - 10.1152/japplphysiol.00332.2022 [doi]
AB  - Intermittent hypoxia, or intermittent low oxygen interspersed with normal oxygen 
      levels, has differential effects that depend on the "dose" of hypoxic episodes
      (duration, severity, number per day, and number of days). Whereas "low dose"
      daily acute intermittent hypoxia (dAIH) elicits neuroprotection and
      neuroplasticity, "high dose" chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) similar to that
      experienced during sleep apnea elicits neuropathology. Sleep apnea is comorbid in
      >50% of patients with Alzheimer's Disease-a progressive, neurodegenerative
      disease associated with brain amyloid and chronic Tau dysregulation (pathology). 
      Although patients with sleep apnea present with higher Tau levels, it is unknown 
      if sleep apnea through attendant CIH contributes to onset of Tau pathology. We
      hypothesized CIH characteristic of moderate sleep apnea would increase
      dysregulation of phosphorylated Tau (phospho-Tau) species in Sprague-Dawley rat
      hippocampus and pre-frontal cortex. Conversely, we hypothesized that dAIH, a
      promising neurotherapeutic, has minimal impact on Tau phosphorylation. We report 
      a dose-dependent intermittent hypoxia effect, with region-specific increases in: 
      1) phospho-Tau species associated with human Tauopathies in the soluble form; and
      2) accumulated phospho-Tau in the insoluble fraction. The latter observation was 
      particularly evident with higher CIH intensities. This important and novel
      finding is consistent with the idea that sleep apnea and attendant CIH have the
      potential to accelerate the progression of Alzheimer's Disease and/or other
      Tauopathies.

TI  - Naringin prevents the reduction of the number of neurons and the volume of CA1 in
      a Scopolamine-Induced animal model of Alzheimer's disease (AD): A stereological
      study.
PG  - 1-12
LID - 10.1080/00207454.2022.2102981 [doi]
AB  - Despite several therapies, the effective treatment of Alzheimer's disease remains
      a global challenge. Hence, natural products might act as an alternative treatment
      for Alzheimer's disease. Naringin, a polyphenol, possesses promising potential in
      the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, we investigated the
      effect of naringin on scopolamine-induced inhibitory passive avoidance memory
      impairment, CA1 volume, and neuronal loss by using stereological methods.After
      the scopolamine intraperitoneal injection, rats were treated with naringin (50,
      100, and 200 mg/kg/day) for 14 consecutive days via intraperitoneal injection.
      The inhibitory passive avoidance test was performed for the memory test. 24 hours
      after the behavioral test; rats' brains were removed from the skull and fixed
      with 4% paraformaldehyde. The rats' brains cut and sections coronal, were stained
      using the cresyl violet staining for neurons. Finally, the changes in the neurons
      of the hippocampal CA1 area were examined stereologically.We observed that
      naringin ameliorated significantly inhibitory passive avoidance memory.
      Scopolamine decreased significantly the volume of the hippocampal CA1 area and
      naringin injection with doses of 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg, increased the volume of 
      the hippocampal CA1 area. Naringin administration at doses of 50, 100, and 200
      mg/kg for 14 consecutive days, increased neuron density and the total number of
      neurons in the hippocampal CA1 area.We concluded that naringin could be effective
      in improving scopolamine-induced inhibitory passive avoidance memory deficits and
      that it appeared to increase the volume and density as well as the total number
      of neurons in the CA1 area of the Alzheimer's rat hippocampus.

TI  - Two sides of the same coin? Revisiting the relationship between burden and
      positive aspects of caregiving in dementia.
LID - 10.1002/gps.5786 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Studies have shown that items on the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI)
      purported to measure self-criticism do not correlate well with the other items.
      Examination of item content suggests they may be measuring mixed sentiments-both 
      positive and negative-about caregiving. This study examined whether
      self-criticism is related to positive aspects of caregiving (PAC) in a way that
      is different from caregiver strain, and if so, which types of PAC.
      METHODS/DESIGN: The baseline data of two Alzheimer caregiver intervention studies
      were merged (N = 225). Based on previous factor analysis, 2 ZBI items formed the 
      self-criticism measure while 16 ZBI items measured global strain. PAC was
      assessed by coding caregivers' narratives about positive gains into seven themes 
      (relationship gains, growth, insights, competence/mastery, purpose, emotional
      rewards, and miscellaneous). RESULTS: Global strain was mildly associated with
      fewer total PAC, in a way consistent with the literature, and with less
      competence/mastery. However, self-criticism was associated with stronger
      relationship gains and purpose. Younger caregivers reported more relationship
      gains but less emotional rewards. Longer caregiving duration was associated with 
      more growth, but the reverse was true for chronic illnesses. Additionally,
      relationship closeness was associated with more emotional rewards, whereas
      care-recipient neuropsychiatric symptoms and functional impairment were
      associated with fewer relationship gains and emotional rewards respectively.
      CONCLUSION: Thinking one is not doing enough may indicate feelings of
      inadequacy/guilt but may also signal devotion to the relative and a sense of
      purpose in the caregiving role. Analyzing total burden and PAC scores may obscure
      the relationships between their components.

TI  - Potential eligibility for Aducanumab therapy in an Irish specialist cognitive
      service-Utilising cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers and appropriate use criteria.
LID - 10.1002/gps.5789 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Aducanumab is a monoclonal antibody which has recently been licenced 
      for use by the food and drug administration for treatment of patients with mild
      cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild AD dementia.
      Appropriate use criteria (AUC) for Aducanumab in clinical practice are available.
      We look to review patients in our specialist interdisciplinary cognitive service 
      with positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for AD for their hypothetical 
      eligibility for Aducanumab, or a similar anti-amyloid agent. METHODS:
      Retrospective analysis was undertaken of patients with positive AD-biomarker CSF 
      analysis. Data available at time of CSF analysis was reviewed to determine
      hypothetical eligibility for Aducanumab. RESULTS: Seventy patients had positive
      AD-CSF biomarkers. Forty nine of these were seen in the Gerontology-led service, 
      with 21 in the neurology cohort. Average patient age was 70 years old. Forty
      patients (57%) met eligibility criteria for Aducanumab therapy by AUC guidelines.
      CONCLUSION: We highlight the patients within our service who would be appropriate
      for Aducanumab or similar anti-amyloid agents should licencing be granted in the 
      European Union, and the need to develop the resources and capacity to deliver
      this or other emerging disease modifying AD therapies. CLINICAL TRIAL
      REGISTRATION: All patients in the combined cognitive clinic provide consent re
      willingness to be contacted re research.

AB  - Introduction: The aim of this study was to develop a conditional normative model 
      for Rey's Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) that accounts for practice
      effects. Methods: In our normative sample, robust conditional norms were derived 
      from 1001 cognitively unimpaired (CU) adults ages 50 to 89 who completed the AVLT
      up to eight times. Linear mixed-effects models adjusted for baseline performance,
      prior test exposures, time, demographics, and interaction terms. In our
      preliminary validation, mean performance on conditional and typical normative
      scores across two to four completed follow-up tests in preclinical Alzheimer's
      disease participants at baseline with positive amyloid and tau positron emission 
      (n = 27 CU amyloid [A]+tau[T]+) was compared to biomarker negative individuals (n
      = 269 CU A-T-). Results: AVLT performance using typical norms did not differ
      across A+T+ and A-T- groups. Conditional norms z-scores were lower in the A+T+
      relative to the A-T- group for 30-minute recall (P = .033) and sum of trials (P =
      .030). Discussion: Conditional normative methods that account for practice
      effects show promise for identifying longitudinal cognitive decline.

LID - 10.3389/fnagi.2022.894994 [doi]
AB  - The degu (Octodon degus) is a diurnal long-lived rodent that can spontaneously
      develop molecular and behavioral changes that mirror those seen in human aging.
      With age some degu, but not all individuals, develop cognitive decline and brain 
      pathology like that observed in Alzheimer's disease including neuroinflammation, 
      hyperphosphorylated tau and amyloid plaques, together with other co-morbidities
      associated with aging such as macular degeneration, cataracts, alterations in
      circadian rhythm, diabetes and atherosclerosis. Here we report the whole-genome
      sequencing and analysis of the degu genome, which revealed unique features and
      molecular adaptations consistent with aging and Alzheimer's disease. We
      identified single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes associated with Alzheimer's
      disease including a novel apolipoprotein E (Apoe) gene variant that correlated
      with an increase in amyloid plaques in brain and modified the in silico predicted
      degu APOE protein structure and functionality. The reported genome of an
      unconventional long-lived animal model of aging and Alzheimer's disease offers
      the opportunity for understanding molecular pathways involved in aging and should
      help advance biomedical research into treatments for Alzheimer's disease.

      Chemical Profile, Network Pharmacology, and UPLC-QTOF/MS-Based Metabolomics
      Analysis.

AB  - Background: Alzheimer's disease places a heavy economic burden to healthcare
      systems around the world. However, the effective treatments are still lacking.
      Traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) of Schisandra chinensis and Acorus
      tatarinowii Schott have the pharmacological effects of sedation and
      neuroprotection and have been clinically proven to be effective in the treatment 
      of AD. However, their main anti-Alzheimer's compounds and functional mechanisms
      remain unclear. Purpose: To elucidate the main therapeutic components and
      possible mechanisms of Sc-At in AD using a comprehensive strategy combining
      metabolomics and network pharmacology. Methods: First, the UPLC-QTOF/MS method
      was used to identify the main chemical constituents of Schisandra chinensis and
      Acorus tatarinowii Schott alcohol extracts in vitro and in vivo. Secondly, the
      theoretical active ingredients, targets, and pathways of Sc-At for AD treatment
      were predicted by network pharmacology methods. Finally, plasma metabolomics were
      detected by UPLC-QTOF/MS to analyze the differential metabolites and metabolic
      pathways related to Sc-At. Based on the analyses above, the anti-AD mechanism of 
      Sc-At was explored. Results: A total of 95 chemical components were identified in
      Sc-At extracts in vitro, and 34 prototype drug components were detected in rat
      plasma; network pharmacology screening identified 14 drug components in line with
      the principle of Lipinski, of which 10 were present for in vitro drug composition
      analysis. For these 10 components, 58 AD disease targets were predicted, and 85
      AD-related KEGG signaling pathways were enriched. Six core biomarkers of Sc-At
      (cis-8,11,14,17-eicosatetraenoic acid, prostaglandin H2, sphingosine 1-phosphate,
      enol-phenylpyruvate, 3-methoxytyrosine, and pristanoyl-CoA) were regulated to a
      normal state during the treatment of AD. Conclusion: The mechanism of Sc-At for
      the treatment of AD can be achieved by the effect of the 10 compounds of Sc-At on
      TNF, MAPK8, MAPK14, PTGS1, and other targets, thereby affecting arachidonic acid 
      metabolism, neurotransmitters, and sphingolipid metabolism.

AB  - Aluminum vessels are being used from a long time for various cooking purpose.
      Using cross-sectional study design, 90 participants, 30 in each category of
      normal, mild - moderate and severe Alzheimer's disease (AD), aged of 60 years and
      above were enrolled using SAGE scale. Data on the frequency of usage of aluminum 
      vessel for various types of cooking such as frying, baking, boiling,
      roasting/sauteing, and packing of food using aluminum foil were collected using
      the pretested semistructured questionnaire. Results showed that severity of AD
      was significantly associated (P < 0.05) with usage of aluminum utensils for
      various cooking purpose in all the three groups, with least total score for usage
      of aluminum vessels in normal category (3.2) and highest in severe category
      (18.67). Frying (P < 0.001), boiling (P < 0.05), and roasting/sauteing (P < 0.01)
      of foods in aluminum vessels was be significantly associated with the AD score.
      Degree of AD positively correlated with usage of aluminum vessels.

      neurodegeneration.
PG  - 628
LID - 10.1038/s41419-022-05058-3 [doi]
AB  - The advent of high-throughput single-cell transcriptomic analysis of microglia
      has revealed different phenotypes that are inherently associated with disease
      conditions. A common feature of some of these activated phenotypes is the
      upregulation of galectin-3. Representative examples of these phenotypes include
      disease-associated microglia (DAM) and white-associated microglia (WAM), whose
      role(s) in neuroprotection/neurotoxicity is a matter of high interest in the
      microglia community. In this review, we summarise the main findings that
      demonstrate the ability of galectin-3 to interact with key pattern recognition
      receptors, including, among others, TLR4 and TREM2 and the importance of
      galectin-3 in the regulation of microglia activation. Finally, we discuss
      increasing evidence supporting the involvement of this lectin in the main
      neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease,
      Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis,
      traumatic brain injury, and stroke.

LID - 10.1038/s41380-022-01685-6 [doi]
AB  - Amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition is common in cognitively unimpaired (CU) elderly 
      >85 years. This study investigated amyloid distribution and evaluated three
      published in vivo amyloid-PET staging schemes from a cognitively unimpaired (CU) 
      cohort aged 84.9 +/- 4.3 years (n = 75). SUV-based principal component analysis
      (PCA) was applied to (18)F-flutemetamol PET data to determine an unbiased
      regional covariance pattern of tracer uptake across grey matter regions. PET
      staging schemes were applied to the data and compared to the PCA output.
      Concentration of p-tau181 was measured in blood plasma. The PCA revealed three
      distinct components accounting for 91.2% of total SUV variance. PC1 driven by the
      large common variance of uptake in neocortical and striatal regions was
      significantly positively correlated with global SUVRs, APOE4 status and p-tau181 
      concentration. PC2 represented mainly non-specific uptake in typical amyloid-PET 
      reference regions, and PC3 the occipital lobe. Application of the staging schemes
      demonstrated that the majority of the CU cohort (up to 93%) were classified as
      having pathological amount and distribution of Abeta. Good correspondence existed
      between binary (+/-) classification and later amyloid stages, however,
      substantial differences existed between schemes for low stages with 8-17% of
      individuals being unstageable, i.e., not following the sequential progression of 
      Abeta deposition. In spite of the difference in staging outcomes there was broad 
      spatial overlap between earlier stages and PC1, most prominently in default mode 
      network regions. This study critically evaluated the utility of in vivo amyloid
      staging from a single PET scan in CU elderly and found that early amyloid stages 
      could not be consistently classified. The majority of the cohort had pathological
      Abeta, thus, it remains an open topic what constitutes abnormal brain Abeta in
      the oldest-old and what is the best method to determine that.

TI  - A clinicopathological study of selected cognitive impairment cases in Lothian,
      Scotland: enhanced CJD surveillance in the 65 + population group.
PG  - 603
LID - 10.1186/s12877-022-03280-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) is primarily associated with
      dietary exposure to bovine-spongiform-encephalopathy. Cases may be missed in the 
      elderly population where dementia is common with less frequent referral to
      specialist neurological services. This study's twin aims were to determine the
      feasibility of a method to detect possible missed cases in the elderly population
      and to identify any such cases. METHODS: A multi-site study was set-up in Lothian
      in 2016, to determine the feasibility of enhanced CJD-surveillance in the 65 +
      population-group, and undertake a clinicopathological investigation of patients
      with features of 'atypical' dementia. RESULTS: Thirty patients are included; 63% 
      male, 37% female. They were referred because of at least one neurological feature
      regarded as 'atypical' (for the common dementing illnesses): cerebellar ataxia,
      rapid progression, or somato-sensory features. Mean-age at symptom-onset (66
      years, range 53-82 years), the time between onset-of-symptoms and referral to the
      study (7 years, range 1-13 years), and duration-of-illness from onset-of-symptoms
      until death or the censor-date (9.5 years, range 1.1-17.4 years) were determined.
      By the censor-date, 9 cases were alive and 21 had died. Neuropathological
      investigations were performed on 10 cases, confirming: Alzheimer's disease only
      (2 cases), mixed Alzheimer's disease with Lewy bodies (2 cases), mixed
      Alzheimer's disease with amyloid angiopathy (1 case), moderate non-amyloid small 
      vessel angiopathy (1 case), a non-specific neurodegenerative disorder (1 case),
      Parkinson's disease with Lewy body dementia (1 case), and Lewy body dementia (2
      cases). No prion disease cases of any type were detected. CONCLUSION: The
      surveillance approach used was well received by the local clinicians and
      patients, though there were challenges in recruiting sufficient cases; far fewer 
      than expected were identified, referred, and recruited. Further research is
      required to determine how such difficulties might be overcome. No missed cases of
      vCJD were found. However, there remains uncertainty whether this is because
      missed cases are very uncommon or because the study had insufficient power to
      detect them.

TI  - Anesthesia promotes acute expression of genes related to Alzheimer's disease and 
      latent tau aggregation in transgenic mouse models of tauopathy.
PG  - 83
LID - 10.1186/s10020-022-00506-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Exposure to anesthesia in the elderly might increase the risk of
      dementia. Although the mechanism underlying the association is uncertain,
      anesthesia has been shown to induce acute tau hyperphosphorylation in preclinical
      models. We sought to investigate the impact of anesthesia on gene expression and 
      on acute and long-term changes in tau biochemistry in transgenic models of
      tauopathy in order to better understand how anesthesia influences the
      pathophysiology of dementia. METHODS: We exposed mice with over-expressed human
      mutant tau (P301L and hyperdopaminergic COMTKO/P301L) to two hours of isoflurane 
      and compared anesthetized mice to controls at several time points. We evaluated
      tau hyperphosphorylation with quantitative high-sensitivity enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay and performed differential expression and functional
      transcriptome analyses following bulk mRNA-sequencing. RESULTS: Anesthesia
      induced acute hyperphosphorylation of tau at epitopes related to Alzheimer's
      disease (AD) in both P301L-based models. Anesthesia was associated with
      differential expression of genes in the neurodegenerative pathways (e.g., AD-risk
      genes ApoE and Trem2) and thermogenesis pathway, which is related to both
      mammalian hibernation and tau phosphorylation. One and three months after
      anesthesia, hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates were increased in the anesthetized
      mice. CONCLUSIONS: Anesthesia may influence the expression of AD-risk genes and
      induce biochemical changes in tau that promote aggregation even after single
      exposure. Further preclinical and human studies are necessary to establish the
      relevance of our transcriptomic and biochemical findings in these preclinical
      models to the pathogenesis of dementia following anesthesia. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

      Adults.

LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000200675 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Lifestyle activities, such as physical activity and
      cognitive stimulation, may mitigate age-associated cognitive decline, delay
      dementia onset, and increase cognitive reserve. Whether the association between
      lifestyle activities and cognitive reserve differs by sex and APOE4 status is an 
      understudied yet critical component for informing targeted prevention strategies.
      The current study examined interactions between sex and physical or cognitive
      activities on cognitive reserve for speed and memory in older adults. METHODS:
      Research participants with unimpaired cognition, mild cognitive impairment, or
      dementia from the Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging Cohort were included
      in this study. Cognitive reserve scores for speed and memory were calculated by
      regressing out hippocampal volume, total gray matter volume, and white matter
      hyperintensity volume from composite cognitive scores for speed and memory,
      respectively. Self-reported physical activity was assessed using the Godin
      Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire, converted to metabolic equivalents (METS).
      Self-reported cognitive activity (COGACT) was calculated as the sum of three
      yes/no questions. Sex by activity interactions and sex-stratified analyses were
      conducted using multivariable linear regression models, including a secondary
      analysis with APOE4 as a moderating factor. RESULT: s: 758 participants (mean
      age=76.11+6.31 years, 62% women) were included in this study. Higher METS was
      associated with greater speed reserve in women (beta=0.04, CI: (0,0.08)), but not
      in men (beta=0.004, CI: (-0.04,0.05)). METS was not associated with memory
      reserve in women or men. More COGACT was associated with greater speed reserve in
      the cohort (beta=0.13, CI: (0.05,0.21)). More COGACT had a trend for greater
      memory reserve in women (beta=0.06, CI: (-0.02,0.14)), but not in men
      (beta=-0.04, CI: (-0.16,0.08)). Among women only, APOE4 carrier status attenuated
      relationships between METS and speed reserve (beta=-0.09, CI: (-0.22,0.04)), and 
      between COGACT and both speed (beta=-0.26, CI: (-0.63,0.11)) and memory reserves 
      (beta=-0.20, CI: (-0.50,0.093)). DISCUSSION: The associations of self-reported
      physical and cognitive activities with cognitive reserve are more pronounced in
      women, although APOE4 attenuates these associations. Future studies are needed to
      understand the causal relationship among sex, lifestyle activities, and genetic
      factors on cognitive reserve in older adults to best understand which lifestyle
      activities may be most beneficial and for whom.

AB  - Cognitive interventions (CI) are an important part in the treatment of
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). These non-pharamcological treatment options are
      manifold and can be matched to a patient's particular symptoms and needs. This
      article gives an overview of CIs and their theoretical background, as well as
      empirical evidence concerning their efficacy at different stages of the disease. 
      Specific determinants of their effectiveness and possible clinical applications
      are discussed, while also recent developments, such as computer-based CIs, are
      considered.

AB  - AIM: Dementia in Alzheimer s disease is a global challenge. There is growing
      evidence that investigating blood biomarkers to diagnose Alzheimer s disease is a
      promising fast, minimally invasive, and less costly method. The aim of this study
      was to review available studies on promising biomarkers for Alzheimer s disease. 
      METHOD: The latest studies were collated for this review. RESULTS: Immunoassays
      followed by mass spectrometry and immunomagnetic reduction were reported to be
      highly relevant methods for detecting amyloid-ss 42 (Ass42) and amyloid-ss 40
      (Ass40) to calculate the Ass42/Ass40 ratio, thereby improving the early diagnosis
      of Alzheimer s disease. Amyloid-ss (Ass) peptides in blood plasma were considered
      as potential markers, as they correlated with the brain's Ass pathology.
      Phosphorylated tau protein 181 (p-tau181), phosphorylated tau protein 217
      (p-tau217) and phosphorylated tau protein 231 (p-tau231) in blood samples
      assessed via Simoa technology served as parameters for the early and differential
      diagnosis of AD, and were markers of tau pathology in the brain. Neurofilament
      light chain (Nfl) and glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) were additional
      markers possibly facilitating the assessment of axonal and astroglial brain
      damage in Alzheimer s disease. GFAP in blood was useful as an additional marker
      to detect early and to predict the time course of Alzheimer s disease.
      CONCLUSIONS: Determining blood biomarkers represents less invasive and less
      costly diagnostics for Alzheimer s disease. The investigation of blood biomarkers
      such as the Ass42/Ass40 ratio, p-tau217, p-tau231, Nfl and GFAP have been
      promising in establishing the AT(N) classification for Alzheimer s disease.
      High-throughput methods should be evaluated in large patient cohort studies and
      via meta-analyses of studies. Consensus criteria with standard protocols for
      measuring these biomarkers while considering ethical issues and Alzheimer s
      phenotype should unify normative values from different laboratories. The AT(N)
      classification of Alzheimer s disease in blood would be a key element towards the
      implementation of minimally-invasive precision medicine.

AB  - Synapse loss and memory decline are the primary features of neurodegenerative
      dementia. However, the molecular underpinnings that drive memory loss remain
      largely unknown. Here, we report that FAM69C is a kinase critically involved in
      neurodegenerative dementia. Biochemical analyses uncover that FAM69C is a
      serine/threonine kinase. We generate the Fam69c knockout mice and show by
      single-cell RNA sequencing that FAM69C deficiency drives cell-type-specific
      transcriptional changes relevant to synapse dysfunction. Electrophysiological,
      morphological, and behavioral experiments demonstrate impairments in synaptic
      plasticity, dendritic spine density, and memory in Fam69c knockout mice, as well 
      as stress-induced neuronal death. Phosphoproteomic characterizations reveal that 
      FAM69C substrates are involved in synaptic structure and function. Finally,
      reduced levels of FAM69C are found in postmortem brains of Alzheimer's disease
      patients. Our study demonstrates that FAM69C is a protective regulator of memory 
      and suggests FAM69C as a potential therapeutic target for memory loss in
      neurodegenerative dementia.

AB  - Emerging evidence suggests that G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) kinases (GRKs) 
      are associated with the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However,
      GRKs have not been directly implicated in regulation of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) 
      pathogenic cascade in AD. Here, we determine that GRKs phosphorylate a
      non-canonical substrate, anterior pharynx-defective 1A (APH1A), an integral
      component of the gamma-secretase complex. Significantly, we show that GRKs
      generate distinct phosphorylation barcodes in intracellular loop 2 (ICL2) and the
      C terminus of APH1A, which differentially regulate recruitment of the scaffolding
      protein beta-arrestin 2 (betaarr2) to APH1A and gamma-secretase-mediated Abeta
      generation. Further molecular dynamics simulation studies reveal an interaction
      between the betaarr2 finger loop domain and ICL2 and ICL3 of APH1A, similar to a 
      GPCR-beta-arrestin complex, which regulates gamma-secretase activity.
      Collectively, these studies provide insight into the molecular and structural
      determinants of the APH1A-betaarr2 interaction that critically regulate Abeta
      generation.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD), as the fourth leading cause of death among the elderly 
      worldwide, has brought enormous challenge to the society. Due to its extremely
      complex pathogeneses, the development of multi-target directed ligands (MTDLs)
      becomes the major strategy for combating AD. Carbamate moiety, as an essential
      building block in the development of MTDLs, exhibits structural similarity to
      neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) and has piqued extensive attention in
      discovering multifunctional cholinesterase inhibitors. To date, numerous
      preclinical studies demonstrate that carbamate-based cholinesterase inhibitors
      can prominently increase the level of ACh and improve cognition impairments and
      behavioral deficits, providing a privileged strategy for the treatment of AD.
      Based on the recent research focus on the novel cholinesterase inhibitors with
      multiple biofunctions, this review aims at summarizing and discussing the most
      recent studies excavating the potential carbamate-based MTDLs with cholinesterase
      inhibition efficacy, to accelerate the pace of pleiotropic cholinesterase
      inhibitors for coping AD.

TI  - Targeted BACE-1 inhibition in microglia enhances amyloid clearance and improved
      cognitive performance.
PG  - eabo3610
LID - 10.1126/sciadv.abo3610 [doi]
AB  - Abnormal accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides is a culprit in
      Alzheimer's disease (AD); blocking Abeta generation is therefore being explored
      as a logical approach for AD treatment. Here, we demonstrate that targeted
      inhibition of beta-site amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleaving enzyme-1
      (BACE-1) in microglia has unique advantages. When Bace-1 was deleted in
      Alzheimer's 5xFAD microglia, fewer amyloid plaques developed, and this reduction 
      was not due to changes in APP processing but rather to enhanced Abeta clearance, 
      in line with the increase in a microglial gene signature favoring phagocytosis.
      Moreover, deletion of Bace-1 in microglia enhances functions of
      autophagolysosomes and Abeta-induced metabolic reprogramming necessary for Abeta 
      degradation by favoring phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 
      (mTOR) at Ser(2448) and modulating the PI3K-mTOR-HIF-1alpha signaling pathways.
      Mice with deletion of Bace-1 in microglia showed no reduction in long-term
      potentiation, unlike global deletion of Bace-1. Our results suggest that targeted
      inhibition of BACE-1 in microglia is a superior strategy for AD treatment.

TI  - Alzheimer's disease: Ablating single master site abolishes tau
      hyperphosphorylation.
PG  - eabl8809
LID - 10.1126/sciadv.abl8809 [doi]
AB  - Hyperphosphorylation of the neuronal tau protein is a hallmark of
      neurodegenerative tauopathies such as Alzheimer's disease. A central unanswered
      question is why tau becomes progressively hyperphosphorylated. Here, we show that
      tau phosphorylation is governed by interdependence- a mechanistic link between
      initial site-specific and subsequent multi-site phosphorylation. Systematic
      assessment of site interdependence identified distinct residues (threonine-50,
      threonine-69, and threonine-181) as master sites that determine propagation of
      phosphorylation at multiple epitopes. CRISPR point mutation and expression of
      human tau in Alzheimer's mice showed that site interdependence governs
      physiologic and amyloid-associated multi-site phosphorylation and cognitive
      deficits, respectively. Combined targeting of master sites and p38alpha, the most
      central tau kinase linked to interdependence, synergistically ablated
      hyperphosphorylation. In summary, our work delineates how complex tau
      phosphorylation arises to inform therapeutic and biomarker design for
      tauopathies.

TI  - The Development of Videoconference-Based Support for People Living With Rare
      Dementias and Their Carers: Protocol for a 3-Phase Support Group Evaluation.
PG  - e35376
LID - 10.2196/35376 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: People living with rarer dementias face considerable difficulty
      accessing tailored information, advice, and peer and professional support.
      Web-based meeting platforms offer a critical opportunity to connect with others
      through shared lived experiences, even if they are geographically dispersed,
      particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: We aim to develop
      facilitated videoconferencing support groups (VSGs) tailored to people living
      with or caring for someone with familial or sporadic frontotemporal dementia or
      young-onset Alzheimer disease, primary progressive aphasia, posterior cortical
      atrophy, or Lewy body dementia. This paper describes the development,
      coproduction, field testing, and evaluation plan for these groups. METHODS: We
      describe a 3-phase approach to development. First, information and knowledge were
      gathered as part of a coproduction process with members of the Rare Dementia
      Support service. This information, together with literature searches and
      consultation with experts by experience, clinicians, and academics, shaped the
      design of the VSGs and session themes. Second, field testing involved 154 Rare
      Dementia Support members (people living with dementia and carers) participating
      in 2 rounds of facilitated sessions across 7 themes (health and social care
      professionals, advance care planning, independence and identity, grief and loss, 
      empowering your identity, couples, and hope and dementia). Third, a detailed
      evaluation plan for future rounds of VSGs was developed. RESULTS: The development
      of the small groups program yielded content and structure for 9 themed VSGs (the 
      7 piloted themes plus a later stages program and creativity club for
      implementation in rounds 3 and beyond) to be delivered over 4 to 8 sessions. The 
      evaluation plan incorporated a range of quantitative (attendance, demographics,
      and geography; pre-post well-being ratings and surveys; psycholinguistic analysis
      of conversation; facial emotion recognition; facilitator ratings; and economic
      analysis of program delivery) and qualitative (content and thematic analysis)
      approaches. Pilot data from round 2 groups on the pre-post 3-word surveys
      indicated an increase in the emotional valence of words selected after the
      sessions. CONCLUSIONS: The involvement of people with lived experience of a rare 
      dementia was critical to the design, development, and delivery of the small
      virtual support group program, and evaluation of this program will yield
      convergent data about the impact of tailored support delivered to geographically 
      dispersed communities. This is the first study to design and plan an evaluation
      of VSGs specifically for people affected by rare dementias, including both people
      living with a rare dementia and their carers, and the outcome of the evaluation
      will be hugely beneficial in shaping specific and targeted support, which is
      often lacking in this population. INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER

TI  - Assessment of Current Practices Across Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers
      Biorepositories.
LID - 10.1089/bio.2022.0022 [doi]
AB  - In 1984, the National Institute on Aging developed the Alzheimer's disease
      centers program. The main goal of these centers is to advance the understanding
      of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) through comprehensive patient
      evaluations and cutting-edge research in pathology, laboratory medicine,
      education, and scientific discovery. The neuropathology core of the Alzheimer's
      Disease Research Centers (ADRCs) collects postmortem brain tissue from consented 
      donors ranging from cognitively normal individuals to those with late-stage
      dementia, whose samples and data can be shared around the world to further
      advance knowledge, diagnosis, and to eventually find cures for ADRD. Although
      recommended guidelines for biorepositories exist, we aimed to understand the
      current practices within neuropathology cores across the ADRCs. A survey was
      developed that focused on information related to sample processing methods,
      biospecimen requests, financial costs related to the repository, and data
      management. This survey was distributed to 28 current and former ADRC
      neuropathology cores. The survey obtained a response rate of 82% (23/28).
      Although most centers were consistent in responses related to sample processing
      and storage, they varied widely in processes by which neuropathological samples
      are shared and cost recovery mechanisms. The results of this survey provide
      benchmark data on practices within neuropathology cores across ADRCs and the
      overlap with biorepository best practices. Future studies focused on
      understanding factors that may influence current practices (such as available
      funds and personnel) are need to aid in minimizing barriers to optimally follow
      best practices. Sharing these data among ADRCs will allow for improvement in
      workflows and working toward cures for ADRD.

TI  - Multi-method investigation of factors influencing amyloid onset and impairment in
      three cohorts.
LID - awac213 [pii]

AB  - Alzheimer's disease biomarkers are becoming increasingly important for
      characterizing the longitudinal course of disease, predicting the timing of
      clinical and cognitive symptoms, and for recruitment and treatment monitoring in 
      clinical trials. In this work, we develop and evaluate three methods for
      modelling the longitudinal course of amyloid accumulation in three cohorts using 
      amyloid PET imaging. We then use these novel approaches to investigate factors
      that influence the timing of amyloid onset and the timing from amyloid onset to
      impairment onset in the Alzheimer's disease continuum. Data were acquired from
      the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), the Baltimore
      Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) and the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's
      Prevention (WRAP). Amyloid PET was used to assess global amyloid burden. Three
      methods were evaluated for modelling amyloid accumulation using 10-fold
      cross-validation and holdout validation where applicable. Estimated amyloid onset
      age was compared across all three modelling methods and cohorts. Cox regression
      and accelerated failure time models were used to investigate whether sex,
      apolipoprotein E genotype and e4 carriage were associated with amyloid onset age 
      in all cohorts. Cox regression was used to investigate whether apolipoprotein E
      (e4 carriage and e3e3, e3e4, e4e4 genotypes), sex or age of amyloid onset were
      associated with the time from amyloid onset to impairment onset (global clinical 
      dementia rating >/=1) in a subset of 595 ADNI participants that were not impaired
      before amyloid onset. Model prediction and estimated amyloid onset age were
      similar across all three amyloid modelling methods. Sex and apolipoprotein E e4
      carriage were not associated with PET-measured amyloid accumulation rates.
      Apolipoprotein E genotype and e4 carriage, but not sex, were associated with
      amyloid onset age such that e4 carriers became amyloid positive at an earlier age
      compared to non-carriers, and greater e4 dosage was associated with an earlier
      amyloid onset age. In the ADNI, e4 carriage, being female and a later amyloid
      onset age were all associated with a shorter time from amyloid onset to
      impairment onset. The risk of impairment onset due to age of amyloid onset was
      non-linear and accelerated for amyloid onset age >65. These findings demonstrate 
      the feasibility of modelling longitudinal amyloid accumulation to enable
      individualized estimates of amyloid onset age from amyloid PET imaging. These
      estimates provide a more direct way to investigate the role of amyloid and other 
      factors that influence the timing of clinical impairment in Alzheimer's disease.

TI  - Total and regional fat-to-muscle mass ratio and risks of incident all-cause
      dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and vascular dementia.
LID - 10.1002/jcsm.13054 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The fat-to-muscle mass ratio (FMR), which integrates the antagonistic
      effects of fat and muscle mass, has been proposed as a useful indicator to assess
      disease risk independent of overall obesity. However, little is known about the
      association between FMR and dementia risk. We aimed to prospectively investigate 
      the sex-specific associations between total and regional FMR and incident
      dementia. METHODS: A total of 491 420 participants (223 581 men and 267 839
      women; mean age 56.7 +/- 8.2 and 56.3 +/- 8.0 years old, respectively) free of
      dementia at baseline from the UK Biobank were included. Fat mass and muscle mass 
      were measured using a bioelectrical impedance assessment device. Cox regression
      analyses were used to examine the associations of total and regional FMR with
      incident all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VD).
      The shape of the associations of the continuous scale of FMR and incident
      dementia were examined using restricted cubic spline analysis. RESULTS: During a 
      median 8.65 years of follow-up, we documented 2 225 incident all-cause dementia
      cases, including 836 AD and 468 VD cases. There was an L-shaped association
      between whole body FMR and all-cause dementia risk in both sexes after adjusting 
      body mass index (BMI) and other covariates (P for non-linear <0.001 in men and
      women), where all-cause dementia risk decreased steeply with increasing FMR and
      levelled off at around the medians (0.35 in men, 0.61 in women) with a hazard
      ratio (HR) of 0.78 (95% CI: 0.64, 0.96; P = 0.019) and 0.60 (0.47, 0.77; <0.001) 
      per 1 standard deviation (SD) increase in men and women, respectively. Compared
      with other body parts, FMR of the leg showed the strongest inverse associations
      [HR (95% CI; P) per 1 SD below the medians: 0.60 (0.48, 0.75; <0.001); 0.61
      (0.47, 0.79; <0.001) in men and women, respectively]. Specifically, the inverse
      associations of whole body FMR on all-cause dementia risk were significant only
      among participants over the age of 60 (P for trend <0.001). Multivariable
      adjusted Cox models showed inverse associations of whole body FMR with AD in men 
      only (P for trend = 0.003), whereas no statistically significant decrease was
      detected in VD among men and women. CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses provide strong
      evidence for L-shaped associations of total and regional FMR with the development
      of dementia among participants aged 60 years or older independent of overall
      obesity.

AB  - Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are important metabolites derived from the gut
      microbiota through fermentation of dietary fiber. SCFAs participate a number of
      physiological and pathological processes in the human body, such as host
      metabolism, immune regulation, appetite regulation. Recent studies on gut-brain
      interaction have shown that SCFAs are important mediators of gut-brain
      interactions and are involved in the occurrence and development of many
      neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. This review summarizes
      the current research on the potential roles and mechanisms of SCFAs in AD. First,
      we introduce the metabolic distribution, specific receptors and signaling
      pathways of SCFAs in human body. The concentration levels of SCFAs in AD
      patient/animal models are then summarized. In addition, we illustrate the effects
      and mechanisms of SCFAs on the cognitive level, pathological features (Abeta and 
      tau) and neuroinflammation in AD. Finally, we analyze the translational value of 
      SCFAs as potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of AD.

      prognosis and disease management. It can also support the testing of new
      prevention and treatment strategies through clinical trials. In this study, we
      employed spectral clustering to cluster 29,922 AD patients in the OneFlorida Data
      Trust using their longitudinal EHR data of diagnosis and conditions into four
      subtypes. These subtypes exhibit different patterns of progression of other
      conditions prior to the first AD diagnosis. In addition, according to the results
      of various statistical tests, these subtypes are also significantly different
      with respect to demographics, mortality, and prescription medications after the
      AD diagnosis. This study could potentially facilitate early detection and
      personalized treatment of AD as well as data-driven generalizability assessment
      of clinical trials for AD.

TI  - "Please Advise": Understanding the Needs of Informal Caregivers of People with
      Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia from Online Communities Through a
      Structured Topic Modeling Approach.
PG  - 149-158
AB  - The informal or family caregivers of the Alzheimer's disease or related dementia 
      (ADRD) patients, also known as the "invisible second patients", are often
      reported experiencing emotional and behavioral hardships. In recent years, the
      rapid development of online communities provides these caregivers a new
      opportunity for seeking information and emotional support. Comparing with offline
      social support services which have been constrained during the COVID-19 pandemic,
      online support allows caregivers to reach many peers in a convenient manner. This
      research aimed to examine the issues faced by ADRD caregivers through performing 
      a structural topic modeling on posts from two online communities. Results
      revealed that the top concerns of the caregivers include getting along with
      Alzheimer's patients, family issues, patients' internal medical issues, stages of
      the disease, care facilities, etc. The results may have a further implication to 
      the future implementation of psychological and social intervention of ADRD family
      care.

TI  - Prodromal characteristics of dementia with Lewy bodies: baseline results of the
      MEMENTO memory clinics nationwide cohort.
PG  - 96
LID - 10.1186/s13195-022-01037-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Isolated subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) and mild cognitive
      impairment (MCI) are the prodromal phases of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).
      MEMENTO is a nationwide study of patients with SCI and MCI with clinic,
      neuropsychology, biology, and brain imaging data. We aimed to compare SCI and MCI
      patients with symptoms of prodromal DLB to others in this study at baseline.
      METHODS: Participants of the French MEMENTO cohort study were recruited for
      either SCI or MCI. Among them, 892 were included in the Lewy sub-study, designed 
      to search specifically for symptoms of DLB. Probable prodromal DLB diagnosis
      (pro-DLB group) was done using a two-criteria cutoff score among the four core
      clinical features of DLB. This Pro-DLB group was compared to two other groups at 
      baseline: one without any core symptoms (NS group) and the one with one core
      symptom (1S group). A comprehensive cognitive battery, questionnaires on
      behavior, neurovegetative and neurosensory symptoms, brain 3D volumetric MRI,
      CSF, FDG PET, and amyloid PET were done. RESULTS: The pro-DLB group comprised 148
      patients (16.6%). This group showed more multidomain (59.8%) MCI with slower
      processing speed and a higher proportion of patients with depression, anxiety,
      apathy, constipation, rhinorrhea, sicca syndrome, and photophobia, compared to
      the NS group. The pro-DLB group had isolated lower P-Tau in the CSF (not
      significant after adjustments for confounders) and on brain MRI widening of sulci
      including fronto-insular, occipital, and olfactory sulci (FDR corrected), when
      compared to the NS group. Evolution to dementia was not different between the
      three groups over a median follow-up of 2.6 years. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with
      symptoms of prodromal DLB are cognitively slower, with more behavioral disorders,
      autonomic symptoms, and photophobia. The occipital, fronto-insular, and olfactory
      bulb involvement on brain MRI was consistent with symptoms and known
      neuropathology. The next step will be to study the clinical, biological, and
      imaging evolution of these patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov ,

LID - 10.1038/s41467-022-30653-5 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the brain accumulation of
      amyloid-beta and tau proteins. A growing body of literature suggests that
      epigenetic dysregulations play a role in the interplay of hallmark
      proteinopathies with neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. Here, we aim to 
      characterize an epigenetic dysregulation associated with the brain deposition of 
      amyloid-beta and tau proteins. Using positron emission tomography (PET) tracers
      selective for amyloid-beta, tau, and class I histone deacetylase (HDAC I isoforms
      1-3), we find that HDAC I levels are reduced in patients with AD. HDAC I PET
      reduction is associated with elevated amyloid-beta PET and tau PET
      concentrations. Notably, HDAC I reduction mediates the deleterious effects of
      amyloid-beta and tau on brain atrophy and cognitive impairment. HDAC I PET
      reduction is associated with 2-year longitudinal neurodegeneration and cognitive 
      decline. We also find HDAC I reduction in the postmortem brain tissue of patients
      with AD and in a transgenic rat model expressing human amyloid-beta plus tau
      pathology in the same brain regions identified in vivo using PET. These
      observations highlight HDAC I reduction as an element associated with AD
      pathophysiology.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease has been considered mostly as a neuronal pathology, although 
      increasing evidence suggests that glial cells might play a key role in the
      disease onset and progression. In this sense, astrocytes, with their central role
      in neuronal metabolism and function, are of great interest for increasing our
      understanding of the disease. Thus, exploring the morphological and functional
      changes suffered by astrocytes along the course of this disorder has great
      therapeutic and diagnostic potential. In this work we isolated and cultivated
      astrocytes from symptomatic 9-10-months-old adult 3xTg-AD mice, with the aim of
      characterizing their phenotype and exploring their pathogenic potential. These
      "old" astrocytes occurring in the 3xTg-AD mouse model of Alzheimer's Disease
      presented high proliferation rate and differential expression of astrocytic
      markers compared with controls. They were neurotoxic to primary neuronal cultures
      both, in neuronal-astrocyte co-cultures and when their conditioned media (ACM)
      was added into neuronal cultures. ACM caused neuronal GSK3beta activation,
      changes in cytochrome c pattern, and increased caspase 3 activity, suggesting
      intrinsic apoptotic pathway activation. Exposure of neurons to ACM caused
      different subcellular responses. ACM application to the somato-dendritic domain
      in compartmentalised microfluidic chambers caused degeneration both locally in
      soma/dendrites and distally in axons. However, exposure of axons to ACM did not
      affect somato-dendritic nor axonal integrity. We propose that this newly
      described old 3xTg-AD neurotoxic astrocytic population can contribute towards the
      mechanistic understanding of the disease and shed light on new therapeutical
      opportunities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In daily practice, sleep apnea is underdiagnosed in people with Down 
      syndrome. The WatchPAT can detect sleep apnea in a less invasive way. AIM: This
      study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of the WatchPAT to detect sleep apnea in 
      individuals with Down syndrome. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Thirty-one participants
      with Down syndrome (aged 18+) were included. Sleep apnea was detected with the
      WatchPAT and compared to results of the STOP-Bang Questionnaire (current
      practice). Experiences of participants, caregivers and clinicians were studied
      using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. OUTCOMES AND
      RESULTS: Among the 68% of participants who accepted the WatchPAT, sleep apnea was
      detected in 95% of participants. Younger participants and participants with
      mild/moderate intellectual disabilities were more likely to accept the device.
      STOP-Bang did not detect most cases of sleep apnea. For the degree of sleep
      apnea, interrater reliability was substantial (k = 0.71) to almost perfect (k =
      0.91). Considering experiences, caregivers and clinicians were predominantly
      positive about the WatchPAT. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that the WatchPAT is a
      promising device to detect sleep apnea in people with Down syndrome. Compared to 
      polysomnography, detection with this device is less invasive and less burdensome 
      for people with Down syndrome. Furthermore, the WatchPAT is a relatively
      accessible solution to implement in care institutions.

      pathway (ECSIT) in pathophysiology.
LID - 10.1002/jcp.30832 [doi]
AB  - The evolutionarily conserved signaling intermediate in toll pathway (ECSIT) is a 
      cytosolic adaptor protein associated with the toll-like receptor pathway. It has 
      a distinct N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence, pentatricopeptide repeat 
      motif, and a C-terminal pleckstrin homology domain. ECSIT regulates many
      biological processes like embryonic development, inflammation, cardiac function, 
      and assembly of mitochondrial complex I. Besides, ECSIT also interacts with
      multiple signaling intermediates like tumor necrosis receptor associated factor 6
      and retinoic acid inducible gene 1 as well as regulates various pathways in the
      microcellular environment. However, molecular details of ECSIT functions in
      pathophysiology remain elusive. This review summarizes the diverse functions of
      ECSIT and its involvement in pathophysiological conditions such as Alzheimer's,
      oxidative stress, and infection.

TI  - Amyloid-beta misfolding and GFAP predict risk of clinical Alzheimer's disease
      diagnosis within 17 years.
LID - 10.1002/alz.12745 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are urgently
      needed. Here, four plasma biomarkers were measured at baseline in a
      community-based cohort followed over 17 years, and the association with clinical 
      AD risk was determined. METHODS: Amyloid beta (Abeta) misfolding status as a
      structure-based biomarker as well as phosphorylated tau 181 (P-tau181), glial
      fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light (NfL) concentration
      levels were determined at baseline in heparin plasma from 68 participants who
      were diagnosed with AD and 240 controls without dementia diagnosis throughout
      follow-up. RESULTS: Abeta misfolding exhibited high disease prediction accuracy
      of AD diagnosis within 17 years. Among the concentration markers, GFAP showed the
      best performance, followed by NfL and P-tau181. The combination of Abeta
      misfolding and GFAP increased the accuracy. DISCUSSION: Abeta misfolding and GFAP
      showed a strong ability to predict clinical AD risk and may be important early AD
      risk markers. Abeta misfolding illustrated its potential as a prescreening tool
      for AD risk stratification in older adults.

TI  - Activation of the hypoxia response protects mice from amyloid-beta accumulation.
PG  - 432
LID - 10.1007/s00018-022-04460-6 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia with limited
      treatment options affecting millions of people and the prevalence increasing with
      the aging population. The current knowledge on the role of the
      hypoxia/hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) in the AD pathology is restricted and
      controversial. We hypothesized based on benefits of the genetic long-term
      inactivation of HIF prolyl 4-hydroxylase-2 (HIF-P4H-2) on metabolism, vasculature
      and inflammatory response that prolonged moderate activation of the hypoxia
      response could hinder AD pathology. We used an aging model to study potential
      spontaneous accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in HIF-P4H-2-deficient mice and 
      a transgenic APP/PSEN1 mouse model subjected to prolonged sustained environmental
      hypoxia (15% O2 for 6 weeks) at two different time points of the disease; at age 
      of 4 and 10 months. In both settings, activation of the hypoxia response reduced 
      brain protein aggregate levels and this associated with higher vascularity. In
      the senescent HIF-P4H-2-deficient mice metabolic reprogramming also contributed
      to less protein aggregates while in APP/PSEN1 mice lesser Abeta associated
      additionally with hypoxia-mediated favorable responses to neuroinflammation and
      amyloid precursor protein processing. In conclusion, continuous, non-full-scale
      activation of the HIF pathway appears to mediate protection against
      neurodegeneration via several mechanisms and should be studied as a treatment
      option for AD.

TI  - Increased surface P2X4 receptors by mutant SOD1 proteins contribute to ALS
      pathogenesis in SOD1-G93A mice.
PG  - 431
LID - 10.1007/s00018-022-04461-5 [doi]
AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal motoneuron (MN) disease
      characterized by protein misfolding and aggregation leading to cellular
      degeneration. So far neither biomarker, nor effective treatment has been found.
      ATP signaling and P2X4 receptors (P2X4) are upregulated in various
      neurodegenerative diseases. Here we show that several ALS-related misfolded
      proteins including mutants of SOD1 or TDP-43 lead to a significant increase in
      surface P2X4 receptor density and function in vitro. In addition, we demonstrate 
      in the spinal the cord of SOD1-G93A (SOD1) mice that misfolded SOD1-G93A proteins
      directly interact with endocytic adaptor protein-2 (AP2); thus, acting as
      negative competitors for the interaction between AP2 and P2X4, impairing
      constitutive P2X4 endocytosis. The higher P2X4 surface density was particularly
      observed in peripheral macrophages of SOD1 mice before the onset and during the
      progression of ALS symptoms positioning P2X4 as a potential early biomarker for
      ALS. P2X4 expression was also upregulated in spinal microglia of SOD1 mice during
      ALS and affect microglial inflammatory responses. Importantly, we report using
      double transgenic SOD1 mice expressing internalization-defective P2X4mCherryIN
      knock-in gene or invalidated for the P2X4 gene that P2X4 is instrumental for
      motor symptoms, ALS progression and survival. This study highlights the role of
      P2X4 in the pathophysiology of ALS and thus its potential for the development of 
      biomarkers and treatments. We also decipher the molecular mechanism by which
      misfolded proteins related to ALS impact P2X4 trafficking at early pathological
      stage in cells expressing-P2X4.

TI  - Rural health disparities in health care utilization for dementia in Minnesota.
LID - 10.1111/jrh.12700 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We visualized rural-urban differences in inpatient hospitalization and
      emergency department (ED) health care utilization (HCU) for older adults with
      dementia to understand the HCU of rural versus urban older adults in Minnesota
      and to examine in greater detail the variability of HCU in rural areas. METHODS: 
      For 3 older adult age groups, we utilized Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project
      (H-CUP) datasets from 2016 to 2018 to profile hospital admission rates, and ED
      visit rates related to dementia stratified by rurality and regions. Rates were
      visualized by spatial interpolation method. We then used logistic regression
      analysis adjusted by multiple covariates to evaluate rural-urban differences of
      the chance of having a dementia diagnosis in HCU. FINDINGS: Minnesota rural areas
      showed 17.6% lower age-adjusted rate (AAR) of dementia mortality than urban
      areas. AARs of ED visits for dementia were 12.4% higher in rural ZIP codes,
      whereas AARs of hospitalization were 24.7% lower. After controlling for
      neighborhood-level risk factors, such as income, education, health behaviors, and
      provider access, the odds ratios of having dementia diagnosis are 12% lower if an
      ED visit patient lives in rural as opposed to an urban area (OR = 0.88, P<.0001).
      CONCLUSIONS: In comparison to AAR, the fully adjusted data showed larger
      rural-urban predictors of having dementia diagnoses in hospitalizations and ED
      utilizations and demonstrated differences between AAR of ED visit and odds ratios
      of having dementia diagnosis. A regional comparison revealed that dementia ED
      visits were higher for Northeast MN compared to Minnesota's largest metropolitan 
      region.

TI  - Exploring links between 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenases and Alzheimer's
      disease.
LID - 10.1002/alz.12733 [doi]
AB  - Hypoxia, that is, an inadequate oxygen supply, is linked to neurodegeneration and
      patients with cardiovascular disease are prone to Alzheimer's disease (AD).
      2-Oxoglutarate and ferrous iron-dependent oxygenases (2OGDD) play a key role in
      the regulation of oxygen homeostasis by acting as hypoxia sensors. 2OGDD also
      have roles in collagen biosynthesis, lipid metabolism, nucleic acid repair, and
      the regulation of transcription and translation. Many biological processes in
      which the >60 human 2OGDD are involved are altered in AD patient brains, raising 
      the question as to whether 2OGDD are involved in the transition from normal aging
      to AD. Here we give an overview of human 2OGDD and critically discuss their
      potential roles in AD, highlighting possible relationships with synapse
      dysfunction/loss. 2OGDD may regulate neuronal/glial differentiation through
      enzyme activity-dependent mechanisms and modulation of their activity has
      potential to protect against synapse loss. Work linking 2OGDD and AD is at an
      early stage, especially from a therapeutic perspective; we suggest integrated
      pathology and in vitro discovery research to explore their roles in AD is
      merited. We hope to help enable long-term research on the roles of 2OGDD and,
      more generally, oxygen/hypoxia in AD. We also suggest shorter term empirically
      guided clinical studies concerning the exploration of 2OGDD/oxygen modulators to 
      help maintain synaptic viability are of interest for AD treatment.

TI  - The promise of music therapy for Alzheimer's disease: A review.
LID - 10.1111/nyas.14864 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease associated
      with cognitive decline. Memory problems are typically among the first signs of
      cognitive impairment in AD, and they worsen considerably as the disease
      progresses. However, musical memory is partially spared in patients with AD,
      despite severe deficits in episodic (and partly semantic) memory. AD patients can
      learn new songs, encode novel verbal information, and react emotionally to music.
      These effects of music have encouraged the use and development of music therapy
      (MT) for AD management. MT is easy to implement and well-tolerated by most
      patients and their caregivers. Effects of MT in patients with AD include improved
      mood, reduced depressive scores and trait anxiety, enhanced autobiographical
      recall, verbal fluency, and cognition. Here, we review musical memory in AD,
      therapeutic effects of studies using MT on AD, and potential mechanisms
      underlying those therapeutic effects. We argue that, because AD begins decades
      before the presentation of clinical symptoms, music interventions might be a
      promising means to delay and decelerate the neurodegeneration in individuals at
      risk for AD, such as individuals with genetic risk or subjective cognitive
      decline.

AB  - Global warming is a serious public health threat to people worldwide. High body
      temperature is one of the important risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD),
      and the body temperature of AD patients has been found to be significantly higher
      than that of elderly control subjects. However, the effects of high body
      temperature on cognitive function and AD pathologies have not been completely
      elucidated. We report here that Tg2576 mice housed at a high ambient temperature 
      of 30 degrees C for 13 months showed an increase in the body temperature, which
      is accompanied by memory impairment and an enhancement of amyloid-beta peptides
      (Abeta) generation through the upregulation of beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1
      (BACE1) level and decrease in the level of an Abeta-degrading enzyme, neprilysin 
      (NEP) in the brain, compared with those of Tg2576 mice at 23 degrees C. High body
      temperature also increased the levels of heat shock proteins (HSPs),
      stress-stimulated kinases such as JNK, and total tau, leading to the enhancement 
      of tau phosphorylation at 30 degrees C. Taken together, our findings suggest that
      high body temperature exacerbates cognitive function and AD pathologies, which
      provides a mechanistic insight for its prevention.

AB  - Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) may hold therapeutic benefits for
      people with Alzheimer's disease (AD). SSRIs may perturb AD progression, or the
      conversion from MCI to AD, via increased neurogenesis, reduced oxidative stress
      and/or favourable Amyloid-beta Precursor Protein (AbetaPP) processing. This study
      used iPSC derived cortical neuronal cells carrying 3 different PSEN1 mutations,
      to investigate the effect of treatment with the SSRI, Citalopram on AbetaPP
      processing and oxidative stress. Control and PSEN1 mutation (L286V, A246E, M146L)
      iPSC-derived neurons were treated with Citalopram for 45 days. ADAM10 activity,
      AbetaPP processing and Abeta generation was measured in addition to cellular
      redox status. Citalopram treatment reduced the Abeta1-42:40 ratio in control but 
      not in fAD PSEN1 cells. ADAM10 activity was increased with Citalopram treatments 
      in fAD PSEN1 cell lines, which was also seen for sAbetaPPalpha secretion. Lower
      superoxide generation in fAD PSEN1 cells following Citalopram treatment was
      identified, although there was no effect on end markers of oxidative stress.
      Treatment with Citalopram appears to have little effect on Abeta generation in
      fADPSEN1 cells, but our findings suggest that treatment can significantly
      increase non-amyloidogenic AbetaPP processing and reduce oxidative stress. These 
      changes may explain why SSRIs appear most effective in the prodromal period of
      the disease progression, as opposed to reducing established AD pathology. Further
      investigation of specific pathways conferring the beneficial effects of SSRIs
      treatment are warranted.

AB  - Consistent with the concept of the gut-brain phenomenon, observational studies
      suggest a relationship between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and gastrointestinal
      tract (GIT) disorders; however, their underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here,
      we analyse several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics (N =
      34,652-456,327), to assess the relationship of AD with GIT disorders. Findings
      reveal a positive significant genetic overlap and correlation between AD and
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcer disease (PUD),
      gastritis-duodenitis, irritable bowel syndrome and diverticulosis, but not
      inflammatory bowel disease. Cross-trait meta-analysis identifies several loci
      (Pmeta-analysis < 5 x 10(-8)) shared by AD and GIT disorders (GERD and PUD)
      including PDE4B, BRINP3, ATG16L1, SEMA3F, HLA-DRA, SCARA3, MTSS2, PHB, and
      TOMM40. Colocalization and gene-based analyses reinforce these loci.
      Pathway-based analyses demonstrate significant enrichment of lipid metabolism,
      autoimmunity, lipase inhibitors, PD-1 signalling, and statin mechanisms, among
      others, for AD and GIT traits. Our findings provide genetic insights into the
      gut-brain relationship, implicating shared but non-causal genetic susceptibility 
      of GIT disorders with AD's risk. Genes and biological pathways identified are
      potential targets for further investigation in AD, GIT disorders, and their
      comorbidity.

AB  - This study aimed to explore the action targets and mechanisms of Polygala
      tenuifolia and Acorus tatarinowii in treating Alzheimer's disease(AD) based on
      network pharmacology, molecular docking, and animal tests. The AD-related targets
      were collec-ted from GeneCard and the main active ingredients and targets of P.
      tenuifolia and A. tatarinowii from the TCMSP. Cytoscape was applied to construct 
      the &quot;Chinese herb-active ingredient-target-disease&quot; network, followed
      by the construction of protein-protein interaction(PPI) network using STRING. GO 
      biological function and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis was performed by DAVID
      and Metascape. The main active components of P. tenuifolia and A. tatarinowii and
      their potential core targets were docking using AutoDock Vina. The effects of P. 
      tenuifolia and A. tatarinowii on the cognitive function were verified in mice
      with scopolamine(SCOP)-induced cognitive impairment. A total of seven active
      ingredients including kaempferol, onjixanthone , and marmesin and 56 potential
      targets of P. tenuifolia and A. tatarinowii were screened out, with the core
      targets covering AKT1, PTGS2, TNF, and NF-kappaB inflammation pathway mainly
      involved. The results of molecular docking also showed that the main active
      components of P. tenuifolia and A. tatarinowii stably bond to the core targets
      predicted by network pharmacology. The new object recognition experiment
      suggested that P. tenuifolia and A. tatarinowii improved the learning and memory 
      abilities of mice after SCOP induction. As revealed by pathological section
      observation and relevant kit assay, P. tenuifolia and A. tatarinowii reduced the 
      damage of central cholinergic neurons and enhanced the antioxidant ability of
      SCOP-induced mice. Western blot confirmed that P. tenuifolia and A. tatarinowii
      down-regulated the protein expression levels of TLR4, NF-kappaB, and related
      inflammatory factors(TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6). All these have suggested
      that P. tenuifolia and A. tatarinowii inhibits AD via multiple components,
      multiple targets, and multiple pathways, which has provided an experimental basis
      for the clinical application of P. tenuifolia and A. tatarinowii for the
      treatment of AD.

      further cognitive decline and AD dementia later in life. Early detection of
      at-risk groups with subjective complaints is critical for targeted dementia
      prevention at the earliest. Accurate assessment of SCD is crucial. However,
      current measures lack important psychometric evaluations and or reporting.
      OBJECTIVES: To systematically evaluate measurement properties of self-reported
      outcome measures (PROMs) used to assess SCD in the older adult population with or
      at risk of AD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We used the Preferred Reporting Items for
      Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols 2015 Checklist for reporting. We
      conducted a literature search, screened, and included validation studies of SCD
      based on self-reported questionnaires from both population-based and clinical
      studies, conducted in older adults (>/= 55). We critically appraised the included
      primary studies using the Consensus-based Standards for the selection of health
      Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) guidelines. RESULTS: Sixteen studies met the
      inclusion criteria. The included studies reported psychometric properties of 17
      SCD self-reported questionnaires. We extracted data on the structural validity,
      internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and cross-cultural validity and
      found a widespread proneness to bias across studies, and a marked heterogeneity
      is assessed and reported measurement properties that prevented the consolidation 
      of results. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that available SCD questionnaires
      lack content validity evaluation. Currently available measurements of SCD lack
      development and validation standards. Further work is needed to develop and
      validate SCD self-reported measurement with good quality measurement properties.

AB  - The cholinesterase inhibitor donepezil is used to improve Abeta pathology and
      cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the impact
      of donepezil on tau pathology is unclear. Thus, we examined the effects of
      donepezil on Abeta and tau pathology in 5xFAD mice (a model of AD) in this study.
      We found that intraperitoneal injection of donepezil (1 mg/kg, i.p.) exhibited
      significant reductions in Abeta plaque number in the cortex and hippocampal DG
      region. In addition, donepezil treatment (1 mg/kg, i.p.) reduced Abeta-mediated
      microglial and, to a lesser extent, astrocytic activation in 5xFAD mice. However,
      neither intraperitoneal/oral injection of donepezil nor oral injection of
      rivastigmine altered tau phosphorylation at Thr212/Ser214 (AT100), Thr396, and
      Thr231 in 5xFAD mice. Surprisingly, we observed that intraperitoneal/oral
      injection of donepezil treatment significantly increased tau phosphorylation at
      Thr212 in 5xFAD mice. Taken together, these data suggest that intraperitoneal
      injection of donepezil suppresses Abeta pathology but not tau pathology in 5xFAD 
      mice.

TI  - The TAS Test project: a prospective longitudinal validation of new online
      motor-cognitive tests to detect preclinical Alzheimer's disease and estimate
      5-year risks of cognitive decline and dementia.
PG  - 266
LID - 10.1186/s12883-022-02772-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The worldwide prevalence of dementia is rapidly rising. Alzheimer's
      disease (AD), accounts for 70% of cases and has a 10-20-year preclinical period, 
      when brain pathology covertly progresses before cognitive symptoms appear. The
      2020 Lancet Commission estimates that 40% of dementia cases could be prevented by
      modifying lifestyle/medical risk factors. To optimise dementia prevention
      effectiveness, there is urgent need to identify individuals with preclinical AD
      for targeted risk reduction. Current preclinical AD tests are too invasive,
      specialist or costly for population-level assessments. We have developed a new
      online test, TAS Test, that assesses a range of motor-cognitive functions and has
      capacity to be delivered at significant scale. TAS Test combines two innovations:
      using hand movement analysis to detect preclinical AD, and computer-human
      interface technologies to enable robust 'self-testing' data collection. The aims 
      are to validate TAS Test to [1] identify preclinical AD, and [2] predict risk of 
      cognitive decline and AD dementia. METHODS: Aim 1 will be addressed through a
      cross-sectional study of 500 cognitively healthy older adults, who will complete 
      TAS Test items comprising measures of motor control, processing speed, attention,
      visuospatial ability, memory and language. TAS Test measures will be compared to 
      a blood-based AD biomarker, phosphorylated tau 181 (p-tau181). Aim 2 will be
      addressed through a 5-year prospective cohort study of 10,000 older adults.
      Participants will complete TAS Test annually and subtests of the Cambridge
      Neuropsychological Test Battery (CANTAB) biennially. 300 participants will
      undergo in-person clinical assessments. We will use machine learning of
      motor-cognitive performance on TAS Test to develop an algorithm that classifies
      preclinical AD risk (p-tau181-defined) and determine the precision to
      prospectively estimate 5-year risks of cognitive decline and AD. DISCUSSION: This
      study will establish the precision of TAS Test to identify preclinical AD and
      estimate risk of cognitive decline and AD. If accurate, TAS Test will provide a
      low-cost, accessible enrichment strategy to pre-screen individuals for their
      likelihood of AD pathology prior to more expensive tests such as blood or imaging
      biomarkers. This would have wide applications in public health initiatives and
      clinical trials. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05194787 ,

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neuroimaging suggests that white matter microstructure is severely
      affected in Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. However, whether alterations in
      white matter microstructure are confined to specific regions and whether they can
      be used as potential biomarkers to distinguish normal control (NC) from AD are
      unknown. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 33 cases of AD and 25 cases of
      NC were recruited for automatic fiber quantification (AFQ). A total of 20 fiber
      bundles were equally divided into 100 segments for quantitative assessment of
      fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), volume and curvature. In order
      to further evaluate the diagnostic value, the maximum redundancy minimum (mRMR)
      and LASSO algorithms were used to select features, calculate the Radscore of each
      subject, establish logistic regression models, and draw ROC curves, respectively,
      to assess the predictive power of four different models. RESULTS: There was a
      significant increase in the MD values in AD patients compared with healthy
      subjects. The differences were mainly located in the left cingulum hippocampus
      (HCC), left uncinate fasciculus (UF) and superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF). 
      The point-wise level of 20 fiber bundles was used as a classification feature,
      and the MD index exhibited the best performance to distinguish NC from AD.
      CONCLUSION: These findings contribute to the understanding of the pathogenesis of
      AD and suggest that abnormal white matter based on DTI-based AFQ analysis is
      helpful to explore the pathogenesis of AD.

TI  - Novel PSEN1 (P284S) Mutation Causes Alzheimer's Disease with Cerebellar Amyloid
      beta-protein deposition.
LID - 10.2174/1567205019666220718151357 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: AD-associated PSEN1 mutations exhibit high clinical
      heterogeneity. The discovery of these mutations and the analysis of their
      associations with cases such as EOAD should be critical to understand the
      pathogenesis of AD. METHODS: We performed clinical analysis, neuroimaging, target
      region capture and high-throughput sequencing, and Sanger sequencing in a family 
      of 3 generations. The underlying Alzheimer's pathology was evaluated by using
      biomarker evidence obtained from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid testing and
      18F-florbetapir (AV-45) PET imaging. RESULTS: Target region capture sequencing
      revealed a novel heterozygous C to T missense point mutation at the base position
      284 (c.850 CT,) located in exon 8 of the PSEN1 gene, resulting in a
      Proline-to-Serine substitution (P284S) at codon position 850. The mutation was
      also identified by Sanger sequencing in 2 family members including proband and
      her daughter and was absent in the other 4 unaffected family members and 50
      control subjects. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid test exhibited biomarker
      evidence of underlying Alzheimer's pathology. 18F-florbetapir (AV-45) PET imaging
      indicated extensive cerebral cortex and cerebellar Abeta deposition. CONCLUSIONS:
      We discovered a novel PSEN1 pathogenic mutation P284S, which was observed for the
      first time in a Chinese family with early-onset AD.

AB  - Age is the strongest risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In recent years,
      the relationship between aging and AD has been widely studied, with anti-aging
      therapeutics as the treatment for AD being one of the mainstream research
      directions. Therapeutics targeting senescent cells have shown improvement in AD
      symptoms and cerebral pathological changes, suggesting that anti-aging strategies
      may be a promising alternative for AD treatment. Nanoparticles represent an
      excellent approach for efficiently crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to
      achieve better curative function and fewer side effects. Thereby,
      nanoparticles-based anti-aging treatment may exert potent anti-AD therapeutic
      efficacy. This review discusses the relationship between aging and AD and the
      application and prospect of anti-aging strategies and nanoparticle-based
      therapeutics in treating AD.

AB  - Lithium-salts stand on the first line of therapy for the management of specific
      psychiatric conditions, mainly bipolar mood disorder. It is also known to protect
      the brain against neurodegenerative processes such as Alzheimer's disease.
      Despite the mentioned merits, recent studies have revealed that high dose or
      prolonged lithium intake deteriorate the function of multiple key organs
      including heart, ovaries, thyroid gland and kidneys. Mechanistically, both
      positive and negative effects of lithium are mediated through methylation of
      beta-catenin nuclear-binding proteins which is potentiated by lithium-induced
      inhibition of GSK-3 or inositol monophosphatase. The current study briefly
      reviews the recent experimental data on lithium therapy considering both positive
      (i.e., neuroprotective) and negative aspects. In this regard, the question is
      that whether doses of lithium administered in experimental research are
      comparable with the therapeutic doses, as currently prescribed in clinical
      practice. It should be noted that the experimental data on animal studies, as
      widely reviewed here, could not be directly generalized to clinic. This is mainly
      because lithium doses applied in animal models are usually higher than
      therapeutic doses, however, there are evidence indicating that even animal to
      human translated doses of lithium, cause serious complications and this has been 
      reported by meta-analyses on human studies. Therefore, we suggest the clinicians 
      to use lithium-salts with precaution particularly in pregnancy and precisely
      adjust lithium concentration considering the patient's general health status to
      avoid lithium toxicity. Indeed, alternative approaches are recommended when the
      subject is pregnant, prolonged therapy is required or specific organ dysfunction 
      is diagnosed.

AB  - This study investigates the barriers and promoters of caring for older adults
      living with Alzheimer's Dementia (AD) in families. This was a qualitative study
      through content analysis (based on the Granheim and Lundman method), and the
      participants were selected using purposive sampling from the families of older
      adults living with AD who were receiving care in the community. We used
      semi-structured interviews to collect data from 32 family members. The validity
      and reliability of the data were assessed using the Lincoln and Guba criteria. In
      this study, 70.58% of primary caregivers were women. Caregiving facilitators
      included "Efficient family," "Capable caregiver," and "Motivated caregiver."
      Caregiving barriers included "Lacking awareness and knowledge," "Vulnerable
      family," "Older person with complex/multiple needs," and "Lack of care
      infrastructures." Training families and caregivers and developing care
      infrastructures for older adults with AD can help reduce caring barriers in older
      adults.

AB  - This study aimed to determine the risk factors of frailty in Chinese older
      patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and then construct a nomogram for frailty 
      in this population. A total of 205 eligible older AD patients were recruited.
      Patients' general demographic characteristics were collected through a
      self-designed questionnaire. A nomogram was constructed for frailty based on the 
      risk factors identified from the multivariate analysis. The discrimination and
      calibration capabilities of this nomogram were assessed with the C-index and
      calibration curve, respectively. The results showed that older age, no regular
      exercise habit, severe cognitive decline, and low social support were identified 
      as important risk factors of frailty in AD patients. The C-index of the nomogram 
      was 0.884 by bootstrapping validation, and the calibration curve of the nomogram 
      showed high coherence between the predicted and actual probabilities of frailty. 
      In conclusion, this nomogram was validated to have favorable discrimination and
      calibration capabilities.

AB  - Dysregulation of gene expression in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains elusive,
      especially at the cell type level. Gene regulatory network, a key molecular
      mechanism linking transcription factors (TFs) and regulatory elements to govern
      gene expression, can change across cell types in the human brain and thus serve
      as a model for studying gene dysregulation in AD. However, AD-induced regulatory 
      changes across brain cell types remains uncharted. To address this, we integrated
      single-cell multi-omics datasets to predict the gene regulatory networks of four 
      major cell types, excitatory and inhibitory neurons, microglia and
      oligodendrocytes, in control and AD brains. Importantly, we analyzed and compared
      the structural and topological features of networks across cell types and
      examined changes in AD. Our analysis shows that hub TFs are largely common across
      cell types and AD-related changes are relatively more prominent in some cell
      types (e.g., microglia). The regulatory logics of enriched network motifs (e.g., 
      feed-forward loops) further uncover cell type-specific TF-TF cooperativities in
      gene regulation. The cell type networks are also highly modular and several
      network modules with cell-type-specific expression changes in AD pathology are
      enriched with AD-risk genes. The further disease-module-drug association analysis
      suggests cell-type candidate drugs and their potential target genes. Finally, our
      network-based machine learning analysis systematically prioritized cell type risk
      genes likely involved in AD. Our strategy is validated using an independent
      dataset which showed that top ranked genes can predict clinical phenotypes (e.g.,
      cognitive impairment) of AD with reasonable accuracy. Overall, this single-cell
      network biology analysis provides a comprehensive map linking genes, regulatory
      networks, cell types and drug targets and reveals cell-type gene dysregulation in
      AD.

TI  - Microglial mitophagy integrates the microbiota-gut-brain axis to restrain
      neuroinflammation during neurotropic herpesvirus infection.

AB  - Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE), mainly caused by herpes simplex virus type 1
      (HSV-1), is a severe central nervous system disease commonly followed by
      cognitive impairment, behavioral changes, and focal neurological signs. Although 
      increasing evidence implicates the central role of microglia in HSE progression, 
      the intrinsic restrictors or the acquired environmental factors that balance the 
      beneficial or detrimental immune responses in microglia remain unclear. In a
      recent study, we find that a gut microbial metabolite activates mitophagy to
      regulate microglia-mediated neuroinflammation and to mitigate HSE progression.
      HSV-1 neurotropic infection causes gut microbiota dysbiosis and microglial
      antiviral immune response, whereas depletion of gut microbiota by oral
      antibiotics treatment further results in hyperactivated microglia and exacerbated
      HSE pathology. Notably, exogenous administration of nicotinamide n-oxide (NAMO), 
      an oxidative product of nicotinamide mainly produced by intestinal
      neomycin-sensitive bacteria, especially Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus
      reuteri, can significantly suppress HSE progression. Mechanistically, HSV-1
      infection causes mitochondrial dysfunction and impairs mitophagy to activate
      microglia and promote proinflammatory cytokine production, whereas NAMO restores 
      NAD+-dependent mitophagy to restrain microglial over-activation and to prevent
      HSV-1 early infection in neuronal cells. This work reveals a novel function of
      gut microbial metabolites as intrinsic regulators of microglia homeostasis and
      neuroinflammation via mitophagy.Abbreviations: AD: Alzheimer disease; ABX:

TI  - Development and internal validation of a prognostic model for 15-year risk of
      Alzheimer dementia in primary care patients.
LID - 10.1007/s10072-022-06258-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The exploitation of routinely collected clinical health information
      is warranted to optimize the case detection and diagnostic workout of Alzheimer's
      disease (AD). We aimed to derive an AD prediction score based on routinely
      collected primary care data. METHODS: We built a cohort selecting 199,978 primary
      care patients 60 + part of the Health Search Database between January 2002 and
      2009, followed up until 2019 to detect incident AD cases. The cohort was randomly
      divided into a derivation and validation sub-cohort. To identify AD and non-AD
      cases, we applied a clinical algorithm that involved two clinicians. According to
      a nested case-control design, AD cases were matched with up to 10 controls based 
      on age, sex, calendar period, and follow-up duration. Using the derivation
      sub-cohort, 32 potential AD predictors (sociodemographic, clinical, drug-related,
      etc.) were tested in a logistic regression and selected to build a prediction
      model. The predictive performance of this model was tested on the validation
      sub-cohort by mean of explained variation, calibration, and discrimination
      measurements. RESULTS: We identified 3223 AD cases. The presence of memory
      disorders, hallucinations, anxiety, and depression and the use of NSAIDs were
      associated with future AD. The combination of the predictors allowed the
      production of a predictive score that showed an explained variation (pseudo-R(2))
      for AD occurrence of 13.4%, good calibration parameters, and an area under the
      curve of 0.73 (95% CI: 0.71-0.75). In accordance with this model, 7% of patients 
      presented with a high-risk score for developing AD over 15 years. CONCLUSION: An 
      automated risk score for AD based on routinely collected clinical data is a
      promising tool for the early case detection and timely management of patients by 
      the general practitioners.

TI  - Reactive astrogliosis is associated with higher cerebral glucose consumption in
      the early Alzheimer's continuum.
LID - 10.1007/s00259-022-05897-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Glial activation is one of the earliest mechanisms to be altered in
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) relates to
      reactive astrogliosis and can be measured in both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and
      blood. Plasma GFAP has been suggested to become altered earlier in AD than its
      CSF counterpart. Although astrocytes consume approximately half of the
      glucose-derived energy in the brain, the relationship between reactive
      astrogliosis and cerebral glucose metabolism is poorly understood. Here, we aimed
      to investigate the association between fluorodeoxyglucose ([(18)F]FDG) uptake and
      reactive astrogliosis, by means of GFAP quantified in both plasma and CSF for the
      same participants. METHODS: We included 314 cognitively unimpaired participants
      from the ALFA + cohort, 112 of whom were amyloid-beta (Abeta) positive.
      Associations between GFAP markers and [(18)F]FDG uptake were studied. We also
      investigated whether these associations were modified by Abeta and tau status (AT
      stages). RESULTS: Plasma GFAP was positively associated with glucose consumption 
      in the whole brain, while CSF GFAP associations with [(18)F]FDG uptake were only 
      observed in specific smaller areas like temporal pole and superior temporal lobe.
      These associations persisted when accounting for biomarkers of Abeta pathology
      but became negative in Abeta-positive and tau-positive participants (A + T +) in 
      similar areas of AD-related hypometabolism. CONCLUSIONS: Higher astrocytic
      reactivity, probably in response to early AD pathological changes, is related to 
      higher glucose consumption. With the onset of tau pathology, the observed
      uncoupling between astrocytic biomarkers and glucose consumption might be
      indicative of a failure to sustain the higher energetic demands required by
      reactive astrocytes.

AB  - Given the highly variable clinical phenotype of Coronavirus disease 2019
      (COVID-19), a deeper analysis of the host genetic contribution to severe COVID-19
      is important to improve our understanding of underlying disease mechanisms. Here,
      we describe an extended GWAS meta-analysis of a well-characterized cohort of 3255
      COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure and 12 488 population controls from
      Italy, Spain, Norway and Germany/Austria, including stratified analyses based on 
      age, sex and disease severity, as well as targeted analyses of chromosome Y
      haplotypes, the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region and the SARS-CoV-2
      peptidome. By inversion imputation, we traced a reported association at 17q21.31 
      to a ~ 0.9-Mb inversion polymorphism that creates two highly differentiated
      haplotypes and characterized the potential effects of the inversion in detail.
      Our data, together with the 5th release of summary statistics from the COVID-19
      Host Genetics Initiative including non-Caucasian individuals, also identified a
      new locus at 19q13.33, including NAPSA, a gene which is expressed primarily in
      alveolar cells responsible for gas exchange in the lung.

      expression microarrays and 1 gene methylation microarray were downloaded for
      identification of differentially expressed genes and differentially methylated
      genes. Then, we used various biological information databases to annotate the
      functions of the differentially-methylated/expressed genes, and screen out key
      genes and important signaling pathways. Finally, we validate the
      differentially-methylated/expressed genes in the additional online datasets and
      in blood from AD patients.Results: A total of 8 hub hypomethylated-high
      expression genes were obtained, including Rac family small GTPase 2, FGR
      proto-oncogene, Src family tyrosine kinase, LYN proto-oncogene, Src family
      tyrosine kinase, protein kinase C delta, myosin IF, integrin subunit alpha 5,
      semaphorin 4D, and growth arrest specific protein 7. Some enriched signaling
      pathways of hypomethylated-high expression genes were identified, including
      regulation of actin cytoskeleton, chemokine signaling pathway, Fc gamma
      R-mediated phagocytosis, and axon guidance. Conclusion:
      Differentially-methylated/expressed genes are likely to be associated with AD.

      a qualitative analysis of awareness of relationships in people with dementia.
PG  - 1-7
LID - 10.1080/13607863.2022.2084503 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the presence of awareness of changes in relationships 
      domain, and additional subdomains (cognitive, emotional and functional status) in
      a group of participants with dementia. METHOD: Using a qualitative design, 9
      participants with mild and moderate dementia attended in a day care center were
      interviewed. Analyses were implemented throughout the modified version of the
      Grounded Theory Method. RESULTS: Some participants well-recognized changes in
      their relationships, albeit a tendency to immediately deny those changes was
      observed among them. The participants' reports showed that the kind of familiar
      or social relationship might facilitate the expression of awareness. Less
      discomfort in social interactions with familiars and friends compared to
      embarrassment with unfamiliar relationships were described. All participants
      could partially recognize their cognitive deficits, although attempts to
      normalize their condition and minimize difficulties were identified. Only two
      participants partially recognized changes in all investigated domains. The other 
      participants partially described changes in two domains beyond the cognitive
      domain, such as relationships and emotional status or emotional and functional
      status. However, answers concerning emotional status reflected that some coping
      styles were not related to a general condition. CONCLUSION: The relationship
      domain may provide a valuable perspective of awareness of disease. People with
      dementia may feel less embarrassed to recognize deficits in the presence of
      familiars and friends.

TI  - Osteoarthritis and APOE4 Interact to Influence Memory Decline in Non-Demented
      Older People.
LID - 10.3233/JAD-220138 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The question that whether the presence of osteoarthritis (OA) can
      modify the effects of apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) genotype on longitudinal change
      in cognitive performance among non-demented older people remains unclear.
      OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the association of APOE4 genotype with change in
      verbal episodic memory over time is modified by the presence of OA among
      non-demented older people. METHODS: Longitudinal data from 1,400 non-demented
      older people were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
      database. The sample included 466 healthy individuals and 934 mild cognitive
      impairment. The effects of the OAxAPOE4 genotype interaction term on longitudinal
      change in cognitive performance were examined using linear mixed-effects
      regression models. Global cognition was assessed by the Mini-Mental State
      Examination score and Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes. Verbal episodic
      memory was evaluated by the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) immediate
      recall and delayed recall score. RESULTS: We found that OA interacted with APOE4 
      genotype to influence longitudinal change in verbal episodic memory (as assessed 
      by RAVLT immediate recall score) but not global cognition. Specifically, the
      OA-/APOE4+ group had a steeper decline in RAVLT immediate recall score compared
      with the OA+/APOE4+ group. However, there was no difference in RAVLT immediate
      recall score between OA-/APOE4-and OA+/APOE4-individuals. CONCLUSION: Our study
      suggested that the association of APOE4 genotype with change in RAVLT immediate
      recall score over time is modified by the presence of OA at earliest stages of
      the disease.

TI  - Does Loss of Integrity of the Cingulum Bundle Link Amyloid-beta Accumulation and 
      Neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's Disease?
LID - 10.3233/JAD-220024 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the accumulation of
      amyloid-beta (Abeta) into plaques, aggregation of tau into neurofibrillary
      tangles, and neurodegenerative processes including atrophy. However, there is a
      poorly understood spatial discordance between initial Abeta deposition and local 
      neurodegeneration. OBJECTIVE: Here, we test the hypothesis that the cingulum
      bundle links Abeta deposition in the cingulate cortex to medial temporal lobe
      (MTL) atrophy. METHODS: 21 participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from
      the UMC Utrecht memory clinic (UMCU, discovery sample) and 37 participants with
      MCI from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, replication sample)
      with available Abeta-PET scan, T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted MRI were
      included. Abeta load of the cingulate cortex was measured by the standardized
      uptake value ratio (SUVR), white matter integrity of the cingulum bundle was
      assessed by mean diffusivity and atrophy of the MTL by normalized MTL volume.
      Relationships were tested with linear mixed models, to accommodate multiple
      measures for each participant. RESULTS: We found at most a weak association
      between cingulate Abeta and MTL volume (added R2 <0.06), primarily for the
      posterior hippocampus. In neither sample, white matter integrity of the cingulum 
      bundle was associated with cingulate Abeta or MTL volume (added R2 <0.01).
      Various sensitivity analyses (Abeta-positive individuals only, posterior
      cingulate SUVR, MTL sub region volume) provided similar results. CONCLUSION:
      These findings, consistent in two independent cohorts, do not support our
      hypothesis that loss of white matter integrity of the cingulum is a connecting
      factor between cingulate gyrus Abeta deposition and MTL atrophy.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition that causes cognitive
      decline over time. Because existing diagnostic approaches for AD are limited,
      improving upon previously established diagnostic models based on genetic
      biomarkers is necessary. Firstly, four AD gene expression datasets were collected
      from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Two datasets were used to
      establish diagnostic models, and the other two datasets were used to verify the
      model effect. We merged GSE5281 with GSE44771 as the training dataset and found
      120 DEGs. Then, we used random forest (RF) to screen 6 key genes (KLF15, MAFF,
      ITPKB, SST, DDIT4, and NRXN3) as being critical for separating AD and normal
      samples. The weights of these key genes were measured, and a diagnostic model was
      created using an artificial neural network (ANN). The area under the curve (AUC) 
      of the model is 0.953, while the accuracy is 0.914. In the final step, two
      validation datasets were utilized to assess AUC performance. In GSE109887, our
      model had an AUC of 0.854, and in GSE132903, it had an AUC of 0.810. To
      summarize, we successfully identified key gene biomarkers and developed a new AD 
      diagnostic model.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent and deleterious neurodegenerative
      disorder characterized by an irreversible and progressive impairment of cognitive
      abilities as well as the formation of amyloid beta (Abeta) plaques and
      neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the brain. By far, the precise mechanisms of AD
      are not fully understood and no interventions are available to effectively slow
      down progression of the disease. Autophagy is a conserved degradation pathway
      that is crucial to maintain cellular homeostasis by targeting damaged organelles,
      pathogens, and disease-prone protein aggregates to lysosome for degradation.
      Emerging evidence suggests dysfunctional autophagy clearance pathway as a
      potential cellular mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of AD in affected
      neurons. Here we summarize the current evidence for autophagy dysfunction in the 
      pathophysiology of AD and discuss the role of autophagy in the regulation of
      AD-related protein degradation and neuroinflammation in neurons and glial cells. 
      Finally, we review the autophagy modulators reported in the treatment of AD
      models and discuss the obstacles and opportunities for potential clinical
      application of the novel autophagy activators for AD therapy.

      (Ibu&FK@RNPs), which can target the receptor of advanced glycation endproducts
      (RAGE) and response to the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in AD.
      RAGE is highly and specifically expressed on the lesion neurovascular unit of AD,
      this property helps to improve targeting specificity of the system and reduce
      unselective distribution in normal brain. Meanwhile, these two drugs can be
      specifically released in astrocytes of AD lesion in response to high levels of
      ROS. As a result, the cognition of AD mice was significantly improved and the
      quantity of Abeta plaques was decreased. Neurotoxicity was also alleviated with
      structural regeneration and functional recovery of neurons. Besides, the
      neuroinflammation dominated by NF-kappaB pathway was significantly inhibited with
      decreased NF-kappaB and IL-1beta in the brain. Overall, Ibu&FK@RNPs can
      efficiently and successively target diseased BBB and astrocytes in AD lesion.
      Thus it significantly enhances intracephalic accumulation of drugs and
      efficiently treats AD by anti-neuroinflammation and neuroprotection.

TI  - Celastrol enhances transcription factor EB (TFEB)-mediated autophagy and
      mitigates Tau pathology: Implications for Alzheimer's disease therapy.
PG  - 1707-1722
LID - 10.1016/j.apsb.2022.01.017 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD), characterized by the accumulation of protein aggregates
      including phosphorylated Tau aggregates, is the most common neurodegenerative
      disorder with limited therapeutic agents. Autophagy plays a critical role in the 
      degradation of phosphorylated Tau aggregates, and transcription factor EB (TFEB) 
      is a master regulator of autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis. Thus, small-molecule
      autophagy enhancers targeting TFEB hold promise for AD therapy. Here, we found
      that celastrol, an active ingredient isolated from the root extracts of
      Tripterygium wilfordii (Lei Gong Teng in Chinese) enhanced TFEB-mediated
      autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis in vitro and in mouse brains. Importantly,
      celastrol reduced phosphorylated Tau aggregates and attenuated memory dysfunction
      and cognitive deficits in P301S Tau and 3xTg mice, two commonly used AD animal
      models. Mechanistical studies suggest that TFEB-mediated autophagy-lysosomal
      pathway is responsible for phosphorylated Tau degradation in response to
      celastrol. Overall, our findings indicate that Celastrol is a novel TFEB
      activator that promotes the degradation of phosphorylated Tau aggregates and
      improves memory in AD animal models. Therefore, Celastrol shows potential as a
      novel agent for the treatment and/or prevention of AD and other tauopathies.

AB  - Discovery of drugs rapidly and effectively is an important aspect for Alzheimer's
      disease (AD). In this study, a novel high-throughput screening (HTS) method aims 
      at screening the small-molecules with amyloid-beta (Abeta) binding affinity from 
      natural medicines, based on the combinational use of biolayer interferometry
      (BLI) and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode-array
      detector and quadrupole/time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry
      (UHPLC-DAD-Q/TOF-MS/MS) has been firstly developed. Briefly, the components in
      natural medicines disassociated from biotinylated Abeta were collected to analyze
      their potential Abeta binding affinity by UHPLC-DAD-Q/TOF-MS/MS. Here, baicalein 
      was confirmed to exhibit the highest binding affinity with Abeta in Scutellaria
      baicalensis. Moreover, polyporenic acid C (PPAC), dehydrotumulosic acid (DTA),
      and tumulosic acid (TA) in Kai-Xin-San (KXS) were also identified as potent Abeta
      inhibitors. Further bioactivity validations indicated that these compounds could 
      inhibit Abeta fibrillation, improve the viability in Abeta-induced PC-12 cells,
      and decrease the Abeta content and improve the behavioral ability in
      Caenorhabditis elegans. The molecular docking results confirmed that PPAC, DTA,
      and TA possessed good binding properties with Abeta. Collectively, the present
      study has provided a novel and effective HTS method for the identification of
      natural inhibitors on Abeta fibrillation, which may accelerate the process on
      anti-AD drugs discovery and development.

TI  - Risk of Neutropenia in Adults Treated with Piperacillin-Tazobactam or Cefazolin: 
      A Retrospective Cohort Study.
PG  - 186-192
LID - 10.4212/cjhp.3161 [doi]
AB  - Background: Neutropenia is an adverse effect associated with the use of several
      antibiotics, including piperacillin-tazobactam (P/T). Previous findings have
      suggested that the risk of neutropenia in children is significantly higher with
      P/T than with ticarcillin-clavulanate. Objectives: To compare the risk of
      neutropenia associated with P/T and with cefazolin in an adult population and to 
      describe the characteristics of neutropenia episodes observed. Methods: This
      descriptive retrospective study involved patients aged 18 years or older who
      received a minimum of 10 days of treatment with P/T or cefazolin between January 
      2009 and December 2013. Patients who experienced neutropenia (absolute neutrophil
      count < 1.5 x 10(9)/L) were compared, using univariate and multivariate logistic 
      regression models, between those who received P/T and those who received
      cefazolin. Results: A total of 207 patients were included (104 who received P/T
      and 103 who received cefazolin). Ten episodes of neutropenia were observed, 5
      with each antibiotic (4.8% and 4.9%, respectively; odds ratio 0.99, 95%
      confidence interval 0.278-3.527). The mean cumulative dose of piperacillin was
      290.4 g among patients who experienced neutropenia and 247.0 g among all patients
      treated with P/T, and the mean treatment duration was 24.0 days and 21.0 days,
      respectively. The average time before the onset of neutropenia was slightly
      longer with P/T than with cefazolin (22.0 versus 17.2 days, p = 0.38).
      Conclusions: Although these results require confirmation in a larger clinical
      trial (to lessen possible attribution bias), the risk of neutropenia appeared to 
      be similar between P/T and cefazolin.

AB  - We aimed to evaluate the feasibility of using real-world register data for
      identifying persons with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to describe their
      cognitive performance at the time of diagnosis. Patients diagnosed with AD during
      2010-2013 (aged 60-81 years) were identified from the Finnish national health
      registers and enlarged with a smaller private sector sample (total n = 1,268).
      Patients with other disorders impacting cognition were excluded. Detailed
      clinical and cognitive screening data (the Consortium to Establish a Registry for
      Alzheimer's Disease neuropsychological battery [CERAD-nb]) were obtained from
      local health records. Adequate cognitive data were available for 389 patients
      with mild AD (31%) of the entire AD group. The main reasons for not including
      patients in analyses of cognitive performance were AD diagnosis at a
      moderate/severe stage (n = 266, 21%), AD diagnosis given before full register
      coverage (n = 152, 12%), and missing CERAD-nb data (n = 139, 11%). The cognitive 
      performance of persons with late-onset AD (n = 284), mixed cerebrovascular
      disease and AD (n = 51), and other AD subtypes (n = 54) was compared with that of
      a non-demented sample (n = 1980) from the general population. Compared with the
      other AD groups, patients with late-onset AD performed the worst in word list
      recognition, while patients with mixed cerebrovascular disease and AD performed
      the worst in constructional praxis and clock drawing tests. A combination of
      national registers and local health records can be used to collect data relevant 
      for cognitive screening; today, the process is laborious, but it could be
      improved in the future with refined search algorithms and electronic data.

      disease.
PG  - e12319
LID - 10.1002/trc2.12319 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Human study shows that elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) in blood
      impacts apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4, but not APOE epsilon3 or APOE epsilon2,
      genotype to increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, whether CRP
      is directly involved in cellular AD pathogenesis and in which type of neuronal
      cells of APOE epsilon4 carriers are unknown. Methods: We aimed to use different
      primary neuronal cells and investigate if CRP induces cellular AD pathology
      depending on APOE genotypes. Here the different primary neuronal cells from the
      different APOE genotype knock-in mice cortex were isolated and used. Results:
      Monomeric CRP (mCRP) increased amyloid beta production and, in parallel, induced 
      tau phosphorylation in addition to their related proteins in the primary neurons 
      in a pattern of APOE epsilon4 > APOE epsilon3 > APOE epsilon2 in a dose- and
      time-dependent manner. Consistently, mCRP induced the staining of other
      neurodegenerative biomarkers, including Fluoro-Jade B stain (FjB), TUNEL and
      Cleaved Caspase-3, in primary neurons in a similar pattern of APOE epsilon4 >
      APOE epsilon3 > APOE epsilon2. In contrast, pentameric CRP (pCRP) had a tendency 
      to induce cellular AD pathology but did not reach statistical significance. On
      the other hand, it is intriguing that regardless of APOE genotype, mCRP did not
      influence the expressions of Iba-1 and CD68 in primary microglia or the
      expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein in primary astrocytes, and
      additionally mCRP did not affect the secretions of interleukin (IL)-1alpha,
      IL-1beta, and tumor necrosis factor alpha from these cells. Discussion: This is
      the first report to demonstrate that mCRP directly induces cellular AD
      pathogenesis in neurons in an APOE genotype-dependent pattern, suggesting that
      mCRP plays a role as a mediator involved in the APOE epsilon4-related pathway for
      AD during chronic inflammation. Highlights: Pentameric C-reactive protein (pCRP) 
      can be dissociated irreversibly to form free subunits or monomeric CRP (mCRP)
      during and after the acute phase.mCRP increased amyloid beta production in the
      primary neurons in a pattern of apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 > APOE epsilon3 
      > APOE epsilon2 in a dose-dependent manner.mCRP induced the expression of
      phosphorylated tau in the primary neurons in a pattern of APOE epsilon4 > APOE
      epsilon3 > APOE epsilon2 in a dose- and time-dependent manner.mCRP plays an
      important mediator role in the APOE epsilon4-related pathway of Alzheimer's
      disease risk.

TI  - Measurement of neurodegeneration using a multivariate early frame amyloid PET
      classifier.
PG  - e12325
LID - 10.1002/trc2.12325 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Amyloid measurement provides important confirmation of pathology
      for Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials. However, many amyloid positive
      (Am+) early-stage subjects do not worsen clinically during a clinical trial, and 
      a neurodegenerative measure predictive of decline could provide critical
      information. Studies have shown correspondence between perfusion measured by
      early amyloid frames post-tracer injection and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron 
      emission tomography (PET), but with limitations in sensitivity. Multivariate
      machine learning approaches may offer a more sensitive means for detection of
      disease related changes as we have demonstrated with FDG. Methods: Using summed
      dynamic florbetapir image frames acquired during the first 6 minutes
      post-injection for 107 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative subjects, we
      applied optimized machine learning to develop and test image classifiers aimed at
      measuring AD progression. Early frame amyloid (EFA) classification was compared
      to that of an independently developed FDG PET AD progression classifier by
      scoring the FDG scans of the same subjects at the same time point. Score
      distributions and correlation with clinical endpoints were compared to those
      obtained from FDG. Region of interest measures were compared between EFA and FDG 
      to further understand discrimination performance. Results: The EFA classifier
      produced a primary pattern similar to that of the FDG classifier whose expression
      correlated highly with the FDG pattern (R-squared 0.71), discriminated
      cognitively normal (NL) amyloid negative (Am-) subjects from all Am+ groups, and 
      that correlated in Am+ subjects with Mini-Mental State Examination, Clinical
      Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes, and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-13-item
      Cognitive subscale (R = 0.59, 0.63, 0.73) and with subsequent 24-month changes in
      these measures (R = 0.67, 0.73, 0.50). Discussion: Our results support the
      ability to use EFA with a multivariate machine learning-derived classifier to
      obtain a sensitive measure of AD-related loss in neuronal function that
      correlates with FDG PET in preclinical and early prodromal stages as well as in
      late mild cognitive impairment and dementia. Highlights: The summed initial
      post-injection minutes of florbetapir positron emission tomography correlate with
      fluorodeoxyglucose.A machine learning classifier enabled sensitive detection of
      early prodromal Alzheimer's disease.Early frame amyloid (EFA) classifier scores
      correlate with subsequent change in Mini-Mental State Examination, Clinical
      Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes, and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-13-item
      Cognitive subscale.EFA classifier effect sizes and clinical prediction
      outperformed region of interest standardized uptake value ratio.EFA
      classification may aid in stratifying patients to assess treatment effect.

PG  - e12315
LID - 10.1002/trc2.12315 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Evidence from epidemiology, neuroimaging, and animal models
      indicates that asthma adversely affects the brain, but the nature and extent of
      neuropathophysiological impact remain unclear. Methods: We tested the hypothesis 
      that asthma is a risk factor for dementia by comparing cognitive performance and 
      cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of glial activation/neuroinflammation,
      neurodegeneration, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology in 60 participants with
      asthma to 315 non-asthma age-matched control participants (45-93 years), in a
      sample enriched for AD risk. Results: Participants with severe asthma had higher 
      neurogranin concentrations compared to controls and those with mild asthma.
      Positive relationships between cardiovascular risk and concentrations of
      neurogranin and alpha-synuclein were amplified in severe asthma. Severe asthma
      also amplified the deleterious associations that apolipoprotein E epsilon4
      carrier status, cardiovascular risk, and phosphorylated tau181/amyloid beta42
      have with rate of cognitive decline. Discussion: Our data suggest that severe
      asthma is associated with synaptic degeneration and may compound risk for
      dementia posed by cardiovascular disease and genetic predisposition. Highlights: 
      Those with severe asthma showed evidence of higher dementia risk than controls
      evidenced by: higher levels of the synaptic degeneration biomarker neurogranin
      regardless of cognitive status, cardiovascular or genetic risk, and controlling
      for demographics.steeper increase in levels of synaptic degeneration biomarkers
      neurogranin and alpha-synuclein with increasing cardiovascular risk.accelerated
      cognitive decline with higher cardiovascular risk, genetic predisposition, or

TI  - Autophagy in health and disease: From molecular mechanisms to therapeutic target.
PG  - e150
LID - 10.1002/mco2.150 [doi]
AB  - Macroautophagy/autophagy is an evolutionally conserved catabolic process in which
      cytosolic contents, such as aggregated proteins, dysfunctional organelle, or
      invading pathogens, are sequestered by the double-membrane structure termed
      autophagosome and delivered to lysosome for degradation. Over the past two
      decades, autophagy has been extensively studied, from the molecular mechanisms,
      biological functions, implications in various human diseases, to development of
      autophagy-related therapeutics. This review will focus on the latest development 
      of autophagy research, covering molecular mechanisms in control of autophagosome 
      biogenesis and autophagosome-lysosome fusion, and the upstream regulatory
      pathways including the AMPK and MTORC1 pathways. We will also provide a
      systematic discussion on the implication of autophagy in various human diseases, 
      including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders (Alzheimer disease, Parkinson
      disease, Huntington's disease, and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), metabolic
      diseases (obesity and diabetes), viral infection especially SARS-Cov-2 and
      COVID-19, cardiovascular diseases (cardiac ischemia/reperfusion and
      cardiomyopathy), and aging. Finally, we will also summarize the development of
      pharmacological agents that have therapeutic potential for clinical applications 
      via targeting the autophagy pathway. It is believed that decades of hard work on 
      autophagy research is eventually to bring real and tangible benefits for
      improvement of human health and control of human diseases.

AB  - Introduction: The impact of hepatorenal function on plasma biomarkers of
      neuropathology is unknown. Herein, we measured several plasma biomarkers in
      patients with cirrhosis. Methods: Plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau181),
      neurofilament light chain (NfL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), total
      tau (t-tau), and ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1) were measured
      in 135 adults with cirrhosis and 22 healthy controls using Simoa. Within
      cirrhosis, associations between biomarkers and hepatorenal function were explored
      using linear regression. Results: p-tau181, NfL, t-tau, and UCHL1 were increased 
      2- to 4-fold in cirrhosis, whereas GFAP was not increased. Within cirrhosis,
      creatinine moderately correlated with p-tau181 (beta = 0.75, P < .01), NfL (beta 
      = 0.32, P < .01), and t-tau (beta = 0.31, P < .01), but not GFAP (beta = -0.01, P
      = .88) or UCHL1 (beta = -0.05, P = .60), whereas albumin showed weak, inverse
      correlations: p-tau181 (beta = -0.18, P < .01), NfL (beta = -0.22, P < .01), GFAP
      (beta = -0.17, P < .05), t-tau (beta = -0.20, P = .02), and UCHL1 (beta = -0.15, 
      P = .09). Conclusions: Elevated p-tau181, NfL, and t-tau in cirrhosis were
      associated with renal impairment and hypoalbuminemia, suggesting that hepatorenal
      function may be important when interpreting plasma biomarkers of neuropathology.

AB  - Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is a kind of irreversible vision loss or
      disease caused by retinal pigment epithelial cells and neuroretinal degeneration,
      which has become the main cause of vision loss and blindness of the elderly over 
      65 years old in developed countries. The main clinical manifestations are
      cognitive decline, mental symptoms and behavioral disorders, and the gradual
      decline of daily living ability. In this paper, a feature extraction method of
      electroencephalogram (EEG) signal based on multi-spectral image fusion of
      multi-brain regions is proposed based on artificial neural network (ANN). In this
      method, the brain is divided into several different brain regions, and the EEG
      signals of different brain regions are transformed into several multispectral
      images by combining with the multispectral image transformation method. Using
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) classification algorithm, the depth residual network
      model pre-trained in ImageNet was transferred to sMRI data set for fine
      adjustment, instead of training a brand-new model from scratch. The results show 
      that the proposed method solves the problem of few available medical image
      samples and shortens the training time of ANN model.

TI  - Ventricular volume in relation to lumbar CSF levels of amyloid-beta 1-42, tau and
      phosphorylated tau in iNPH, is there a dilution effect?
PG  - 59
LID - 10.1186/s12987-022-00353-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Levels of the biomarkers amyloid-beta 1-42 (Abeta42), tau and
      phosphorylated tau (p-tau) are decreased in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of
      patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH). The mechanism
      behind this is unknown, but one potential explanation is dilution by excessive
      CSF volumes. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of a dilution 
      effect, by studying the relationship between ventricular volume (VV) and the
      levels of the CSF biomarkers. METHODS: In this cross-sectional observational
      study, preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and lumbar CSF was acquired 
      from 136 patients with a median age of 76 years, 89 men and 47 females, selected 
      for surgical treatment for iNPH. The CSF volume of the lateral and third
      ventricles was segmented on MRI and related to preoperative concentrations of
      Abeta42, tau and p-tau. RESULTS: In the total sample VV (Median 140.7 mL)
      correlated weakly (rs = - 0.17) with Abeta42 (Median 534 pg/mL), but not with tau
      (Median 216 pg/mL) nor p-tau (Median 31 pg/mL). In a subgroup analysis, the
      correlation between VV and Abeta42 was only present in the male group (rs = -
      0.22, p = 0.038). Further, Abeta42 correlated positively with tau (rs = 0.30, p =
      0.004) and p-tau (rs = 0.26, p = 0.012) in males but not in females. CONCLUSIONS:
      The findings did not support a major dilution effect in iNPH, at least not in
      females. The only result in favor for dilution was a weak negative correlation
      between VV and Abeta42 but not with the other lumbar CSF biomarkers. The
      different results between males and females suggest that future investigations of
      the CSF pattern in iNPH would gain from sex-based subgroup analysis.

TI  - Brain function complexity during dual-tasking is associated with cognitive
      impairment and age.
LID - 10.1111/jon.13025 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Early diagnosis of cognitive impairment is important
      because symptoms can be delayed through therapies. Synaptic disconnections are
      the key characteristics of dementia, and through nonlinear complexity analysis of
      brain function, it is possible to identify long-range synaptic disconnections in 
      the brain. METHODS: We investigated the capability of a novel upper-extremity
      function (UEF) dual-task paradigm in the functional MRI (fMRI) setting, where the
      participant flexes and extends their arm while counting, to differentiate between
      cognitively normal (CN) and those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We used
      multiscale entropy (MSE) complexity analysis of the blood oxygen-level dependent 
      time-series across neural networks and brain regions. Outside of the fMRI, we
      used the UEF dual-task test, while the elbow kinematics were measured using
      motion sensors, to record the motor function score. RESULTS: Results showed 34%
      lower MSE values in MCI compared to CN (p<.04 for all regions and networks except
      cerebellum when counting down by one; effect size = 1.35+/-0.15) and a negative
      correlation between MSE values and age (average r(2) of 0.30 for counting down by
      one and 0.36 for counting backward by three). Results also showed an improvement 
      in the logistic regression model sensitivity by 14-24% in predicting the presence
      of MCI when brain function measure was added to the motor function score
      (kinematics data). CONCLUSIONS: Current findings suggest that combining measures 
      of neural network and motor function, in addition to neuropsychological testing, 
      may provide an accurate tool for assessing early-stage cognitive impairment and
      age-related decline in cognition.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with growing
      major health impacts, particularly in countries with aging populations. The
      examination of neural circuit mechanisms in AD mouse models is a recent focus for
      identifying new AD treatment strategies. We hypothesize that age-progressive
      changes of both long-range and local hippocampal neural circuit connectivity
      occur in AD. Recent advancements in viral-genetic technologies provide new
      opportunities for semi-quantitative mapping of cell-type-specific neural circuit 
      connections in AD mouse models. We applied a recently developed monosynaptic
      rabies tracing method to hippocampal neural circuit mapping studies in AD model
      mice to determine how local and global circuit connectivity to hippocampal CA1
      excitatory neurons may be altered in the single amyloid precursor protein
      knock-in (APP-KI) AD mouse model. To determine age-related AD progression, we
      measured circuit connectivity in age-matched littermate control and AD model mice
      at two different ages (3-4 vs. 10-11months old). We semi-quantitatively mapped
      the connectivity strengths of neural circuit inputs to hippocampal CA1 excitatory
      neurons from brain regions including hippocampal subregions, medial septum,
      subiculum and entorhinal cortex, comparing different age groups and genotypes. We
      focused on this brain region because of its clear relationship with learning and 
      memory and that the hippocampal formation shows clear neuropathological changes
      in human AD. Our results reveal alterations in circuit connectivity of
      hippocampal CA1 in AD model mice. Overall, we find weaker extrinsic connectivity 
      CA1 input strengths in AD model mice compared with control mice, including sex
      differences of reduced subiculum to CA1 inputs in aged female AD mice compared to
      aged male AD mice. Unexpectedly, we find a connectivity pattern shift with an
      increased proportion of inputs from the CA3 region to CA1 excitatory neurons when
      comparing young and old AD model mice, as well as old wild-type mice and old AD
      model mice. These unexpected shifts in CA3-CA1 input proportions in this AD mouse
      model suggest the possibility that compensatory circuit increases may occur in
      response to connectivity losses in other parts of the hippocampal circuits. We
      expect that this work provides new insights into the neural circuit mechanisms of
      AD pathogenesis.

AB  - Resveratrol (RES) is a polyphenol with diverse beneficial pharmacological
      activities, and our previous results have demonstrated its neuroprotective
      potential. The purpose of this study was to investigate the therapeutic effect of
      RES in Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like behavioral dysfunction induced by
      streptozotocin (STZ) and explore it's potential mechanism of action. STZ was
      microinjected bilaterally into the dorsal hippocampus of C57BL/6J mice at a dose 
      of 3 mg/kg, and RES was administered intragastrically at a dose of 25 mg/kg for 5
      weeks. Neurobehavioral performance was observed, and serum concentrations of
      insulin and Nesfatin-1 were measured. Moreover, the protein expression of amyloid
      beta 1-42 (Abeta1-42), Tau, phosphorylated Tau (p-Tau) (Ser396), synaptic ras
      GTPase activation protein (SynGAP), postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95),
      synapsin-1, synaptogomin-1, and key molecules of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling
      pathway in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) were assessed. Finally,
      pathological damage to hippocampal tissue was examined by Nissl and
      immunofluorescence staining. The results showed that compared with the controls, 
      bilateral hippocampal microinjections of STZ induced task-specific learning and
      memory impairments, as indicated by the disadvantaged performances in the novel
      object recognition test (NOR) and Morris water maze (MWM), but not the contextual
      fear conditioning test (CFC). Treatment with RES could improve these behavioral
      disadvantages. The serum concentrations of insulin and Nesfatin-1 in the model
      group were remarkably higher than those of the control group. In addition,
      protein expression of Abeta1-42, Tau, and p-Tau (Ser396) was increased but
      expression of SynGAP, PSD95, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and
      p-GSK-3beta/GSK-3beta were decreased in the hippocampus. Although the protein
      expression of BDNF and SynGAP was also markedly decreased in the PFC of the model
      mice, there was no significant difference among groups in the protein expression 
      of PSD95, BDNF, synapsin-1, synaptogomin-1, and p-GSK-3beta/GSK-3beta. RES (25
      mg/kg) reversed the enhanced insulin level, the abnormal protein expression of
      Abeta1-42, Tau, and p-Tau (Ser396) in the hippocampus and PFC, and the
      hippocampal protein expression of SynGAP, PSD95 and BDNF. In addition, RES
      reversed the STZ-induced decrease in the number of Nissl bodies and the increase 
      in fluorescence intensity of IBA1 in the hippocampal CA1 region. These findings
      indicate that RES could ameliorate STZ-induced AD-like neuropathological
      injuries, the mechanism of which could be partly related to its regulation of
      BDNF expression and synaptic plasticity-associated proteins in the hippocampus.

AB  - PURPOSE: An association between frailty and vascular brain damage (VBD) has been 
      described in older adults. However, most studies have identified frailty
      according to the phenotypic model. It is less clear whether frailty,
      operationalized as an accumulation of health deficits, is associated with the
      presence and severity of VBD. The present study was therefore undertaken to
      verify whether a 50-item frailty index (FI) is related to VBD in a large and
      relatively unselected cohort of attendees of a memory clinic. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: The TREDEM (Treviso Dementia) registry includes retrospective
      observational data of 1584 participants. A modified FI was calculated from 50
      variables comprising diseases, disability, behavioral disorders, and blood
      biochemistry. The presence and severity of VBD, including leukoaraiosis, lacunes,
      larger infarctions and the hierarchical vascular rating scale (HVRS), were
      determined based on brain computerized tomography imaging. Multiple logistic
      regression models were built according to the stepwise method. RESULTS: Mean age 
      of the 1584 participants was 79.6 +/- 7.5 years and 1033 (65.2 %) were females.
      The average number of health deficits was 11.6 +/- 6.2, corresponding to an FI of
      0.23 +/- 0.12 (range: 0.00-0.56). Each 0.01-point increase in the FI was
      associated with an increased probability of leukoaraiosis (+2.3 %) and severe
      leukoaraiosis (+5 %), lacunas in the basal ganglia (+1.73 %), occipital lobes
      (+2.7 %), parietal lobes (+3 %), frontal lobes (+3.6 %), temporal lobes (+4.2 %),
      and thalamus (+4.4 %). Moreover, an increase of 0.01 points in the FI was
      associated with a 3.1 % increase in the probability of HVRS score (>/=2).
      CONCLUSION: An FI based on routine clinical and laboratory variables was
      associated with the presence, degree, and some localizations of VBD in a
      population of older adults with cognitive decline. This frailty assessment tool
      may therefore be used to identify individuals at risk of developing
      cerebrovascular disease and, consequently, to implement strategies for vascular
      risk factor control.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: There is a shred of growing evidence demonstrating that diabetic
      patients are at higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease compared to the
      general population. The previous investigation showed the protective effect of
      metformin for delaying dementia in diabetic patients. However, there are limited 
      data on the effect of metformin on structural changes. This study aims to
      investigate the effect of metformin on hippocampal and cortical volumes in
      non-demented diabetic individuals. METHOD: We entered 157 non-demented diabetic
      subjects including 89 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 68 cognitively healthy
      individuals from Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) which were
      then categorized as metformin users and non-users. We used the ANCOVA model for
      measuring the association between metformin use and hippocampal and cortical
      volumes. RESULTS: Among 157 subjects with a mean age of 71.8 (+/-7.7) included in
      this study, 76 individuals were stratified as metformin users. Results of the
      univariate model indicate that metformin users had a higher right (p = 0.003) and
      left parietal lobe volume (p = 0.004). Moreover, the volume of left cingulate was
      higher in those who used metformin compared to those not used it (p = 0.027). Our
      results were also significant for the right frontal lobe and indicated that
      metformin users had higher volume (p = 0.035). There were no significant
      differences in the hippocampus, occipital, and temporal regions. CONCLUSION: Our 
      findings showed the protective effects of metformin on brain volumes in
      non-demented elderly individuals with diabetes. Comparing the groups show strong 
      enough results regarding the lower atrophy in metformin users.

AB  - Aluminium is a metal known to cause neurotoxicity in the brain, by promoting
      neurodegeneration and affecting memory and cognitive ability. AlCl3 has been
      reported to enhance reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory markers which 
      are further responsible for the degeneration of neurons. AlCl3 exposure to
      zebrafish causes behavioral, biochemical, and neurochemical changes in the brain.
      In our study, Zebrafish were exposed to AlCl3 at three different doses (50
      microg/L, 100 microg/L, and 200 microg/L) for four consecutive days. On days 1st 
      and 4th, a novel diving test was performed to check anxiety in zebrafish. T -
      maze and novel object recognition test were used to check the memory on days 3rd 
      and 4th with the help of ANY-maze software. On the last day (4th day),
      zebrafishes were sacrificed and whole brains were used to perform the
      biochemical, neurotransmitters, histopathological, and immunohistochemistry
      analysis. Our study revealed that AlCl3 exposure significantly decreased the
      total distance traveled, and the number of entries in the top zone and increased 
      the time spent in the bottom zone, checked through the novel diving test. In the 
      T maze test, AlCl3 treated zebrafish showed significantly increased transfer
      latency to the favorable zone and time spent, and the number of entries to the
      unfavorable zone. The exploration time with the novel object was reduced
      significantly after AlCl3 treatment. Moreover, reduced glutathione (GSH) and
      superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels were significantly reduced in AlCl3 treated
      zebrafish whereas malondialdehyde (MDA) level was found to be increased,
      indicating high oxidative stress. The neurotransmitters level was also disturbed 
      indicated by the significantly decreased GABA, dopamine, noradrenaline, and
      Serotonin levels and increased glutamate level in the brain of zebrafish treated 
      with AlCl3. Moreover, histopathological and immunohistochemistry study shows a
      markedly increased number of pyknotic neurons and reduced the expression of Nrf2 
      in the zebrafish brain after AlCl3 exposure. These findings suggest that AlCl3
      significantly causes behavioral, biochemical, neurotransmitters, morphological,
      and molecular changes in zebrafish, ultimately causing AD.

AB  - Vascular risk factors such as hyperglycemia and platelet hyperactivation play a
      significant role in type 2 diabetes (T2D), a risk factor for AD. We investigated 
      the relationships between glycemia levels, platelet indices (platelet count; mean
      platelet volume (MPV)) and AD neuroimaging markers in 105 cognitively unimpaired 
      adults, including 21 amyloid-negative older adults (Abeta-neg controls), and 45
      amyloid-positive patients with mild cognitive impairment or dementia (Abeta-pos
      patients). We assessed between-group differences on the two T2D-related vascular 
      risk factors, then the association between blood parameters and multimodal
      neuroimaging (structural MRI, (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose, and
      (18)F-florbetapir-PET) in cognitively unimpaired adults and Abeta-pos patients
      using multiple regressions. Compared to Abeta-neg controls, Abeta-pos patients
      showed lower platelet count and higher MPV. In cognitively unimpaired adults,
      increased glycemia levels were associated with atrophy and hypometabolism in
      AD-sensitive regions. In Abeta-pos patients, increased MPV was associated with
      entorhinal and perirhinal cortex atrophy. Subclinical but high glycemia levels in
      healthy individuals and MPV in AD patients are associated with neurodegeneration 
      in AD-sensitive brain regions but not with amyloid deposition.

AB  - Female APOE4 carriers are at greatest risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The
      potent estrogen 17beta-estradiol (E2) may mediate AD risk, as the onset of memory
      decline coincides with the menopausal transition. Whether APOE genotype mediates 
      E2's effects on memory and neuronal morphology is poorly understood. We used the 
      APOE(+/+)/5xFAD(+/-) (EFAD) mouse model to examine how APOE3 homozygote (E3FAD), 
      APOE3/4 heterozygote (E3/4FAD), and APOE4 homozygote (E4FAD) genotypes modulate
      effects of E2 on object and spatial memory consolidation, dendritic spine
      density, and dorsal hippocampal estrogen receptor expression in 6-month-old
      ovariectomized EFAD mice. Dorsal hippocampal E2 infusion enhanced memory
      consolidation and increased CA1 apical spine density in E3FAD and E3/4FAD, but
      not E4FAD, mice. CA1 basal mushroom spines were also increased by E2 in E3FADs.
      E4FAD mice exhibited reduced CA1 and mPFC basal spine density, and increased
      dorsal hippocampal ERalpha protein, independent of E2. Overall, E2 benefitted
      hippocampal memory and structural plasticity in females bearing one or no APOE4
      allele, whereas two APOE4 alleles impeded the memory-enhancing and spinogenic
      effects of E2.

AB  - We evaluated the effect of Acetyl-cholinesterase-inhibitors (AChEIs) on cognitive
      decline and overall survival in a large sample of older patients with late onset 
      Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), vascular dementia (VD) or Lewy body disease (LBD)
      from a real world setting. Patients with dementia enrolled between 2005 and 2020 
      by the "Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers" were analysed; the mean follow-up
      period was 7.9 years. A 1:1 propensity score matching was performed generating a 
      cohort of 1.572 patients (786 treated [AChEIs +] and 786 not treated [AChEIs-]
      with AChEIs. The MMSE score was almost stable during the first 6 years of follow 
      up in AChEIs + and then declined, while in AChEIs- it progressively declined so
      that at the end of follow-up (13.6 years) the average decrease in MMSE was 10.8
      points in AChEIs- compared with 5.4 points in AChEIs + (p < 0.001). This trend
      was driven by LOAD (Delta-MMSE:-10.8 vs. -5.7 points; p < 0.001), although a
      similar effect was observed in VD (Delta-MMSE:-11.6 vs. -8.8; p < 0.001). No
      effect on cognitive status was found in LBD. At multivariate Cox regression
      analysis (adjusted for age, gender, dependency level and depression) a strong
      association between AChEIs therapy and lower all-cause mortality was observed
      (H.R.:0.59; 95%CI: 0.53-0.66); this was confirmed also in analyses separately
      conducted in LOAD, VD and LBD. Among older people with dementia, treatment with
      AChEIs was associated with a slower cognitive decline and with reduced mortality,
      after a mean follow-up of almost eight years. Our data support the effectiveness 
      of AChEIs in older patients affected by these types of dementia.

AB  - Over the years, the scientific community has sought improvements in the life
      quality of patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Synaptic loss and
      neuronal death observed in the regions responsible for cognitive functions
      represent an irreversible progressive disease that is clinically characterized by
      impaired cognitive and functional abilities, along with behavioral symptoms.
      Currently, image and body fluid biomarkers can provide early dementia diagnostic,
      being it the best way to slow the disease's progression. The first signs of AD
      development are still complex, the existence of individual genetic and phenotypic
      characteristics about the disease makes it difficult to standardize studies on
      the subject. The answer seems to be related between Abeta and tau proteins. Abeta
      deposition in the medial parietal cortex appears to be the initial stage of AD,
      but it does not have a strong correlation with neurodegeneration. The strongest
      link between symptoms occurs with tau aggregation, which antecede Abeta deposits 
      in the medial temporal lobe, however, the protein can be found in cognitively
      healthy older people. The answer to the question may lie in some catalytic effect
      between both proteins. Amid so many doubts, Aducanumab was approved, which raised
      controversies and results intense debate in the scientific field. Abnormal
      singling of some blood biomarkers produced by adipocytes under high lipogenesis, 
      such as TNFalpha, leptin, and interleukin-6, demonstrate to be linked to
      neuroinflammation worsens, diabetes, and also severe cases of COVID-19,
      howsoever, under higher lipolysis, seem to have therapeutic anti-inflammatory
      effects in the brain, which has increasingly contributed to the understanding of 
      AD. In addition, the relationship of severe clinical complications caused by
      Sars-CoV-2 viral infection and AD, go beyond the term "risk group" and may be
      related to the development of dementia long-term. Thus, this review summarized
      the current emerging pharmacotherapies, alternative treatments, and
      nanotechnology applied in clinical trials, discussing relevant points that may
      contribute to a more accurate look.

TI  - The Boston criteria version 2.0 for cerebral amyloid angiopathy: a multicentre,
      retrospective, MRI-neuropathology diagnostic accuracy study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is an age-related small vessel
      disease, characterised pathologically by progressive deposition of amyloid beta
      in the cerebrovascular wall. The Boston criteria are used worldwide for the
      in-vivo diagnosis of CAA but have not been updated since 2010, before the
      emergence of additional MRI markers. We report an international collaborative
      study aiming to update and externally validate the Boston diagnostic criteria
      across the full spectrum of clinical CAA presentations. METHODS: In this
      multicentre, hospital-based, retrospective, MRI and neuropathology diagnostic
      accuracy study, we did a retrospective analysis of clinical, radiological, and
      histopathological data available to sites participating in the International CAA 
      Association to formulate updated Boston criteria and establish their diagnostic
      accuracy across different populations and clinical presentations. Ten North
      American and European academic medical centres identified patients aged 50 years 
      and older with potential CAA-related clinical presentations (ie, spontaneous
      intracerebral haemorrhage, cognitive impairment, or transient focal neurological 
      episodes), available brain MRI, and histopathological assessment for CAA
      diagnosis. MRI scans were centrally rated at Massachusetts General Hospital
      (Boston, MA, USA) for haemorrhagic and non-haemorrhagic CAA markers, and brain
      tissue samples were rated by neuropathologists at the contributing sites. We
      derived the Boston criteria version 2.0 (v2.0) by selecting MRI features to
      optimise diagnostic specificity and sensitivity in a prespecified derivation
      cohort (Boston cases 1994-2012, n=159), then externally validated the criteria in
      a prespecified temporal validation cohort (Boston cases 2012-18, n=59) and a
      geographical validation cohort (non-Boston cases 2004-18; n=123), comparing
      accuracy of the new criteria to the currently used modified Boston criteria with 
      histopathological assessment of CAA as the diagnostic standard. We also assessed 
      performance of the v2.0 criteria in patients across all cohorts who had the
      diagnostic gold standard of brain autopsy. FINDINGS: The study protocol was
      finalised on Jan 15, 2017, patient identification was completed on Dec 31, 2018, 
      and imaging analyses were completed on Sept 30, 2019. Of 401 potentially eligible
      patients presenting to Massachusetts General Hospital, 218 were eligible to be
      included in the analysis; of 160 patient datasets from other centres, 123 were
      included. Using the derivation cohort, we derived provisional criteria for
      probable CAA requiring the presence of at least two strictly lobar haemorrhagic
      lesions (ie, intracerebral haemorrhages, cerebral microbleeds, or foci of
      cortical superficial siderosis) or at least one strictly lobar haemorrhagic
      lesion and at least one white matter characteristic (ie, severe visible
      perivascular spaces in centrum semiovale or white matter hyperintensities in a
      multispot pattern). The sensitivity and specificity of these criteria were 74.8% 
      (95% CI 65.4-82.7) and 84.6% (71.9-93.1) in the derivation cohort, 92.5%
      (79.6-98.4) and 89.5% (66.9-98.7) in the temporal validation cohort, 80.2%
      (70.8-87.6) and 81.5% (61.9-93.7) in the geographical validation cohort, and
      74.5% (65.4-82.4) and 95.0% (83.1-99.4) in all patients who had autopsy as the
      diagnostic standard. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
      (AUC) was 0.797 (0.732-0.861) in the derivation cohort, 0.910 (0.828-0.992) in
      the temporal validation cohort, 0.808 (0.724-0.893) in the geographical
      validation cohort, and 0.848 (0.794-0.901) in patients who had autopsy as the
      diagnostic standard. The v2.0 Boston criteria for probable CAA had superior
      accuracy to the current Boston criteria (sensitivity 64.5% [54.9-73.4];
      specificity 95.0% [83.1-99.4]; AUC 0.798 [0.741-0854]; p=0.0005 for comparison of
      AUC) across all individuals who had autopsy as the diagnostic standard.
      INTERPRETATION: The Boston criteria v2.0 incorporate emerging MRI markers of CAA 
      to enhance sensitivity without compromising their specificity in our cohorts of
      patients aged 50 years and older presenting with spontaneous intracerebral
      haemorrhage, cognitive impairment, or transient focal neurological episodes.
      Future studies will be needed to determine generalisability of the v.2.0 criteria
      across the full range of patients and clinical presentations. FUNDING: US

AB  - The amyloid cascade is the most frequently accepted hypothesis of Alzheimer's
      Disease (AD). According to this hypothesis, the formation of plaques precedes the
      appearance of fibrillary tangles. Therapeutic agents able to inhibit the
      formation of plaques are therefore considered as potential disease-modifying
      treatments (DMT) that could prevent or limit the progression of AD. Plaques are
      deposits formed by aggregates of amyloid-beta (Abeta)-peptides. These peptides
      are metabolites of amyloid precursor protein (APP) first mediated by two enzymes:
      beta-secretase 1 (BACE1) and gamma-secretase. Molecular identification of these
      two enzymes has stimulated the development of their inhibitors. The clinical
      testing of these two classes of molecules has not been successful to date. The
      oligomerization of Abeta-peptides into plaques is now targeted by immunological
      approaches such as antibodies and vaccines. Structural consideration of the
      Abeta-peptide sequence led to the launch of the antibody Aducanumab. Several
      other antibodies are in late clinical phases. Progress in the understanding of
      the effects of N-truncated Abeta-peptides such as pE3-42, formed by the action of
      recently well characterized enzymes (aminopeptidase A, dipeptidylpeptidase-4 and 
      glutaminyl cyclase) suggests that oligomerization can be limited either by enzyme
      inhibitors or antibody approaches. This strategy associating two structurally
      interconnected mechanisms is focused in this review.

TI  - Dementia prevention: The potential long-term cost-effectiveness of the FINGER
      prevention program.
LID - 10.1002/alz.12698 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to estimate the potential
      cost-effectiveness of the Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent
      Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER) program. METHODS: A life-time Markov
      model with societal perspective, simulating a cohort of people at risk of
      dementia reflecting usual care and the FINGER program. RESULTS: Costs were
      1,653,275 and 1,635,346 SEK and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were 8.636
      and 8.679 for usual care and the FINGER program, respectively, resulting in
      savings of 16,928 SEK (2023 US$) and 0.043 QALY gains per person, supporting
      extended dominance for the FINGER program. A total of 1623 dementia cases were
      avoided with 0.17 fewer person-years living with dementia. The sensitivity
      analysis confirmed the conclusions in most scenarios. DISCUSSION: The model
      provides support that programs like FINGER have the potential to be
      cost-effective in preventing dementia. Results at the individual level are rather
      modest, but the societal benefits can be substantial because of the large
      potential target population.

AB  - Improving the prevention, detection, and treatment of Alzheimer's disease and
      Alzheimer's disease related dementias (AD/ADRD) across racial, ethnic, and other 
      diverse populations is a national priority. To this end, this paper proposes the 
      development of the Standard Health Record for Dementia (SHRD, pronounced
      "shared") for collecting and sharing AD/ADRD real-world data (RWD). SHRD would
      replace the current unstandardized, fragmented, or missing state of key RWD with 
      an open source, consensus-based, and interoperable common data standard. This
      paper describes how SHRD could leverage the best practices of the Minimal Common 
      Oncology Data Elements (mCODETM) initiative to advance prevention, detection, and
      treatment; gain adoption by clinicians and electronic health record (EHR)
      vendors; and establish sustainable business and governance models. It describes a
      range of potential use cases to advance equity, including strengthening public
      health surveillance by facilitating AD/ADRD registry reporting; improving case
      detection and staging; and diversifying participation in clinical trials.

      Implications for Understanding the Value of Future Interventions.

AB  - Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. Recent thinking
      portrays AD as a continuum consisting of three stages: an asymptomatic
      preclinical period, a mild cognitive impairment phase, and dementia, which can be
      further classified as mild, moderate or severe. While many studies explore the
      cognitive and functional aspects of AD, fully understanding AD pathophysiology,
      as well as the potential value of pharmacological and psycho-social
      interventions, requires a deeper understanding of patient and care partner
      priorities, particularly in the early stages where such interventions may have
      the greatest impact in slowing or delaying progression. Available studies
      highlight a diverse range of patient and care partner priorities, including
      impacts on their emotions, moods, and social lives. These priorities have not
      been systematically incorporated in the clinical and value assessments of
      potential interventions. We propose approaches to better understand the
      humanistic impact of AD including conducting additional research into the impacts
      of interventions from the point of view of patients and care partners, expanding 
      notions of 'value' and improving health system capacity for diagnosis.

AB  - New therapies that address the underlying pathophysiology of Alzheimer's Disease 
      (AD), coupled with the growth of the AD population, will transform the AD care
      pathway and present significant challenges to health systems. We explored
      real-world challenges health systems may face in delivering potential new AD
      therapies with diverse stakeholders. Key challenges in care included integrating 
      primary care providers into assessment and management, availability of memory
      care specialists, understanding payment and coverage issues and training
      mid-level providers to help coordinate care and serve as a shared resource across
      the system. This input informed a novel Site Readiness Framework for AD,
      comprising self-assessment exercises to identify health system capabilities and
      gaps and a framework of core strategies and responsive tools to help prepare to
      integrate new AD therapies. These resources may help health systems improve
      readiness to modify care pathways to integrate new therapies for AD.

AB  - The underlying processes occurring in aging are complex, involving numerous
      biological changes that result in chronic cellular stress and sterile
      inflammation. One of the main hallmarks of aging is senescence. While originally 
      the term senescence was defined in the field of oncology, further research has
      established that also microglia, astrocytes and neurons become senescent. Since
      age is the main risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases, it is reasonable to
      argue that cellular senescence might play a major role in Alzheimer's disease.
      Specific cellular changes seen during Alzheimer's disease are similar to those
      observed during senescence across all resident brain cell types. Furthermore,
      increased levels of senescence-associated secretory phenotype proteins such as
      IL-6, IGFBP, TGF-beta and MMP-10 have been found in both CSF and plasma samples
      from Alzheimer's disease patients. In addition, genome-wide association studies
      have identified that individuals with Alzheimer's disease carry a high burden of 
      genetic risk variants in genes known to be involved in senescence, including
      ADAM10, ADAMTS4, and BIN1. Thus, cellular senescence is emerging as a potential
      underlying disease process operating in Alzheimer's disease. This has also
      attracted more attention to exploiting cellular senescence as a therapeutic
      target. Several senolytic compounds with the capability to eliminate senescent
      cells have been examined in vivo and in vitro with notable results, suggesting
      they may provide a novel therapeutic avenue. Here, we reviewed the current
      knowledge of cellular senescence and discussed the evidence of senescence in
      various brain cell types and its putative role in inflammaging and
      neurodegenerative processes.

AB  - As the focus of Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapeutic development shifts to the
      early stages of the disease, the clinical endpoints used in drug trials, and how 
      these might translate into clinical practice, are of increasing importance. The
      clinical meaningfulness of trial outcome measures is often unclear, with a lack
      of conclusive evidence as to how these measures correlate to changes in disease
      progression and treatment response. Clarifying this would benefit all, including 
      patients, care partners, primary care providers, regulators, and payers, and
      would enhance our understanding of the relationship between clinical trial
      endpoints and assessments used in everyday practice. At present, there is a wide 
      range of assessment tools used in clinical trials for AD and substantial
      variability in measures selected as endpoints across these trials. The aim of
      this review is to summarize the most commonly used assessment tools for early
      stages of AD, describe their use in clinical trials and clinical practice, and
      discuss what might constitute clinically meaningful change in these measures in
      relation to disease progression and treatment response.

TI  - Elecsys Cerebrospinal Fluid Assays Accurately Distinguish Alzheimer's Disease
      from Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration.
PG  - 491-498
LID - 10.14283/jpad.2022.27 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD)
      are heterogeneous in their clinical presentation and underlying pathology, but
      they often have overlapping features. Diagnostic accuracy is critical for guiding
      patient management. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diagnostic assays for the
      differentiation of AD and FTLD may increase diagnostic accuracy. OBJECTIVES: In
      this study, we aimed to understand the potential role of CSF biomarkers and
      biomarker ratios, measured using Elecsys(R) CSF immunoassays (Roche Diagnostics
      International Ltd, Rotkreuz, Switzerland), in the differential diagnosis of AD
      and FTLD. DESIGN: This study was conducted at a single center in Munich, Germany 
      between July 2019 and July 2020. Patient CSF samples were retrospectively
      collected from the study center biobank. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 130 patients
      with cognitive impairment were included in the study; 86 patients were diagnosed 
      with AD and 44 with FTLD (behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, semantic
      variant of primary progressive aphasia, and non-fluent variant of primary
      progressive aphasia), based on core clinical criteria and a non-CSF biomarker, a 
      typical pattern of regional hypometabolism on [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose positron
      emission tomography. MEASUREMENTS: Patient CSF biomarker concentrations were
      measured using Elecsys CSF immunoassays. Receiver operating characteristic
      analyses were conducted to determine areas under the curve (AUCs) for CSF
      biomarker performance. Sensitivity and specificity analyses were conducted to
      evaluate the performance of established cut-offs (Abeta42 </=1000 pg/mL,
      pTau181/Abeta42 ratio >0.024, and tTau/Abeta42 ratio >0.28) and optimized
      cut-offs based on Youden's index. RESULTS: AUC-based performance was similarly
      good for the pTau181/Abeta42 ratio (AUC=0.841; 95% CI: 0.759-0.923),
      pTau181/Abeta40 ratio (AUC=0.837; 95% CI: 0.754-0.919), Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio
      (AUC=0.829; 95% CI: 0.746-0.912), tTau/Abeta42 ratio (AUC=0.822; 95% CI:
      0.736-0.908), pTau181/Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio (AUC=0.817; 95% CI: 0.734-0.901), and
      Abeta42 (AUC=0.812; 95% CI: 0.722-0.902). Performance was slightly lower for the 
      tTau/Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio (AUC=0.799; 95% CI: 0.713-0.885), pTau181 alone
      (AUC=0.793; 95% CI: 0.707-0.880), tTau/Abeta40 ratio (AUC=0.751; 95% CI:
      0.657-0.844), and tTau alone (AUC=0.706; 95% CI: 0.613-0.799). The highest
      qualitative performance was observed with the pTau181/Abeta42 ratio with an
      established cut-off value of >0.024 and optimized cut-off value of >0.022:
      sensitivity and specificity values were 0.892 and 0.773, respectively.
      CONCLUSIONS: Elecsys CSF immunoassays demonstrate good diagnostic accuracy in
      differentiating patients with AD from those with FTLD. These immunoassays have
      the potential to support clinical decision making, i.e. in diagnosing patients
      with FTLD by excluding patients with amyloid positivity, which is indicative of
      underlying AD.

TI  - Cerebral Phospho-Tau Acts Synergistically with Soluble Abeta42 Leading to Mild
      Cognitive Impairment in AAV-AD Rats.
PG  - 480-490
LID - 10.14283/jpad.2022.18 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a continuum of events beginning with an
      increase in brain soluble Abeta42 followed by the appearance of
      hyperphosphorylated tau (P-tau, asymptomatic stage). Mild Cognitive Impairment
      (MCI) then appears (prodromal stage). However, the individual contribution of
      these two soluble proteins in the onset of the first cognitive symptoms remains
      unclear. OBJECTIVES: We sought to understand the specific impact of p-tau on the 
      development of MCI in the AAV-AD rat model, a model of late-onset Alzheimer's
      disease (LOAD) predementia. METHODS: We specifically reduced the phosphorylation 
      level of tau while leaving Abeta42 levels unchanged using a DYRK1A protein kinase
      inhibitor, Leucettine L41, in an adeno-associated virus-based Alzheimer's disease
      (AAV-AD) rat model. Leucettine L41 was administered by intraperitoneal injection 
      at 20 mg/kg per day in AAV-AD rats from 9 (late asymptomatic phase) to 10
      (prodromal phase) months of age. RESULTS: Decreased soluble forms of P-tau
      induced by chronic administration of Leucettine L41 did not change soluble
      Abeta42 levels but prevented MCI onset in 10-month-old AAV-AD rats. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The present study argues that P-tau is required to induce the development of MCI.
      Consistent with our previous findings that soluble Abeta42 is also required for
      MCI onset, the data obtained in the AAV-AD rat model confirm that the transition 
      from the asymptomatic to the prodromal stage may be caused by the combined
      presence of both soluble brain forms of Abeta42 and p-tau, suggesting that the
      development of MCI may be the consequence of their synergistic action.

TI  - A Conformational Variant of p53 (U-p53AZ) as Blood-Based Biomarker for the
      Prediction of the Onset of Symptomatic Alzheimer's Disease.
PG  - 469-479
LID - 10.14283/jpad.2022.52 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ongoing research seeks to identify blood-based biomarkers able to
      predict onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). OBJECTIVE: The
      unfolded conformational variant of p53 (U-p53AZ), previously observed in AD
      individuals, was evaluated in plasma samples from individuals participating in
      the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) cohort for diagnostic and
      prognostic assessment, validated on a neuropsychological-based diagnosis, over
      the course of six years. DESIGN: Retrospective Longitudinal Prognostic biomarker 
      study. SETTING: Single-center study based on the AIBL cohort. PARTICIPANTS: 482
      participants of the AIBL cohort, aged 60-85 years, without uncontrolled diabetes,
      vascular disease, severe depression or psychiatric illnesses. MEASUREMENTS: The
      AlzoSure(R) Predict test, consisting of immunoprecipitation (IP) followed by
      liquid chromatography (LC) tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), was performed to
      quantify the AZ 284(R) peptide as readout of U-p53AZ and compared with an
      independent neuropsychological diagnosis. The amyloid load via amyloid
      beta-positron emission tomography (Abeta-PET) and supporting clinical information
      were included where possible. RESULTS: U-p53AZ diagnostic and prognostic
      performance was assessed in both time-independent and time-dependent (36, 72 and 
      90 months following initial sampling) analyses. Prognostic performance of
      Abeta-PET and survival analyses with different risk factors (gender, Abeta-PET
      and APOE epsilon4 allele status) were also performed. U-p53AZ differentiated
      neuropsychologically graded AD from non-AD samples, and its detection at
      intermediate/high levels precisely identified present and future symptomatic AD. 
      In both time-independent and time-dependent prognostic analyses U-p53AZ achieved 
      area under the curve (AUC) >98%, significantly higher than Abeta-PET AUCs
      (between 84% and 93%, P respectively <0.0001 and <0.001). As single factor,
      U-p53AZ could clearly determine the risk of AD neuropsychological diagnosis over 
      time (low versus intermediate/high U-p53AZ hazard ratio=2.99). Proportional
      hazards regression analysis identified U-p53AZ levels as a major independent
      predictor of AD onset. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support use of U-p53AZ as
      blood-based biomarker predicting whether individuals would reach
      neuropsychologically-defined AD within six years prior to AD diagnosis.
      Integration of U-p53AZ in screening processes could support refined participant
      stratification for interventional studies.

LID - 10.14283/jpad.2022.26 [doi]
AB  - Prolonged exposure to environmental aluminum-containing substances is associated 
      with the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is a brain disorder
      associated with a gradual weakening in neurocognitive functions. Mesenchymal stem
      cells (MSCs) transplant as a promising and safe approach is used to treat AD
      through countless mechanisms. Therefore, this study aims to elucidate how MSCs
      improve biochemical and histopathological approaches associated with the AD model
      in rats. MSCs treatment restores the redox status impairment through a notable
      decline in the malondialdehyde (MDA) levels along with antioxidant enrichment.
      The anti-inflammatory effect of MSCs through conversion of microglial cells from 
      M1 to M2 and inhibition of pro-inflammatory mediator's release work in with
      de-activated GSK-3beta. Additionally, the alleviation of autophagy and lysosomal 
      clearance of Abeta and tau aggregates was accompanied by a down-regulation of the
      mTOR. Moreover, MSCs upregulate the expression of SIRT1 together with a limited
      expression of miR-134 thereby, improve neurite outgrowth and synaptic loss.
      Overall, the obtained data confirm the novelty of MSCs in the treatment of AD not
      only by their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory effect but also by restoring the
      neural integrity, neurogenesis, improving the neurocognitive function, and
      modulation of the signal pathways linked to the Abeta hypothesis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite reports on neuroprotective effects of dietary theobromine
      intake, whether dietary theobromine has beneficial effects on cognitive function 
      is unclear. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between dietary
      theobromine and cognitive function. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. SETTING:
      Data were collected from the 2011-2014 cycles of the National Health and
      Nutrition Examination Survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention of the USA. PARTICIPANTS: A representative American population aged
      >/=60 years. MEASUREMENTS: L-theobromine was treated as a log transform and
      dichotomous form (the highest quantile vs. others). Cognitive function was
      measured using four tests: Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's
      Disease Word Learning tests, Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's
      Disease delayed recall test, animal fluency test, and digit symbol substitution
      test. We conducted multiple regression analyses and subgroup analyses to study
      the association between theobromine and cognitive performance. Basic
      characteristics, lifestyle factors, disease history, and nutritional intake were 
      adjusted for in these models. RESULTS: A total of 2,845 participants were
      included in the study. The highest quantile of L-theobromine intake was
      positively associated with sores of delayed recall, animal fluency, and digit
      symbol substitution tests (beta, 95% confidence interval, P: 0.11, -0.00-0.30,
      0.049; 0.50, 0.02-0.99, 0.043; 1.55, 0.33-2.77, 0.015; respectively) in the fully
      adjusted model, but not with immediate recall score (beta=0.13, 95% confidence
      interval -0.16-0.43, P=0.361). Subgroup analyses showed that L-theobromine intake
      was associated with cognitive performance in the highest quantile of caffeine
      intake. CONCLUSIONS: Daily theobromine intake was associated with cognitive
      performance in a large nationally representative population. However, further
      research is needed to corroborate our findings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Varicose vein may be related to increased risk of comorbidities and
      decreased cognitive function in the elderly, but little is known about the
      association between varicose vein and Alzheimer's disease. OBJECTIVES: To
      evaluate whether there is an association between varicose veins and Alzheimer's
      disease. DESIGN: The study subjects of this cohort study were selected based on
      Chang Gung Research Database from January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2012.
      Follow-up ended December 31, 2017. SETTING: A population-based study
      Participants: Patients aged 45 years and older with varicose veins were enrolled,
      and the participants of control group were selected by matching with gender, age,
      and index date at a 4:1 ratio. MEASUREMENTS: The hazard ratios associated with
      varicose veins were estimated using Cox regression analysis with competitive risk
      model. Incidence rates of Alzheimer's disease, was assessed in people with and
      without varicose veins. RESULTS: A total of 9,601 patients with varicose veins
      and 38,404 matched controls were enrolled in the study. The varicose veins group 
      had higher incidence rates than the control group for Alzheimer's disease (12.60 
      vs 6.24 per 10,000 person-years; Hazard ratio, 1.647 [95% confidence interval,
      1.326- 2.045, p<0.001]). Patients with complicated varicose veins had increased
      incidence of Alzheimer's disease than uncomplicated cases (adjusted HR, 1.474;
      95% CI, 1.034-2.101, P=0.032). CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrated a
      positive association between the varicose veins and Alzheimer's disease.
      Physicians should be alerted to cognitive function in patients with varicose
      veins, especially those with presence of inflammation and ulcerations.

      History, Loneliness, and Personality.
PG  - 435-440
LID - 10.14283/jpad.2022.31 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: With the increasing focus on prevention of Alzheimer's disease, there
      is need for characterization of preclinical populations. Local participant
      registries offer an opportunity to facilitate research engagement via remote data
      collection, inform recruitment, and characterize preclinical samples, including
      individuals with subjective cognitive decline. OBJECTIVES: We sought to
      characterize subjective cognitive decline in a registry sample, as related to
      psychiatric history and related variables, including personality and loneliness, 
      quality of life, and factors related to dementia risk (e.g., family history of
      dementia). DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 366 individuals (mean
      age=67.2 (range 50-88), 65% female, 94% white, 97% non-Hispanic or Latino, 82%
      with at least a bachelor's degree) with no reported history of mild cognitive
      impairment or dementia. All participants had expressed interest in research,
      primarily via community outreach events and prior research involvement. Data was 
      collected via electronic surveys, distributed using REDCap. Electronic
      questionnaires included questions on demographic variables, subjective cognitive 
      decline, quality of life, loneliness, and personality. RESULTS: There was a high 
      prevalence of risk factors for dementia in the registry sample (68% with family
      history of dementia, 31% with subjective cognitive decline). Subjective cognitive
      decline was more common in women and associated with history of depression, but
      not with family history of dementia. Subjective cognitive decline was also
      associated with lower conscientiousness and lower emotional stability, as well as
      higher loneliness and lower quality of life. Among participants who endorsed a
      psychiatric history, most reported onset more than 10 years prior, rather than
      within the last 10 years. CONCLUSIONS: Subjective cognitive decline in a registry
      sample may be more strongly associated with longstanding psychiatric and
      personality variables, rather than family history of dementia, adding to the
      literature on characterization of subjective cognitive decline across different
      settings. These findings highlight the acceptability of remote data collection
      and the potential of registries to inform recruitment by characterizing
      registrants, which may help to stratify dementia risk and match participants to
      eligible trials.

LID - 10.14283/jpad.2022.38 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are currently no drug therapies modifying the natural history
      of patients suffering Alzheimer's disease (AD). Most recent clinical trials in
      the field include only subjects in early stage of the disease, while patients
      with advanced AD are usually not represented. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the
      feasibility, safety and efficacy of systemic infusions of adenosine triphosphate 
      (ATP) in patients with moderate to severe AD, and to select the minimum effective
      dose of infusion. DESIGN: A phase IIb, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled clinical trial investigates. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 20
      subjects with moderate or severe AD were included, 16 in the treatment group and 
      4 in the placebo group (4:1 randomization) at two dosage regimens, 6-hour or
      24-hour infusions. RESULTS: The proof-of-concept study was successfully
      conducted, with no significant deviations from the study protocol and no serious 
      adverse events reported. Regarding efficacy, only marginal differences were
      observed between ATP and placebo arms for H-MRS and MMSE variables. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our study demonstrates that the use of ATP infusion as therapy is feasible and
      safe. Larger studies are however needed to assess the efficacy of ATP in moderate
      to severe AD.

PG  - 410-424
LID - 10.14283/jpad.2022.40 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous meta-analyses did not explore the immediate and long-term
      effect of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) on different cognitive domains in
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). The meta-analysis aimed to assess the therapy effect of
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct
      current stimulation (tDCS) on different cognitive domains in AD in randomized
      controlled trials (RCTs). METHODS: Studies published before December 2021 and
      exploring therapy effect of rTMS, tDCS on different cognitive domains in AD were 
      searched in the following databases: PubMed and Web of Science. We used STATA
      12.0 software to compute the standard mean difference (SMD) and a 95% confidence 
      interval (CI). RESULTS: The present study included 16 articles (including 372 AD 
      patients treated with rTMS and 310 treated with sham rTMS) for rTMS and 11
      articles (including 152 AD patients treated with tDCS and 134 treated with sham
      tDCS) for tDCS. The present study showed better immediate and long-term general
      cognitive function increase effects in AD given rTMS, compared to those given
      sham rTMS with random effects models (immediate effect: SMD = 2.07, 95% CI = 0.37
      to 3.77, I2 = 97.8%, p < 0.001; long-term effect: SMD = 5.04, 95% CI = 2.25 to
      7.84, I2 = 97.8%, p < 0.001). The present study showed no significant immediate
      and long-term effects of rTMS on attention, executive, language and memory
      functions. In addition, the present study showed no significant difference in
      immediate or long-term effects of tDCS on general cognitive function, attention, 
      language or memory functions between tDCS group and sham tDCS group. CONCLUSIONS:
      RTMS was an effective treatment technique for general cognitive function in AD,
      whereas tDCS showed no significant therapy effect on cognitive function in AD.
      More large-scale studies were essential to explore the effect of NIBS on various 
      cognitive function in AD.

      Trials.
PG  - 400-409
LID - 10.14283/jpad.2022.49 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A key issue to Alzheimer's disease clinical trial failures is poor
      participant selection. Participants have heterogeneous cognitive trajectories and
      many do not decline during trials, which reduces a study's power to detect
      treatment effects. Trials need enrichment strategies to enroll individuals who
      are more likely to decline. OBJECTIVES: To develop machine learning models to
      predict cognitive trajectories in participants with early Alzheimer's disease and
      presymptomatic individuals over 24 and 48 months respectively. DESIGN: Prognostic
      machine learning models were trained from a combination of demographics,
      cognitive tests, APOE genotype, and brain imaging data. SETTING: Data from the
      Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), National Alzheimer's
      Coordinating Center (NACC), Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-3),
      PharmaCog, and a Phase 3 clinical trial in early Alzheimer's disease were used
      for this study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2098 participants who had demographics, 
      cognitive tests, APOE genotype, and brain imaging data, as well as follow-up
      visits for 24-48 months were included. MEASUREMENTS: Baseline magnetic resonance 
      imaging, cognitive tests, demographics, and APOE genotype were used to separate
      decliners, defined as individuals whose CDR-Sum of Boxes scores increased during 
      a predefined time window, from stable individuals. A prognostic model to predict 
      decline at 24 months in early Alzheimer's disease was trained on 1151 individuals
      who had baseline diagnoses of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's dementia 
      from ADNI and NACC. This model was validated on 115 individuals from a placebo
      arm of a Phase 3 clinical trial and 76 individuals from the PharmaCog dataset. A 
      second prognostic model to predict decline at 48 months in presymptomatic
      populations was trained on 628 individuals from ADNI and NACC who were
      cognitively unimpaired at baseline. This model was validated on 128 individuals
      from OASIS-3. RESULTS: The models achieved up to 79% area under the curve
      (cross-validated and out-of-sample). Power analyses showed that using prognostic 
      models to recruit enriched cohorts of predicted decliners can reduce clinical
      trial sample sizes by as much as 51% while maintaining the same detection power. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Prognostic tools for predicting cognitive decline and enriching
      clinical trials with participants at the highest risk of decline can improve
      trial quality, derisk endpoint failures, and accelerate therapeutic development
      in Alzheimer's disease.

      CTAD Task Force Report.
PG  - 393-399
LID - 10.14283/jpad.2022.48 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aducanumab (ADUHELMTM) was approved for the treatment of Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD) in the US. This approval was supported by an effect on the cerebral 
      amyloid plaque load and evidence of cognitive efficacy to be confirmed in
      post-marketing trials. Other anti-amyloid antibodies are under investigation in
      phase III (donanemab, lecanemab, gantenerumab) and have shown preliminary
      evidence of a cognitive benefit in phase II trials. Although these agents target 
      a small segment of patients with mild cognitive impairment due to AD or mild AD
      dementia, their advent will change the design of future clinical trials both for 
      anti-amyloid and non-amyloid drugs. These changes will promote the selection of
      patients in clinical trials by amyloid and tau biomarkers that identify patients 
      with appropriate biology and may follow the treatment response to approved
      amyloid antibodies. The use of these agents creates the opportunity to test
      combined drug therapies and to conduct comparative assessments with innovative
      therapies and newly approved drugs available in clinical practice. Blood-based AD
      biomarkers should be implemented in research and could facilitate the recruitment
      into clinical trials. Anti-amyloid antibodies will have positive (e.g., more
      early diagnosis) and negative impacts (some subjects will be reluctant to
      participate in trials and risk assignment to placebo) on AD trials in the
      immediate future. We present the results of the CTAD Task Force on this topic, in
      Boston, November 6, 2021.

AB  - As the last opportunity to assess treatment effect modification in a controlled
      setting prior to formal approval, clinical trials are a critical tool for
      understanding the safety and efficacy of new treatments in diverse populations.
      Recruitment of diverse participants in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) clinical trials
      are therefore essential to increase the generalizability of study results, with
      diversity broadly described to be representative and inclusive. This
      representation of study participants is equally critical in longitudinal cohort
      (observational) studies, which will be key to understanding disease disparities
      and are often used to design adequately powered AD clinical trials. New and
      innovative recruitment initiatives and enhanced infrastructure facilitate
      increased participant diversity in AD clinical studies.

TI  - P-tau subgroups in AD relate to distinct amyloid production and synaptic
      integrity profiles.
PG  - 95
LID - 10.1186/s13195-022-01038-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We previously identified four Alzheimer's disease (AD) subgroups with
      increasingly higher cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of tau phosphorylated at
      threonine 181 (p-tau). These subgroups included individuals across the cognitive 
      spectrum, suggesting p-tau subgroups could reflect distinct biological changes in
      AD, rather than disease severity. Therefore, in the current study, we further
      investigated which potential processes may be related with p-tau subgroups, by
      comparing individuals on CSF markers for presynaptic structure
      [vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2)], postsynaptic structure
      [neurogranin (NRGN)], axonal damage [neurofilament light (NfL)], and amyloid
      production [beta-secretase 1 (BACE1) and amyloid-beta 1-40 (Abeta40)]. METHODS:
      We selected 348 amyloid-positive (A+) individuals (53 preclinical, 102 prodromal,
      193 AD dementia) and 112 amyloid-negative (A-) cognitively normal (CN)
      individuals from the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort (ADC). Individuals were labeled
      according to their p-tau subgroup (subgroup 1: p-tau </= 56 pg/ml; subgroup 2:
      57-96 pg/ml; subgroup 3: 97-159 pg/ml; subgroup 4: > 159 pg/ml). CSF protein
      levels were measured with ELISA (NRGN, BACE1, Abeta40, NfL) or single-molecule
      array (Simoa) (VAMP2). We tested whether protein levels differed between the
      p-tau subgroups within A+ individuals with linear models corrected for age and
      sex and whether disease stage influenced these relationships. RESULTS: Among A+
      individuals, higher p-tau subgroups showed a higher percentage of AD dementia
      [subgroup 1: n = 41/94 (44%); subgroup 2: n = 81/147 (55%); subgroup 3: n = 59/89
      (66%); subgroup 4: n = 7/11 (64%)]. Relative to controls, subgroup 1 showed
      reduced CSF levels of BACE1, Abeta40, and VAMP2 and higher levels of NfL.
      Subgroups 2 to 4 showed gradually increased CSF levels of all measured proteins, 
      either across the first three (NfL and Abeta40) or across all subgroups (VAMP2,
      NRGN, BACE1). The associations did not depend on the clinical stage (interaction 
      p-values ranging between 0.19 and 0.87). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that
      biological heterogeneity in p-tau levels in AD is related to amyloid metabolism
      and synaptic integrity independent of clinical stage. Biomarkers reflecting
      amyloid metabolism and synaptic integrity may be useful outcome measures in
      clinical trials targeting tau pathology.

TI  - Titanium dioxide and carbon black nanoparticles disrupt neuronal homeostasis via 
      excessive activation of cellular prion protein signaling.
PG  - 48
LID - 10.1186/s12989-022-00490-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Epidemiological emerging evidence shows that human exposure to some
      nanosized materials present in the environment would contribute to the onset
      and/or progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The cellular and molecular
      mechanisms whereby nanoparticles would exert some adverse effects towards neurons
      and take part in AD pathology are nevertheless unknown. RESULTS: Here, we provide
      the prime evidence that titanium dioxide (TiO2) and carbon black (CB)
      nanoparticles (NPs) bind the cellular form of the prion protein (PrP(C)), a
      plasma membrane protein well known for its implication in prion diseases and
      prion-like diseases, such as AD. The interaction between TiO2- or CB-NPs and
      PrP(C) at the surface of neuronal cells grown in culture corrupts PrP(C)
      signaling function. This triggers PrP(C)-dependent activation of NADPH oxidase
      and subsequent production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that alters redox
      equilibrium. Through PrP(C) interaction, NPs also promote the activation of
      3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1), which in turn provokes the
      internalization of the neuroprotective TACE alpha-secretase. This diverts TACE
      cleavage activity away from (i) TNFalpha receptors (TNFR), whose accumulation at 
      the plasma membrane augments the vulnerability of NP-exposed neuronal cells to
      TNFalpha -associated inflammation, and (ii) the amyloid precursor protein APP,
      leading to overproduction of neurotoxic amyloid Abeta40/42 peptides. The
      silencing of PrP(C) or the pharmacological inhibition of PDK1 protects neuronal
      cells from TiO2- and CB-NPs effects regarding ROS production, TNFalpha
      hypersensitivity, and Abeta rise. Finally, we show that dysregulation of the
      PrP(C)-PDK1-TACE pathway likely occurs in the brain of mice injected with
      TiO2-NPs by the intra-cerebro-ventricular route as we monitor a rise of TNFR at
      the cell surface of several groups of neurons located in distinct brain areas.
      CONCLUSION: Our in vitro and in vivo study thus posits for the first time normal 
      cellular prion protein PrP(C) as being a neuronal receptor of TiO2- and CB-NPs
      and identifies PrP(C)-coupled signaling pathways by which those nanoparticles
      alter redox equilibrium, augment the intrinsic sensitivity of neurons to
      neuroinflammation, and provoke a rise of Abeta peptides. By identifying signaling
      cascades dysregulated by TiO2- and CB-NPs in neurons, our data shed light on how 
      human exposure to some NPs might be related to AD.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurological disorder characterized by 
      the pathological accumulation of macromolecular Abeta and tau leading to neuronal
      death. Drugs approved to treat AD may ameliorate disease symptoms, however, no
      curative treatment exists. Abeta peptides were discovered to be substrates of
      adenosine triphosphate-(ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. Activators of
      these membrane-bound efflux proteins that promote binding and/or translocation of
      Abeta could revolutionize AD medicine. The knowledge about ABC transporter
      activators is very scarce, however, the few molecules that were reported contain 
      substructural features of multitarget (pan-)ABC transporter inhibitors. A
      cutting-edge strategy to obtain new drug candidates is to explore and potentially
      exploit the recently proposed multitarget binding site of pan-ABC transporter
      inhibitors as anchor point for the development of innovative activators to
      promote Abeta clearance from the brain. Molecular associations between functional
      bioactivities and physicochemical properties of small-molecules are key to
      understand these processes. This study provides an analysis of a recently
      reported unique multitarget dataset for the correlation between multitarget
      bioactivity and physicochemistry. Six novel pan-ABC transporter inhibitors were
      validated containing substructural features of ABC transporter activators, which 
      underpins the relevance of the multitarget binding site for the targeted
      development of novel AD diagnostics and therapeutics.

AB  - Amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) oligomers are involved in the early stages of
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) and antibodies against these toxic oligomers could be
      useful for accurate diagnosis of AD. We identified the toxic conformer of Abeta42
      with a turn at positions 22/23, which has a propensity to form toxic oligomers.
      The antibody 24B3, developed by immunization of a toxic conformer surrogate
      E22P-Abeta9-35 in mice, was found to be useful for AD diagnosis using human
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). However, it is not known how 24B3 recognizes the toxic
      conformation of wild-type Abeta in CSF. Here, we report the crystal structure of 
      24B3 Fab complexed with E22P-Abeta11-34, whose residues 16-26 were observed in
      electron densities, suggesting that the residues comprising the toxic turn at
      positions 22/23 were recognized by 24B3. Since 24B3 bound only to Abeta42
      aggregates, several conformationally restricted analogs of Abeta42 with an
      intramolecular disulfide bond to mimic the conformation of toxic Abeta42
      aggregates were screened by enzyme immunoassay. As a result, only
      F19C,A30homoC-SS-Abeta42 (1) bound significantly to 24B3. These data provide a
      structural basis for its low affinity to the Abeta42 monomer and selectivity for 
      its aggregate form.

AB  - The European Prevention of Alzheimer Dementia (EPAD) is a multi-center study that
      aims to characterize the preclinical and prodromal stages of Alzheimer's Disease.
      The EPAD imaging dataset includes core (3D T1w, 3D FLAIR) and advanced (ASL,
      diffusion MRI, and resting-state fMRI) MRI sequences. Here, we give an overview
      of the semi-automatic multimodal and multisite pipeline that we developed to
      curate, preprocess, quality control (QC), and compute image-derived phenotypes
      (IDPs) from the EPAD MRI dataset. This pipeline harmonizes DICOM data structure
      across sites and performs standardized MRI preprocessing steps. A semi-automated 
      MRI QC procedure was implemented to visualize and flag MRI images next to
      site-specific distributions of QC features - i.e. metrics that represent image
      quality. The value of each of these QC features was evaluated through comparison 
      with visual assessment and step-wise parameter selection based on logistic
      regression. IDPs were computed from 5 different MRI modalities and their sanity
      and potential clinical relevance were ascertained by assessing their relationship
      with biological markers of aging and dementia. The EPAD v1500.0 data release
      encompassed core structural scans from 1356 participants 842 fMRI, 831 dMRI, and 
      858 ASL scans. From 1356 3D T1w images, we identified 17 images with poor quality
      and 61 with moderate quality. Five QC features - Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR),
      Contrast to Noise Ratio (CNR), Coefficient of Joint Variation (CJV),
      Foreground-Background energy Ratio (FBER), and Image Quality Rate (IQR) - were
      selected as the most informative on image quality by comparison with visual
      assessment. The multimodal IDPs showed greater impairment in associations with
      age and dementia biomarkers, demonstrating the potential of the dataset for
      future clinical analyses.

AB  - Parietal-hippocampal repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) improves
      cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease (AD), however, the underlying
      therapeutic mechanism has not been elucidated. A double-blind, randomized,
      sham-controlled parietal-hippocampal rTMS trial (five sessions/week for a total
      of 10 sessions) of mild-to-moderate AD patients was conducted in the study.
      High-frequency rTMS was applied to a subject-specific left lateral parietal
      region with the highest functional connectivity with the hippocampus based on
      resting-state fMRI. A multimodal MRI scan and a complete neuropsychological
      battery of tests were conducted at baseline, immediately after the intervention
      and 12-week follow-up after the rTMS treatment. Compared to sham treatment (n =
      27), patients undergoing active rTMS treatment (n = 29) showed higher Mini Mental
      State Examination (MMSE) score and dynamic functional connectivity (dFC)
      magnitude of the default mode network (DMN) after two weeks of rTMS treatment,
      but not at 12-week follow-up. A significant positive correlation was observed
      between changes in MMSE and changes in the dFC magnitude of DMN in patients who
      underwent active-rTMS treatment, but not in those who received sham-rTMS
      treatment. The findings of the current study indicate that fMRI-guided rTMS
      treatment improves cognitive function of AD patients in the short term, and DMN
      functional connectivity contributes to therapeutic effectiveness of rTMS.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly.
      Although AD is primarily a neurological disorder distinguished by amyloid beta
      plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, the immune system can impact
      the progression of the disease and may be targeted for therapeutic purposes. To
      date, most studies have focused on innate immune responses of microglia. However,
      emerging evidence implicates adaptive immune responses by T cells and B cells in 
      the progression of AD. Moreover, the recent approval of an antibody that promotes
      amyloid beta plaque clearance for AD therapy has pinpointed adaptive immunity as 
      a fertile ground for the design of novel therapeutic approaches. Here, we
      highlight key studies delineating T cell and B cell responses in human AD and
      mouse models of AD, identify open questions on the specificity, development and
      impact of these responses and discuss outlooks for future studies and novel
      therapeutic avenues.

      1H-indole derivatives were designed and synthesized via hybridization strategy of
      idalopirdine and SB-271046. The optimal compound C14 (Ki = 0.085 nM), with
      difluoromethyl on C3 position on indole scaffold, increased the affinity for the 
      5-HT6R up to 10-folds than idalopirdine (Ki = 0.83 nM). Additionally, C14 had
      good pharmacokinetic properties and in vitro metabolic properties. Finally, C14
      could efficiently reverse the scopolamine induced emotional memory deficits in
      novel object recognition assay in rats. Thus, we propose C14 might be considered 
      as a new cognition-enhancing agent and the further studies are now underway in
      our laboratory.

TI  - Deletion of serine racemase reverses neuronal insulin signaling inhibition by
      amyloid-beta oligomers.
LID - 10.1111/jnc.15664 [doi]
AB  - Dysregulation of insulin signaling in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain has been
      extensively reported. Serine racemase (SR) modulates insulin secretion in
      pancreatic islets. This study aimed to examine whether SR regulates insulin
      synthesis and secretion in neurons, thereby modulating insulin signaling in the
      AD brain. Srr-knockout (Srr(-/-) ) mice generated with the CRISPR/Cas9 technique 
      were used. Using immunofluorescence and fluorescence in situ hybridization,
      levels of insulin protein and insulin(ins2) mRNA were significantly increased in 
      the hippocampal but not in hypothalamic sections of Srr(-/-) mice compared with
      WT mice. Real-time quantitative PCR revealed that ins2 mRNA from primary
      hippocampal neuronal cultures of Srr(-/-) mice was significantly increased
      compared with that from cultured neurons of WT mice. Notably, the secretion of
      proinsulin C-peptide was increased in Srr(-/-) neurons relative to WT neurons. By
      examining membrane fractional proteins with immunoblotting, Srr(-/-) neurons
      retained ATP-dependent potassium channels on plasmalemma and correspondingly
      contained higher levels of p-AMPK. After treatment with Abeta42, the
      phosphorylation levels of insulin receptor substrate at serine 616 636
      (p-IRS1(ser616,636) ) were significantly lower, whereas p-AKT(308) and p-AKT(473)
      were higher in Srr(-/-) neurons than in WT neurons, respectively. The
      phosphorylated form of c-Jun N-terminal kinase decreased in the cultured Srr(-/-)
      neurons relative to the WT neurons upon Abeta42 treatment. In contrast,
      phosphorylated protein kinase R remained at the same levels. Further, reactive
      oxygen species were reduced in cultured Srr(-/-) neurons under Abeta42 treatment 
      relative to the WT neurons. Collectively, our study indicated that Srr deletion
      promoted insulin synthesis and secretion of proinsulin C-peptide, thereby
      reversing insulin resistance by Abeta42. This study suggests that targeting the
      neuronal SR may be utilized to enhance insulin signaling which is inhibited at
      the early stage of the AD brain.

TI  - Novel imaging markers for altered cerebrovascular morphology in aging, stroke,
      and Alzheimer's disease.
LID - 10.1111/jon.13023 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Altered brain vasculature is a key phenomenon in several 
      neurologic disorders. This paper presents a quantitative assessment of the
      anatomical variations in the Circle of Willis (CoW) and vascular morphology in
      healthy aging, acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). .
      METHODS: We used our novel automatic method to segment and extract geometric
      features of the cerebral vasculature from MR angiography scans of 175 healthy
      subjects, which were used to create a probabilistic atlas of cerebrovasculature
      and to study normal aging and intersubject variations in CoW anatomy.
      Subsequently, we quantified and analyzed vascular alterations in 45AIS and 50 AD 
      patients, two prominent cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative disorders. RESULTS:
      In the sampled cohort, we determined that the CoW is fully formed in only 35% of 
      healthy adults and found significantly (p < .05) increased tortuosity and
      fractality, with increasing age and also with disease in both AIS and AD. We also
      found significantly lower vessel length, volume, and number of branches in AIS
      patients, as expected. The AD cerebral vessels exhibited significantly smaller
      diameter and more complex branching patterns, compared to age-matched healthy
      adults. These changes were significantly heightened (p < .05) among healthy,
      early onset mild AD, and moderate/severe dementia groups. CONCLUSION: Although
      our study does not include longitudinal data due to paucity of such datasets, the
      specific geometric features and quantitative comparisons demonstrate the
      potential for using vascular morphology as a noninvasive imaging biomarker for
      neurologic disorders.

TI  - Independent APOE4 knock-in mouse models display reduced brain APOE protein,
      altered neuroinflammation, and simplification of dendritic spines.
LID - 10.1111/jnc.15665 [doi]
AB  - APOE is an immunomodulator in the brain and the major genetic risk factor for
      late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). Targeted replacement APOE mice (APOE-TR)
      have been a useful tool to study the effects of APOE isoforms on brain
      neurochemistry and activity prior to and during AD. We use newly available APOE
      knock-in mice (JAX-APOE) to compare phenotypes associated with APOE4 across
      models. Similar to APOE4-TR mice, JAX-E4 mouse brains showed 27% lower levels of 
      APOE protein compared with JAX-E3 (p < 0.001). We analyzed several
      neuroinflammatory molecules that have been associated with APOE genotype.
      SerpinA3 was much higher in APOE4-TR mice to APOE3-TR mice, but this effect was
      not seen in JAX-APOE mice. There were higher levels of IL-3 in JAX-E4 brains
      compared with JAX-E3, but other neuroinflammatory markers (IL6, TNFalpha) were
      not affected by APOE genotype. In terms of neuronal structure, basal dendritic
      spine density in the entorhinal cortex was 39% lower in JAX-E4 mice compared with
      JAX-E3 mice (p < 0.001), again similar to APOE-TR mice. One-week treatment with
      ibuprofen significantly increased dendritic spine density in the JAX-E4 mice,
      consistent with our previous finding in APOE-TR mice. Behaviorally, there was no 
      effect of APOE genotype on Barnes Maze learning and memory in 6-month-old
      JAX-APOE mice. Overall, the experiments performed in JAX-APOE mice validated
      findings from APOE-TR mice, identifying particularly strong effects of APOE4
      genotype on lower APOE protein levels and simplified neuron structure. These data
      demonstrate pathways that could promote susceptibility of APOE4 brains to AD
      pathological changes.

TI  - The kinectome: A comprehensive kinematic map of human motion in health and
      disease.
LID - 10.1111/nyas.14860 [doi]
AB  - Human voluntary movement stems from the coordinated activations in space and time
      of many musculoskeletal segments. However, the current methodological approaches 
      to study human movement are still limited to the evaluation of the synergies
      among a few body elements. Network science can be a useful approach to describe
      movement as a whole and to extract features that are relevant to understanding
      both its complex physiology and the pathophysiology of movement disorders. Here, 
      we propose to represent human movement as a network (that we named the
      kinectome), where nodes represent body points, and edges are defined as the
      correlations of the accelerations between each pair of them. We applied this
      framework to healthy individuals and patients with Parkinson's disease, observing
      that the patients' kinectomes display less symmetrical patterns as compared to
      healthy controls. Furthermore, we used the kinectomes to successfully identify
      both healthy and diseased subjects using short gait recordings. Finally, we
      highlighted topological features that predict the individual clinical impairment 
      in patients. Our results define a novel approach to study human movement. While
      deceptively simple, this approach is well-grounded, and represents a powerful
      tool that may be applied to a wide spectrum of frameworks.

      Disorder.
LID - 10.1097/WAD.0000000000000517 [doi]
AB  - Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is an autoimmune demyelinating
      disease of the central nervous system. Although recent reports have noted that
      cognitive impairment is common in NMOSD, little longitudinal information is
      available on the trajectories of cognitive function in the disease. Here, we
      report a case of a 55-year-old woman with an 11-year history of NMOSD who visited
      our memory clinic for progressive memory loss. She was diagnosed with early-onset
      Alzheimer disease based on amyloid and tau positron emission tomography imaging
      biomarkers. This is the first report of early-onset Alzheimer disease in a
      patient with NMOSD. Complications of Alzheimer disease should be considered when 
      patients with NMOSD exhibit rapid cognitive decline. More longitudinal studies of
      NMOSD with cognitive impairment are needed.

      inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy.
LID - 10.1111/ene.15496 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study was undertaken to explore associations between
      plasma neurofilament light chain (pNfL) concentration (pg/ml) and disease
      activity in patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating
      polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) and examine the usefulness of pNfL concentrations
      in determining disease remission. METHODS: We examined pNfL concentrations in
      treatment-naive CIDP patients (n = 10) before and after intravenous
      immunoglobulin (IVIg) induction treatment, in pNfL concentrations in patients on 
      maintenance IVIg treatment who had stable (n = 15) versus unstable disease (n =
      9), and in clinically stable IVIg-treated patients (n = 10) in whom we suspended 
      IVIg to determine disease activity and ongoing need for maintenance IVIg. pNfL
      concentrations in an age-matched healthy control group were measured for
      comparison. RESULTS: Among treatment-naive patients, pNfL concentration was
      higher in patients before IVIg treatment than healthy controls and subsequently
      reduced to be comparable to control group values after IVIg induction. Among CIDP
      patients on IVIg treatment, pNfL concentration was significantly higher in
      unstable patients than stable patients. A pNFL concentration > 16.6 pg/ml
      distinguished unstable treated CIDP from stable treated CIDP (sensitivity =
      86.7%, specificity = 66.7%, area under receiver operating characteristic curve = 
      0.73). Among the treatment withdrawal group, there was a statistically
      significant correlation between pNfL concentration at time of IVIg withdrawal and
      the likelihood of relapse (r = 0.72, p < 0.05), suggesting an association of
      higher pNfL concentration with active disease. CONCLUSIONS: pNfL concentrations
      may be a sensitive, clinically useful biomarker in assessing subclinical disease 
      activity.

AB  - Introduction: Globally, women with dementia have a higher disease burden than men
      with dementia. In addition, women with diabetes especially are at higher risk for
      cognitive impairment and dementia compared to men with diabetes. Differences in
      the influence of diabetes on the cerebral vasculature and brain structure may
      contribute to these sex-specific differences. We examined sex-specific patterns
      in the relationship between diabetes and brain structure, as well as diabetes and
      cognitive function. Methods: In total, 893 patients [age 79 +/- 6.6 years, 446
      (50%) women] from the Amsterdam Ageing Cohort with available data on brain
      structures (assessed by an MRI or CT scan) and cognitive function were included. 
      All patients underwent a thorough standardized clinical and neuropsychological
      assessment (including tests on memory, executive functioning, processing speed,
      language). Brain structure abnormalities were quantified using visual scales.
      Results: Cross-sectional multivariable regression analyses showed that diabetes
      was associated with increased incidence of cerebral lacunes and brain atrophy in 
      women (OR 2.18 (1.00-4.72) but not in men. Furthermore, diabetes was associated
      with decreased executive function, processing speed and language in women [B
      -0.07 (0.00-0.13), -0.06 (0.02-0.10) and -0.07 (0.01-0.12) resp.] but not in men.
      Conclusions: Diabetes is related to increased risk of having lacunes, brain
      atrophy and impaired cognitive function in women but not in men. Further research
      is required to understand the time trajectory leading up to these changes and to 
      understand the mechanisms behind them in order to improve preventive health care 
      for both sexes.

TI  - The Influence of Dementia Beliefs and Knowledge on Perceived Dementia Worry: An
      Empirical Study Among Adults in Rural China.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease and related dementias are more prevalent in rural areas than 
      in urban areas in China. This study aims to examine the role of dementia beliefs 
      and knowledge in influencing dementia worry among rural adults in China. Data
      were generated in a cross-sectional survey of 577 participants. Hierarchical
      regression analyses found that both the beliefs and knowledge of dementia
      contributed to higher levels of dementia worry. The propensity score matching
      method affirmed the robustness of regression results. In addition, those aged
      45-64 reported higher worry about dementia than those aged 65 or older, while
      being married was related to lower dementia worry. As one of the first kind
      studies that examined dementia worry in rural Chinese population, our findings
      suggest that policy and practice efforts should address cultural beliefs of
      dementia as they contributed to higher worry about dementia in rural areas.

TI  - Highly sensitive Curcumin-conjugated nanotheranostic platform for detecting
      amyloid-beta plaques by magnetic resonance imaging and reversing cognitive
      deficits of Alzheimer's disease via NLRP3-inhibition.
PG  - 322
LID - 10.1186/s12951-022-01524-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative
      disorder without effective therapy and lack diagnosis strategy for preclinical AD
      patients. There is an urgent need for development of both early diagnosis and
      therapeutic intervention of AD. RESULTS: Herein, we developed a nanotheranostics 
      platform consisting of Curcumin (Cur), an anti-inflammatory molecule, and
      superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles encapsulated by diblock
      1,2-dio-leoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-n-[poly(ethylene glycol)]
      (DSPE-PEG) that are modified with CRT and QSH peptides on its surface.
      Furthermore, we demonstrated that this multifunctional nanomaterial efficiently
      reduced beta-amyloid plaque burden specifically in APP/PS1 transgenic mice, with 
      the process noninvasively detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the
      two-dimensional MRI images were computed into three-dimension (3D) plot. Our data
      demonstrated highly sensitive in vivo detection of beta-amyloid plaques which
      more closely revealed real deposition of Abeta than previously reported and we
      quantified the volumes of plaques for the first time based on 3D plot. In
      addition, memory deficits of the mice were significantly rescued, probably
      related to inhibition of NLR Family Pyrin Domain Containing 3 (NLRP3)
      inflammasomes. CONCLUSIONS: Gathered data demonstrated that this theranostic
      platform may have both early diagnostic and therapeutic potential in AD.

TI  - Impaired time-distance reconfiguration patterns in Alzheimer's disease: a dynamic
      functional connectivity study with 809 individuals from 7 sites.
PG  - 280
LID - 10.1186/s12859-022-04776-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) has been used successfully 
      to investigate the dysfunction of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. The
      reconfiguration intensity of nodal dFC, which means the degree of alteration
      between FCs at different time scales, could provide additional information for
      understanding the reconfiguration of brain connectivity. RESULTS: In this paper, 
      we introduced a feature named time distance nodal connectivity diversity (tdNCD),
      and then evaluated the network reconfiguration intensity in every specific brain 
      region in AD using a large multicenter dataset (N = 809 from 7 independent
      sites). Our results showed that the dysfunction involved in three subnetworks in 
      AD, including the default mode network (DMN), the subcortical network (SCN), and 
      the cerebellum network (CBN). The nodal tdNCD inside the DMN increased in AD
      compared to normal controls, and the nodal dynamic FC of the SCN and the CBN
      decreased in AD. Additionally, the classification analysis showed that the
      classification performance was better when combined tdNCD and FC to classify AD
      from normal control (ACC = 81%, SEN = 83.4%, SPE = 80.6%, and F1-score = 79.4%)
      than that only using FC (ACC = 78.2%, SEN = 76.2%, SPE = 76.5%, and F1-score =
      77.5%) with a leave-one-site-out cross-validation. Besides, the performance of
      the three classes classification was improved from 50% (only using FC) to 53.3%
      (combined FC and tdNCD) (macro F1-score accuracy from 46.8 to 48.9%). More
      importantly, the classification model showed significant clinically predictive
      correlations (two classes classification: R = -0.38, P < 0.001; three classes
      classification: R = -0.404, P < 0.001). More importantly, several commonly used
      machine learning models confirmed that the tdNCD would provide additional
      information for classifying AD from normal controls. CONCLUSIONS: The present
      study demonstrated dynamic reconfiguration of nodal FC abnormities in AD. The
      tdNCD highlights the potential for further understanding core mechanisms of brain
      dysfunction in AD. Evaluating the tdNCD FC provides a promising way to understand
      AD processes better and investigate novel diagnostic brain imaging biomarkers for
      AD.

AB  - Emerging evidence has suggested a close correlation between COVID-19 and
      neurodegenerative disorders. However, whether there exists a causal association
      and the effect direction remains unknown. To examine the causative role of
      COVID-19 in the risk of neurodegenerative disorders, we estimated their genetic
      correlation, and then conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis
      using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies of susceptibility, 
      hospitalization, and severity of COVID-19, as well as six major neurodegenerative
      disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,
      frontotemporal dementia, Lewy body dementia, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's 
      disease. We identified a significant and positive genetic correlation between
      hospitalization of COVID-19 and AD (genetic correlation: 0.23, P = 8.36E-07).
      Meanwhile, hospitalization of COVID-19 was significantly associated with a higher
      risk of AD (OR: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01-1.03, P: 1.19E-03). Consistently,
      susceptibility (OR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.01-1.09, P: 9.30E-03) and severity (OR: 1.01,
      95% CI: 1.00-1.02, P: 0.012) of COVID-19 were nominally associated with higher
      risk of AD. The results were robust under all sensitivity analyses. These results
      demonstrated that COVID-19 could increase the risk of AD. Future development of
      preventive or therapeutic interventions could attach importance to this to
      alleviate the complications of COVID-19.

TI  - Clinically Relevant Changes for Cognitive Outcomes in Preclinical and Prodromal
      Cognitive Stages: Implications for Clinical Alzheimer Trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Identifying a clinically meaningful change in
      cognitive test score is essential when using cognition as an outcome in clinical 
      trials. This is especially relevant as clinical trials increasingly feature novel
      composites of cognitive tests. Our primary objective was to establish minimal
      clinically important differences (MCIDs) for commonly used cognitive tests, using
      anchor-based and distribution-based methods, and our secondary objective was to
      investigate a composite cognitive measure that best predicts a minimal change in 
      the Clinical Dementia Rating - Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB). METHODS: From the Swedish
      BioFINDER cohort study, we consecutively included cognitively unimpaired (CU)
      individuals with and without subjective or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We
      calculated MCIDs associated with a change of >/=0.5 or >/=1.0 on CDR-SB for MMSE,
      ADAS-cog delayed recall 10-word list, Stroop, Letter S Fluency, Animal Fluency,
      Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) and Trailmaking Test (TMT) A and B and
      triangulated MCIDs for clinical use for CU, MCI and amyloid positive CU. For
      investigating cognitive measures that best predict a change in CDR-SB of >/=0.5
      or >/=1.0 point we conducted ROC analyses. RESULTS: Our study included 451
      cognitively unimpaired individuals, 90 with subjective cognitive decline and 361 
      without symptoms of cognitive decline (pooled mean follow-up time 32.4 months, SD
      26.8, range 12-96 months) and 292 people with MCI (pooled mean follow-up time
      19.2 months, SD 19.0, range 12-72 months). We identified potential triangulated
      MCIDs (cognitively unimpaired; MCI) on a range of cognitive test outcomes: MMSE
      -1.5; -1.7, ADAS-delayed recall 1.4; 1.1, Stroop 5.5; 9.3, Animal Fluency: -2.8; 
      -2.9, Letter S Fluency -2.9; -1.8, SDMT -3.5; -3.8, TMT A 11.7; 13.0, TMT B 24.4;
      20.1. For amyloid positive CU we found the best predicting composite cognitive
      measure included gender, and changes in ADAS delayed recall, MMSE, SDMT and TMT
      B. This produced an AIC 130.5, AUC of 0.87 (95% CI 0.79-0.94, sensitivity 75%,
      specificity 88%). DISCUSSION: Our MCIDs may be applied in clinical practice or
      clinical trials for identifying if a clinically relevant change has occurred. The
      composite measure can be useful as a clinically relevant cognitive test outcome
      in preclinical AD trials.

TI  - Association of Mediterranean Diet With Cognitive Decline Among Diverse Hispanic
      or Latino Adults From the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos.
PG  - e2221982
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.21982 [doi]
AB  - Importance: The Mediterranean diet may reduce the burden of Alzheimer disease and
      other associated dementias in Hispanic or Latino people. Objective: To
      investigate the association of a Mediterranean diet with cognitive performance
      among community-dwelling Hispanic or Latino adults. Design, Setting, and
      Participants: This cohort study analyzed data from the Hispanic Community Health 
      Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) and the Study of Latinos-Investigation of
      Neurocognitive Aging (SOL-INCA), an HCHS/SOL ancillary study. Cognition tests
      were administered in the HCHS/SOL from March 2008 to June 2011 (visit 1) and in
      the SOL-INCA from October 2015 to March 2018 (visit 2). Participants included in 
      the present study had completed a diet assessment at visit 1 and neurocognitive
      evaluations at visits 1 and 2. Data were analyzed from September 2021 to May
      2022. Exposures: Mediterranean diet adherence was ascertained using the
      Mediterranean diet score (MDS) and was categorized as low (MDS: 0-4 points),
      moderate (MDS: 5-6 points), or high (MDS: 7-9 points). The mean of two 24-hour
      dietary recalls was used to calculate the MDS. Main Outcomes and Measures:
      Cognitive change between visits 1 and 2 was calculated by subtracting the
      cognitive score at visit 2 from the cognitive score at visit 1 and adjusting by
      the time elapsed between visits and cognitive score at visit 1. Neurocognitive
      tests administered were Brief Spanish-English Verbal Learning Test (B-SEVLT) Sum,
      B-SEVLT Recall, word fluency, and Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST). Results 
      of each test were z score-transformed and the means were averaged to create a
      global cognition score. Complex sample linear regression analysis was used to
      ascertain the association between MDS and neurocognitive performance at each
      visit and neurocognitive change. Results: A total of 6321 participants (mean [SE]
      age, 56.1 [0.18] years at visit 1; n = 4077 women [57.8%]) were included.
      Mediterranean diet adherence weighted frequencies were 35.8% (n = 2112 of 6321)
      for the low adherence group, 45.4% (n = 2795) for the moderate adherence group,
      and 18.8% (n = 1414) for the high adherence group. In the fully adjusted model, z
      score-transformed cognitive scores at visit 1 in the high vs low adherence groups
      were higher for B-SEVLT Sum (beta = 0.11; 95% CI, 0.02-0.20), B-SEVLT Recall
      (beta = 0.16; 95% CI, 0.07-0.25), and global cognition (beta = 0.10; 95% CI,
      0.04-0.16) tests. In the mean follow-up time of 7 years, cognitive change in the 
      high vs low adherence groups was less pronounced for B-SEVLT Sum (beta = 0.12;
      95% CI, 0.05-0.20) and B-SEVLT Recall (beta = 0.14; 95% CI, 0.05-0.23), but not
      for word fluency, DSST score, or global cognition score. Conclusions and
      Relevance: Results of this cohort study suggested that high adherence to a
      Mediterranean diet was associated with better cognitive performance and decreased
      7-year learning and memory decline among middle-aged and older Hispanic or Latino
      adults. Culturally tailored Mediterranean diet may reduce the risk of cognitive
      decline and Alzheimer disease in this population.

TI  - Effect of Probiotic Fungi against Cognitive Impairment in Mice via Regulation of 
      the Fungal Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis.
PG  - 9026-9038
LID - 10.1021/acs.jafc.2c03142 [doi]
AB  - The fungal microbiota may be involved in the regulation of cognition and
      behavior, while the role of probiotic fungi against cognitive impairment is
      unclear. Here, we explored the idea that probiotic Saccharomyces boulardii could 
      participate in the regulation of microglia-induced neuroinflammation in
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) model mice. Cognitive deficits, deposits of amyloid-beta
      (Abeta) and phosphorylation of tau, synaptic plasticity, microglia activation,
      and neuroinflammatory reactions were observed. The expression levels of Toll-like
      receptors (TLRs) pathway-related proteins were detected. Meanwhile, intestinal
      barrier integrity and fungal microbiota composition were evaluated. Our results
      showed fungal microbiota dysbiosis in APP/PS1 mice, which might result in the
      neuroinflammation of AD. The increased levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1beta,
      and cluster of differentiation 11b (CD11b) were observed in APP/PS1 mice, which
      were associated with activation of microglia, indicative of a broader recognition
      of neuroinflammation mediated by fungal microbiota compared to hitherto
      appreciated. Probiotic S. boulardii treatment improved dysbiosis, alleviated the 
      neuroinflammation as well as synaptic injury, and ultimately improved cognitive
      impairment. Moreover, S. boulardii therapy could inhibit microglia activation and
      the TLRs pathway, which were reversed by antifungal treatment. These findings
      revealed that S. boulardii actively participated in regulating the TLRs pathway
      to inhibit the neuroinflammation via the gut-brain axis.

AB  - The AD7c-NTP is a promising biomarker for AD diagnosis. However, the exact
      urinary AD7c-NTP concentration to differentiate AD from the mild cognitive
      impairment (MCI) remains inconclusive. We enrolled 98 and 90 clinical defined AD 
      and MCI patients, respectively, and access their cognition impairment with
      Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and Mental State Examination (MMSE) along with
      their urinary AD7c-NTP. We demonstrated that urinary AD7c-NTP level in sequence
      from high to low was AD, MCI, and healthy groups (P < .01), and the AD7c-NTP was 
      positively and negatively correlated with the NPI and MMSE scores, respectively. 
      Additionally, AD7c-NTP well-matched NPI subscale scores, including agitation,
      depression, and apathy (P < .05). Importantly, the optimal cut-off AD7c-NTP level
      to distinguish the AD and MCI was .94 ng/mL (sensitivity 85.71% & specificity
      73.91%). Conclusively, urinary AD7c-NTP could be used for cognition impairment
      evaluation and differentiated diagnosis of AD and MCI.

      receiving an amyloid PET scan.
LID - 10.1111/jgs.17937 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The primary objective of this paper was to examine perspectives and
      experiences of individuals with cognitive impairment who received an amyloid PET 
      scan and their care partners, with regard to the process, logistics, and
      decision-making associated with receiving an amyloid PET scan and its results.
      METHODS: Structured telephone interviews were conducted with 200 randomly sampled
      scan recipient/care partner dyads from the CARE IDEAS study. The audio-recorded, 
      transcribed responses were analyzed using an inductive qualitative content
      analytic approach. RESULTS: Participating individuals and care partners described
      their experiences in seeking a diagnosis for memory issues, including
      decision-making and logistics involved with receiving an amyloid PET scan.
      Participants discussed the factors contributing to their decision to seek a
      diagnosis for their memory issues and their hopes and expectations in completing 
      the scan. Participants also described the trajectory of this process, and
      although some described relatively straightforward trajectories, others described
      problems associated with identifying appropriate providers and coordinating care 
      across numerous providers to obtain a diagnosis for their memory issues.
      Participants described an additional challenge of physicians attributing
      cognitive decline to normal aging, rather than signs of a neurodegenerative
      disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Findings shed light on the barriers and delays that
      individuals and care partners experience in connecting with physicians and
      obtaining a comprehensive evaluation for cognitive problems. Results from this
      study have implications for physicians who provide care to older adults, and
      specifically highlight the need for greater care coordination and clearer
      communication with and systems of referral for patients.

TI  - MiR-483-3p improves learning and memory abilities via XPO1 in Alzheimer's
      disease.
PG  - e2680
LID - 10.1002/brb3.2680 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD), a common form of dementia, has been
      reported to influence 27 million individuals globally. Several risk factors
      including oxidative stress, gut microbiota imbalance, and cognitive activity are 
      reported to be closely associated with the initiation or progression of AD.
      Although miR-483-3p was identified to be downregulated in AD patient serum.
      However, the biological role and mechanism of miR-483-3p remained unknown in AD. 
      Here, we explored the role of miR-483-3p in AD. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were
      injected with homocysteine (Hcy) to establish an AD animal model. The Morris
      water maze tests and contextual fear tests were conducted to assess the cognitive
      and memory abilities of rats. TUNEL staining was utilized to determine cell
      apoptosis. Luciferase reporter assay was used to evaluate the binding relation
      between miR-483-3p and exportin 1 (XPO1). RESULTS: Homocysteine treatment (400
      mug/kg) induced the learning, cognitive and memory defects of rats. miR-483-3p
      was downregulated in Hcy-treated rat hippocampus. Functionally, miR-483-3p
      alleviated cell apoptosis and impairments of learning and memory abilities in
      Hcy-treated rats. In addition, miR-483-3p inhibited cell apoptosis and protein
      level of AD-associated factors (APP, BACE1, and Abeta1-42) in PC12 cells. In
      mechanism, miR-483-3p was confirmed to target XPO1 in PC12 cells. XPO1 displayed 
      high level in rat hippocampus and was negatively correlated with miR-483-3p
      levels. Finally, XPO1 overexpression rescued the suppressive effect of miR-483-3p
      on cell apoptosis and protein levels of AD-associated factors. CONCLUSIONS:
      miR-483-3p alleviates neural cell apoptosis and impairments of learning and
      memory abilities by targeting XPO1 in AD.

TI  - Identification of Alzheimer's Disease Progression Stages Using Topological
      Measures of Resting-State Functional Connectivity Networks: A Comparative Study.
PG  - 9958525
LID - 10.1155/2022/9958525 [doi]
AB  - Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has been widely
      employed to examine brain functional connectivity (FC) alterations in various
      neurological disorders. At present, various computational methods have been
      proposed to estimate connectivity strength between different brain regions, as
      the edge weight of FC networks. However, little is known about which model is
      more sensitive to Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. This study comparatively 
      characterized topological properties of rs-FC networks constructed with Pearson
      correlation (PC), dynamic time warping (DTW), and group information guided
      independent component analysis (GIG-ICA), aimed at investigating the sensitivity 
      and effectivity of these methods in differentiating AD stages. A total of 54
      subjects from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ANDI) database,
      divided into healthy control (HC), mild cognition impairment (MCI), and AD
      groups, were included in this study. Network-level (global efficiency and
      characteristic path length) and nodal (clustering coefficient) metrics were used 
      to capture groupwise difference across HC, MCI, and AD groups. The results showed
      that almost no significant differences were found according to global efficiency 
      and characteristic path length. However, in terms of clustering coefficient, 52
      brain parcels sensitive to AD progression were identified in rs-FC networks built
      with GIG-ICA, much more than PC (6 parcels) and DTW (3 parcels). This indicates
      that GIG-ICA is more sensitive to AD progression than PC and DTW. The findings
      also confirmed that the AD-linked FC alterations mostly appeared in temporal,
      cingulate, and angular areas, which might contribute to clinical diagnosis of AD.
      Overall, this study provides insights into the topological properties of rs-FC
      networks over AD progression, suggesting that FC strength estimation of FC
      networks cannot be neglected in AD-related graph analysis.

TI  - The perspectives of family caregivers of people with Alzheimer s disease
      regarding advance care planning in China: a qualitative research.
PG  - 464
LID - 10.1186/s12888-022-04106-8 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Advance care planning (ACP) enables people to define goals and
      preferences for future medical treatment and care. Despite universal recognition 
      of the importance of ACP for people with Alzheimer s disease (AD)
      internationally, there is little support for its implementation in China. The
      viewpoint of family caregivers is crucial in making clinical decisions about AD. 
      Therefore, it's critical to understand the family caregivers' perspectives on ACP
      in order to promote its practice among people with AD in China. METHODS:
      Seventeen family caregivers of people with AD were purposively selected in three 
      communities in Guangzhou. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to collect
      data and the data were analyzed using the thematic analysis. RESULTS: Three main 
      themes were extracted: 1 in circleAttitudes toward ACP including positive and
      negative attitudes; 2 in circleSocial pressure influencing ACP decision; 3 in
      circleBehavioral willingness of the implementation of ACP. CONCLUSIONS:
      Attitudes, social pressure, and behavioral willingness characterized the
      behavioral intentions of family caregivers of people with Alzheimer's disease. It
      is recommended to strengthen efforts to publicity of advance care planning and
      promote legislation in China.

PG  - 249-255

AB  - Our body has a remarkable ability to remember its past encounters with allergens,
      pathogens, wounds and irritants, and to react more quickly to the next
      experience. This accentuated sensitivity also helps us to cope with new threats. 
      Despite maintaining a state of readiness and broadened resistance to subsequent
      pathogens, memories can also be maladaptive, leading to chronic inflammatory
      disorders and cancers. With the ever-increasing emergence of new pathogens,
      allergens and pollutants in our world, the urgency to unravel the molecular
      underpinnings of these phenomena has risen to new heights. Here we reflect on how
      the field of inflammatory memory has evolved, since 2007, when researchers
      realized that non-specific memory is contained in the nucleus and propagated at
      the epigenetic level. We review the flurry of recent discoveries revealing that
      memory is not just a privilege of the immune system but also extends to epithelia
      of the skin, lung, intestine and pancreas, and to neurons. Although still
      unfolding, epigenetic memories of inflammation have now been linked to possible
      brain disorders such as Alzheimer disease, and to an elevated risk of cancer. In 
      this Review, we consider the consequences-good and bad-of these epigenetic
      memories and their implications for human health and disease.

TI  - The heritability of vocal tract structures estimated from structural MRI in a
      large cohort of Dutch twins.
LID - 10.1007/s00439-022-02469-2 [doi]
AB  - While language is expressed in multiple modalities, including sign, writing, or
      whistles, speech is arguably the most common. The human vocal tract is capable of
      producing the bewildering diversity of the 7000 or so currently spoken languages,
      but relatively little is known about its genetic bases, especially in what
      concerns normal variation. Here, we capitalize on five cohorts totaling 632 Dutch
      twins with structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Two raters placed
      clearly defined (semi)landmarks on each MRI scan, from which we derived 146
      measures capturing the dimensions and shape of various vocal tract structures,
      but also aspects of the head and face. We used Genetic Covariance Structure
      Modeling to estimate the additive genetic, common environmental or non-additive
      genetic, and unique environmental components, while controlling for various
      confounds and for any systematic differences between the two raters. We found
      high heritability, h(2), for aspects of the skull and face, the mandible, the
      anteroposterior (horizontal) dimension of the vocal tract, and the position of
      the hyoid bone. These findings extend the existing literature, and open new
      perspectives for understanding the complex interplay between genetics,
      environment, and culture that shape our vocal tracts, and which may help explain 
      cross-linguistic differences in phonetics and phonology.

TI  - Decreasing pdzd8-mediated mito-ER contacts improves organismal fitness and
      mitigates Abeta42 toxicity.
LID - e202201531 [pii]
LID - 10.26508/lsa.202201531 [doi]
AB  - Mitochondria-ER contact sites (MERCs) orchestrate many important cellular
      functions including regulating mitochondrial quality control through mitophagy
      and mediating mitochondrial calcium uptake. Here, we identify and functionally
      characterize the Drosophila ortholog of the recently identified mammalian MERC
      protein, Pdzd8. We find that reducing pdzd8-mediated MERCs in neurons slows
      age-associated decline in locomotor activity and increases lifespan in
      Drosophila. The protective effects of pdzd8 knockdown in neurons correlate with
      an increase in mitophagy, suggesting that increased mitochondrial turnover may
      support healthy aging of neurons. In contrast, increasing MERCs by expressing a
      constitutive, synthetic ER-mitochondria tether disrupts mitochondrial transport
      and synapse formation, accelerates age-related decline in locomotion, and reduces
      lifespan. Although depletion of pdzd8 prolongs the survival of flies fed with
      mitochondrial toxins, it is also sufficient to rescue locomotor defects of a fly 
      model of Alzheimer's disease expressing Amyloid beta42 (Abeta42). Together, our
      results provide the first in vivo evidence that MERCs mediated by the tethering
      protein pdzd8 play a critical role in the regulation of mitochondrial quality
      control and neuronal homeostasis.

TI  - Abnormal brain iron accumulation in obstructive sleep apnea: A quantitative MRI
      study in the HypnoLaus cohort.
PG  - e13698
LID - 10.1111/jsr.13698 [doi]
AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA) may be a risk factor for Alzheimer's
      disease. One of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease is disturbed iron
      homeostasis leading to abnormal iron deposition in brain tissue. To date, there
      is no empirical evidence to support the hypothesis of altered brain iron
      homeostasis in patients with obstructive sleep apnea as well. Data were analysed 
      from 773 participants in the HypnoLaus study (mean age 55.9 +/- 10.3 years) who
      underwent polysomnography and brain MRI. Cross-sectional associations were tested
      between OSA parameters and the MRI effective transverse relaxation rate (R2*) -
      indicative of iron content - in 68 grey matter regions, after adjustment for
      confounders. The group with severe OSA (apnea-hypopnea index >/=30/h) had higher 
      iron levels in the left superior frontal gyrus (F3,760 = 4.79, p = 0.003), left
      orbital gyri (F3,760 = 5.13, p = 0.002), right and left middle temporal gyrus
      (F3,760 = 4.41, p = 0.004 and F3,760 = 13.08, p < 0.001, respectively), left
      angular gyrus (F3,760 = 6.29, p = 0.001), left supramarginal gyrus (F3,760 =
      4.98, p = 0.003), and right cuneus (F3,760 = 7.09, p < 0.001). The parameters of 
      nocturnal hypoxaemia were all consistently associated with higher iron levels.
      Measures of sleep fragmentation had less consistent associations with iron
      content. This study provides the first evidence of increased brain iron levels in
      obstructive sleep apnea. The observed iron changes could reflect underlying
      neuropathological processes that appear to be driven primarily by hypoxaemic
      mechanisms.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine whether electrocardiogram (ECG) markers are associated
      with incident non-Alzheimer's dementia (non-AD) and whether these markers also
      improve risk prediction for non-AD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively
      included 170,605 primary care patients aged 60 years or older referred for an ECG
      by their general practitioner and followed them for a median of 7.6 years. Using 
      Cox regression, we reported hazard ratios (HRs) for electrocardiogram markers.
      Subsequently, we evaluated if addition of these electrocardiogram markers to a
      clinical model improved risk prediction for non-AD using change in area under the
      receiver-operator characteristics curve (AUC). RESULTS: The 5-year cumulative
      incidence of non-AD was 3.4 %. Increased heart rate (HR=1.06 pr. 10 bpm [95%
      confidence interval: 1.04-1.08], p<0.001), shorter QRS duration (HR=1.07 pr. 10
      ms [1.05-1.09], p<0.001), elevated J-amplitude (HR=1.16 pr. mm [1.08-1.24],
      p<0.001), decreased T-peak amplitude (HR=1.02 pr. mm [1.01-1.04], p=0.002), and
      increased QTc (HR=1.08 pr. 20 ms [1.05-1.10], p<0.001) were associated with an
      increased rate of non-AD. Atrial fibrillation on the ECG (HR=1.18 [1.08-1.28],
      p<0.001) Sokolow-Lyon index > 35 mm (HR=1.31 [1.18-1.46], p<0.001) and borderline
      (HR=1.18 [1.11-1.26], p<0.001) or abnormal (HR=1.40 [1.27-1.55], p<0.001) QRS-T
      angle were also associated with an increased rate of non-AD. Upon addition of ECG
      markers to the Cox model, 5-year and 10-year C-statistic (AUC) improved
      significantly (delta-AUC, 0.36 [0.18-0.50] and 0.20 [0.03-0.35] %-points,
      respectively). CONCLUSIONS: ECG markers typical of an elevated cardiovascular
      risk profile were associated with non-AD and improved both 5-year and 10-year
      risk predictions for non-AD.

AB  - Aging is a primary risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases, such as
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). SIRT2, an NAD(+)(nicotinamide adenine
      dinucleotide)-dependent deacetylase, accumulates in the aging brain. Here, we
      report that, in the amyloid precursor protein (APP)/PS1 transgenic mouse model of
      AD, genetic deletion of SIRT2 or pharmacological inhibition of SIRT2 ameliorates 
      cognitive impairment. We find that suppression of SIRT2 enhances acetylation of
      APP, which promotes non-amyloidogenic processing of APP at the cell surface,
      leading to increased soluble APP-alpha (sAPPalpha). We discover that lysines 132 
      and 134 of the major pathogenic protein beta-amyloid (Abeta) precursor are
      acetylated and that these residues are deacetylated by SIRT2. Strikingly,
      exogenous expression of wild-type or an acetylation-mimic APP mutant protects
      cultured primary neurons from Abeta42 challenge. Our study identifies
      SIRT2-mediated deacetylation of APP on K132 and K134 as a regulated
      post-translational modification (PTM) and suggests inhibition of SIRT2 as a
      potential therapeutic strategy for AD.

TI  - Polygenic score for Alzheimer's disease identifies differential atrophy in
      hippocampal subfield volumes.
PG  - e0270795
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0270795 [doi]
AB  - Hippocampal subfield atrophy is a prime structural change in the brain,
      associated with cognitive aging and neurodegenerative diseases such as
      Alzheimer's disease. Recent developments in genome-wide association studies
      (GWAS) have identified genetic loci that characterize the risk of hippocampal
      volume loss based on the processes of normal and abnormal aging. Polygenic risk
      scores are the genetic proxies mimicking the genetic role of the pre-existing
      vulnerabilities of the underlying mechanisms influencing these changes.
      Discriminating the genetic predispositions of hippocampal subfield atrophy
      between cognitive aging and neurodegenerative diseases will be helpful in
      understanding the disease etiology. In this study, we evaluated the polygenic
      risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD PGRS) for hippocampal subfield atrophy in 1,086
      individuals (319 cognitively normal (CN), 591 mild cognitively impaired (MCI),
      and 176 Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD)). Our results showed a stronger
      association of AD PGRS effect on the left hemisphere than on the right hemisphere
      for all the hippocampal subfield volumes in a mixed clinical population
      (CN+MCI+ADD). The subfields CA1, CA4, hippocampal tail, subiculum, presubiculum, 
      molecular layer, GC-ML-DG, and HATA showed stronger AD PGRS associations with the
      MCI+ADD group than with the CN group. The subfields CA3, parasubiculum, and
      fimbria showed moderately higher AD PGRS associations with the MCI+ADD group than
      with the CN group. Our findings suggest that the eight subfield regions, which
      were strongly associated with AD PGRS are likely involved in the early stage ADD 
      and a specific focus on the left hemisphere could enhance the early prediction of
      ADD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Individuals with probable Alzheimer disease (AD) may perform below
      cutoffs on traditional, memory-based performance validity tests. Previous studies
      have found success using event-related potentials (ERPs) to detect feigned
      neurocognitive impairment in younger populations. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the
      utility of an auditory oddball task in conjunction with the P3b peak amplitude to
      distinguish probable AD from simulated dementia. METHOD: Twenty individuals with 
      probable AD and 20 older healthy controls (HC) underwent an ERP auditory oddball 
      protocol and the Test of Memory Malingering (TOMM). The HC were asked to perform 
      honestly for one condition and to simulate dementia for the other. The
      individuals with probable AD were asked to perform honestly. The P3b peak
      amplitude and button press accuracy were collected from each participant and were
      analyzed to determine their effectiveness in detecting performance validity.
      RESULTS: The P3b peak amplitude remained stable regardless of behavioral
      condition in the HC group. When combined with the TOMM Trial 2 score, the P3b
      peak amplitude further improved the ability to correctly differentiate
      individuals with probable AD from HC simulating dementia with 100% sensitivity
      and 90% specificity. CONCLUSION: The P3b peak amplitude was found to be an
      effective physiologic measure of cognitive impairment in individuals with
      probable AD compared with HC simulating dementia. When combined with the TOMM
      Trial 2 score, the P3b peak amplitude served as a promising performance validity 
      measure for differentiating individuals with probable AD from HC simulating
      dementia.

TI  - The landscape of metabolic brain alterations in Alzheimer's disease.
LID - 10.1002/alz.12714 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is accompanied by metabolic alterations
      both in the periphery and the central nervous system. However, so far, a global
      view of AD-associated metabolic changes in the brain has been missing. METHODS:
      We metabolically profiled 500 samples from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.
      Metabolite levels were correlated with eight clinical parameters, covering both
      late-life cognitive performance and AD neuropathology measures. RESULTS: We
      observed widespread metabolic dysregulation associated with AD, spanning 298
      metabolites from various AD-relevant pathways. These included alterations to
      bioenergetics, cholesterol metabolism, neuroinflammation, and metabolic
      consequences of neurotransmitter ratio imbalances. Our findings further suggest
      impaired osmoregulation as a potential pathomechanism in AD. Finally, inspecting 
      the interplay of proteinopathies provided evidence that metabolic associations
      were largely driven by tau pathology rather than amyloid beta pathology.
      DISCUSSION: This work provides a comprehensive reference map of metabolic brain
      changes in AD that lays the foundation for future mechanistic follow-up studies.

      disease.
LID - 10.1002/jcp.30829 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease that is
      responsible for about one-third of dementia cases worldwide. It is believed that 
      AD is initiated with the deposition of Ab plaques in the brain. Genetic studies
      have shown that a high number of AD risk genes are expressed by microglia, the
      resident macrophages of brain. Common mode of action by microglia cells is
      neuroinflammation and phagocytosis. Moreover, it has been discovered that
      inflammatory marker levels are increased in AD patients. Recent studies advocate 
      that neuroinflammation plays a major role in AD progression. Microglia have
      different activation profiles depending on the region of brain and stimuli. In
      different activation, profile microglia can generate either pro-inflammatory or
      anti-inflammatory responses. Microglia defend brain cells from pathogens and
      respond to injuries; also, microglia can lead to neuronal death along the way. In
      this review, we will bring the different roles played by microglia and
      microglia-related genes in the progression of AD.

TI  - Effects of alpha5 GABAA receptor modulation on social interaction, memory, and
      neuroinflammation in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
LID - 10.1111/cns.13914 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: GABAergic modulation involved in cognitive processing appears to be
      substantially changed in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In a widely used 5xFAD model
      of AD, we aimed to assess if negative and positive allosteric modulators of
      alpha5 GABAA receptors (NAM and PAM, respectively) would affect social
      interaction, social, object and spatial memory, and neuroinflammation. METHODS:
      After 10-day treatment with PAM, NAM, or solvent, 6-month-old transgenic and
      non-transgenic 5xFAD mice underwent testing in a behavioral battery. Gene
      expressions of IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, GFAP, and IBA-1 were determined in
      hippocampus and prefrontal cortex by qPCR. RESULTS: PAM treatment impaired
      spatial learning in transgenic females compared to solvent-treated transgenic
      females, and social recognition in transgenic and non-transgenic males. NAM
      treatment declined social interaction in transgenic and non-transgenic males,
      while had beneficial effect on cognitive flexibility in non-transgenic males
      compared to solvent-treated non-transgenic males. Transgenic animals have not
      fully displayed cognitive symptoms, but neuroinflammation was confirmed. NAM
      reduced proinflammatory gene expressions in transgenic females and astrogliosis
      in transgenic males compared to pathological controls. CONCLUSION: PAM and NAM
      failed to exert favorable behavioral effects in transgenic animals. Suppression
      of neuroinflammation obtained with NAM calls for more studies with GABAergic
      ligands in amyloid beta- and/or tau-dependent models with prominent
      neuroinflammation.

TI  - Early loss of locus coeruleus innervation promotes cognitive and
      neuropathological changes before amyloid plaque deposition in a transgenic rat
      model of Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - e12835
LID - 10.1111/nan.12835 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The locus coeruleus (LC) is the main source of noradrenaline (NA) in the
      mammalian brain and has been found to degenerate during the initial stages of
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies indicate that at late stages of the
      amyloid pathology, LC-pathological alterations accelerate AD-like pathology
      progression by interfering with the neuromodulatory and anti-inflammatory
      properties of NA. However, the impact of LC degeneration at the earliest stages
      of amyloidosis on the AD-like pathology is not well understood. METHODS: The LC
      was lesioned in wild-type and McGill-R-Thy1-APP transgenic (APP tg) rats by
      administering N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-bromo-benzylamine before amyloid plaque
      deposition. Cognitive deficits and AD-like neuropathological changes were
      measured after the LC lesion. RESULTS: Four months post-treatment, rats displayed
      a decrease in brain noradrenergic innervation. The LC lesion in APP tg-treated
      rats enhanced cognitive deficits and decreased hippocampal cholinergic
      innervation and neurotrophin expression. In addition, the APP tg-treated rats
      displayed an increased microglial and astroglial cell number in close vicinity to
      hippocampal amyloid-beta burdened neurons. The recruited microglia showed
      cellular alterations indicative of an intermediate activation state. CONCLUSIONS:
      Our results indicate that early LC demise aggravates the early neuroinflammatory 
      process, cognitive impairments, cholinergic deficits and neurotrophin
      deregulation at the earliest stages of the human-like brain amyloidosis.

TI  - Vitamin D supplementation worsens Alzheimer's progression: Animal model and human
      cohort studies.
PG  - e13670
LID - 10.1111/acel.13670 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin D deficiency has been epidemiologically linked to Alzheimer's disease
      (AD) and other dementias, but no interventional studies have proved causality.
      Our previous work revealed that the genomic vitamin D receptor (VDR) is already
      converted into a non-genomic signaling pathway by forming a complex with p53 in
      the AD brain. Here, we extend our previous work to assess whether it is
      beneficial to supplement AD mice and humans with vitamin D. Intriguingly, we
      first observed that APP/PS1 mice fed a vitamin D-sufficient diet showed
      significantly lower levels of serum vitamin D, suggesting its deficiency may be a
      consequence not a cause of AD. Moreover, supplementation of vitamin D led to
      increased Abeta deposition and exacerbated AD. Mechanistically, vitamin D
      supplementation did not rescue the genomic VDR/RXR complex but instead enhanced
      the non-genomic VDR/p53 complex in AD brains. Consistently, our population-based 
      longitudinal study also showed that dementia-free older adults (n = 14,648)
      taking vitamin D3 supplements for over 146 days/year were 1.8 times more likely
      to develop dementia than those not taking the supplements. Among those with
      pre-existing dementia (n = 980), those taking vitamin D3 supplements for over 146
      days/year had 2.17 times the risk of mortality than those not taking the
      supplements. Collectively, these animal model and human cohort studies caution
      against prolonged use of vitamin D by AD patients.

TI  - Diagnosis of coexistent neurodegenerative dementias in multiple sclerosis.
PG  - fcac167
LID - 10.1093/braincomms/fcac167 [doi]
AB  - Among people with multiple sclerosis, cognitive impairment occurs commonly and is
      a potent predictor of disability. Some multiple sclerosis patients present with
      severe cognitive impairment, and distinguishing multiple sclerosis-related
      cognitive impairment from co-existent progressive neurodegenerative diseases such
      as Alzheimer disease poses a diagnostic challenge. The use of biomarkers such as 
      PET and CSF proteins may facilitate this distinction. The study was a
      retrospective, descriptive study on convenience samples of separate cohorts, one 
      of cognitively impaired multiple sclerosis patients evaluated on autopsy to
      demonstrate coincidence of both multiple sclerosis and neurodegenerative
      cognitive diseases. The second cohort were cognitively impaired multiple
      sclerosis patients evaluated by biomarker to investigate possible additional
      neurodegenerative cognitive disorders contributing to the cognitive impairment.
      We investigated selected biomarkers among 31 severely impaired patients
      (biomarker cohort) and 12 severely impaired patients assessed at autopsy and
      selected 24 (23 biomarker cohort, 1 autopsy cohort) had comprehensive
      neurocognitive testing. Biomarker cohort investigations included
      18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose PET and/or CSF amyloid Abeta1-42, phospho-tau and total
      tau levels. The autopsy cohort was evaluated with comprehensive neuropathological
      assessment for aetiology of cognitive impairment. The cohorts shared similar sex,
      age at multiple sclerosis onset and multiple sclerosis clinical course. The
      autopsy-cohort patients were older at diagnosis (69.5 versus 57 years, P =
      0.006), had longer disease duration [median (range) 20 years (3-59) versus 9
      (1-32), P = 0.001] and had more impaired bedside mental status scores at last
      follow-up [Kokmen median (range) 23 (1-38) versus 31 (9-34) P = 0.01].
      Autopsy-cohort patients confirmed, or excluded, coexistent neurogenerative
      disease by neuropathology gold standard. Most biomarker-cohort patients had
      informative results evaluating coexistent neurogenerative disease. Biomarkers may
      be useful in indicating a coexistent neurodegenerative disease earlier, and in
      life, in patients with multiple sclerosis and significant cognitive impairment.

      BDNF Levels in a Cohort of Healthy Older Adults.
PG  - 700838
LID - 10.3389/fragi.2021.700838 [doi]
AB  - An enriched environment is effective in stimulating learning and memory in animal
      models as well as in humans. Environmental enrichment increases brain-derived
      neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in aged rats and reduces levels of Alzheimer-related
      proteins in the blood, including amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides and misfolded
      toxic forms of tau. To address whether stimulation of curiosity, which is a form 
      of enrichment, may provide a buffer against Alzheimer's disease (AD), we measured
      levels of biomarkers associated with AD at baseline and after a 6-week
      intervention in older adults (>65 years of age) randomized to one of three
      different intervention conditions. Specifically, in this pilot study, we tested
      the effectiveness of a traditional, structured learning environment compared to a
      self-motivated learning environment designed to stimulate curiosity. There were
      no significant differences from baseline to post-intervention in any of the
      groups for Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio or t-tau (total-tau) plasma levels. Serum BDNF
      levels decreased significantly in the control group. Interestingly, individuals
      who had the lowest serum BDNF levels at baseline experienced significantly higher
      increases in BDNF over the course of the 6-week intervention compared to
      individuals with higher serum BDNF levels at baseline. As expected, older
      individuals had lower MoCA scores. Years of education correlated negatively with 
      Abeta levels, suggesting a protective effect of education on levels of this toxic
      protein. ECog scores were negatively correlated with BDNF levels, suggesting that
      better performance on the ECog questionnaire was associated with higher BDNF
      levels. Collectively, these findings did not suggest that a 6-week cognitive
      training intervention focused on curiosity resulted in significant alterations in
      blood biomarkers but showed interesting correlations between cognitive scores and
      BDNF levels, further supporting the role of this trophic factor in brain health
      in older adults.

AB  - Introduction: Physical activity (PA) promotes resilience with respect to
      cognitive decline, although the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. We
      examined the associations between objectively measured PA and resting-state
      functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fcMRI) across seven
      anatomically distributed neural networks. Methods: rs-fcMRI, amyloid beta (Abeta)
      positron emission tomography (PET), PA (steps/day x 1 week), and longitudinal
      cognitive (Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite) data from 167 cognitively
      unimpaired adults (ages 63 to 90) were used. We used linear and linear
      mixed-effects regression models to examine the associations between baseline PA
      and baseline network connectivity and between PA, network connectivity, and
      longitudinal cognitive performance. Results: Higher PA was associated selectively
      with greater connectivity in three networks previously associated with cognitive 
      decline (default, salience, left control). This association with network
      connectivity accounted for a modest portion of PA's effects on Abeta-related
      cognitive decline. Discussion: Although other mechanisms are likely present, PA
      may promote resilience with respect to Ass-related cognitive decline, partly by
      increasing connectivity in a subset of cognitive networks.

TI  - Increased cytokine gene expression and cognition risk associated with androgen
      deprivation therapy.
LID - 10.1002/pros.24411 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is a standard treatment modality
      for locally advanced, high-risk, and metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate
      cancer. Long-term ADT treatment likely develops side-effects that include changes
      in cognition or onset of dementia. However, the molecular understanding of this
      effect remains elusive. We attempt to establish a link between ADT and changes in
      cognitive function using patient databases and bioinformatics analyses. METHODS: 
      Gene expression profiling was performed using RNA sequencing data from Alzheimer 
      patient cohort and compared with the data from advanced-stage prostate cancer
      patients receiving neoadjuvant antiandrogen therapy. Differentially expressed
      genes (DEGs) were analyzed using the Ingenuity knowledge database. RESULTS: A
      total of 1952 DEGs in the Alzheimer patient cohort and 101 DEGs were identified
      in ADT treated prostate cancer patients. Comparing both data sets provided a
      subset of 33 commonly expressed genes involving cytokine-cytokine signaling with 
      an over representation of cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, inflammatory
      cytokines, signaling by interleukins together with alterations in the circulating
      lymphocyte repertoire, adaptive immune responses, regulation of cytokine
      production, and changes in T-cell subsets. Additionally, lipopolysaccharide,
      tumor necrosis factor, and toll-like receptors were identified as upstream
      transcriptional regulators of these pathways. The most commonly expressed genes
      viz. IL-17A, CCL2, IL-10, IL-6, IL-1RN, LIF/LIFR were further validated by
      quantitative RT-PCR exhibited higher expression in antiandrogen treated neuronal,
      glial, and androgen-responsive prostate cancer cells, compared to no-androgen
      antagonist treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that changes in cytokine 
      signaling under the influence of ADT in prostate cancer patients may be linked

TI  - Differences in aphasia syndromes between progressive supranuclear
      palsy-Richardson's syndrome, behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia and
      Alzheimer's dementia.
PG  - 1039-1048

AB  - Language impairments, hallmarks of speech/language variant progressive
      supranuclear palsy, also occur in Richardson's syndrome (PSP-RS). Impaired
      communication may interfere with daily activities. Therefore, assessment of
      language functions is crucial. It is uncertain whether the Aachen Aphasia Test
      (AAT) is practicable in PSP-RS, behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia
      (bvFTD) and Alzheimer's dementia (AD) and language deficits differ in these
      disorders. 28 PSP-RS, 24 AD, and 24 bvFTD patients were investigated using the
      AAT and the CERAD-Plus battery. 16-25% of all patients failed in AAT subtests for
      various reasons. The AAT syndrome algorithm diagnosed amnestic aphasia in 5 (23%)
      PSP-RS, 7 (36%) bvFTD and 6 (30%) AD patients, Broca aphasia in 1 PSP-RS and 1
      bvFTD patient, Wernicke aphasia in 1 bvFTD and 3 (15%) AD patients. However,
      aphasic symptoms resembled non-fluent primary progressive aphasia in 14 PSP-RS
      patients. In up to 46% of PSP-RS patients, 61% of bvFTD and 64% of AD patients
      significant impairments were found in the AAT subtests spontaneous speech,
      written language, naming, language repetition, language comprehension and the
      Token subtest. The CERAD-Plus subtest semantic fluency revealed significant
      impairment in 81% of PSP-RS, 61% of bvFTD, 44% of AD patients, the phonemic
      fluency subtest in 31, 40 and 31%, respectively. In contrast to bvFTD and AD,
      severity of language impairment did not correlate with cognitive decline in
      PSP-RS. In summary, the patterns of aphasia differ between the diagnoses. Local
      frontal language networks might be impaired in PSP-RS, whereas in AD and bvFTD,
      more widespread neuropathology might underly language impairment.

TI  - The impact of subthreshold levels of amyloid deposition on conversion to dementia
      in patients with amyloid-negative amnestic mild cognitive impairment.
PG  - 93
LID - 10.1186/s13195-022-01035-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: About 40-50% of patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment
      (MCI) are found to have no significant Alzheimer's pathology based on amyloid PET
      positivity. Notably, conversion to dementia in this population is known to occur 
      much less often than in amyloid-positive MCI. However, the relationship between
      MCI and brain amyloid deposition remains largely unknown. Therefore, we
      investigated the influence of subthreshold levels of amyloid deposition on
      conversion to dementia in amnestic MCI patients with negative amyloid PET scans. 
      METHODS: This study was a retrospective cohort study of patients with
      amyloid-negative amnestic MCI who visited the memory clinic of Asan Medical
      Center. All participants underwent detailed neuropsychological testing, brain
      magnetic resonance imaging, and [(18)F]-florbetaben (FBB) positron emission
      tomography scan (PET). Conversion to dementia was determined by a neurologist
      based on a clinical interview with a detailed neuropsychological test or a
      decline in the Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Examination score of more 
      than 4 points per year combined with impaired activities of daily living.
      Regional cortical amyloid levels were calculated, and a receiver operating
      characteristic (ROC) curve for conversion to dementia was obtained. To increase
      the reliability of the results of the study, we analyzed the Alzheimer's Disease 
      Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset together. RESULTS: During the follow-up
      period, 36% (39/107) of patients converted to dementia from amnestic MCI. The
      dementia converter group displayed increased standardized uptake value ratio
      (SUVR) values of FBB on PET in the bilateral temporal, parietal, posterior
      cingulate, occipital, and left precuneus cortices as well as increased global
      SUVR. Among volume of interests, the left parietal SUVR predicted conversion to
      dementia with the highest accuracy in the ROC analysis (area under the curve
      [AUC] = 0.762, P < 0.001). The combination of precuneus, parietal cortex, and FBB
      composite SUVRs also showed a higher accuracy in predicting conversion to
      dementia than other models (AUC = 0.763). Of the results of ADNI data, the SUVR
      of the left precuneus SUVR showed the highest AUC (AUC = 0.596, P = 0.006).
      CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that subthreshold amyloid levels may contribute 
      to conversion to dementia in patients with amyloid-negative amnestic MCI.

TI  - MicroRNA-22-3p ameliorates Alzheimer's disease by targeting SOX9 through the
      NF-kappaB signaling pathway in the hippocampus.
PG  - 180
LID - 10.1186/s12974-022-02548-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies have suggested that many down-regulated miRNAs identified in 
      the brain tissue or serum of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients were involved in
      the formation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Specifically, our
      previous study revealed that microRNA-22-3p (miR-22-3p) was significantly
      down-regulated in AD patients. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the
      down-regulation of miR-22-3p has not been comprehensively investigated. METHODS: 
      The ameliorating effect of miR-22-3p on apoptosis of the Abeta-treated HT22 cells
      was detected by TUNEL staining, flow cytometry, and western blotting. The
      cognition of mice with stereotaxic injection of agomir or antagomir of miR-22-3p 
      was assessed by Morris water maze test. Pathological changes in the mouse
      hippocampus were analyzed using hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, Nissl
      staining, and immunohistochemistry. Proteomics analysis was performed to identify
      the targets of miR-22-3p, which were further validated using dual-luciferase
      reporter analysis and western blotting analysis. RESULTS: The miR-22-3p played an
      important role in ameliorating apoptosis in the Abeta-treated HT22 cells.
      Increased levels of miR-22-3p in the mouse hippocampus improved the cognition in 
      mice. Although the miR-22-3p did not cause the decrease of neuronal loss in the
      hippocampus, it reduced the Abeta deposition. Proteomics analysis revealed Sox9
      protein as the target of miR-22-3p, which was verified by the luciferase reporter
      experiments. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that miR-22-3p could improve apoptosis 
      and reduce Abeta deposition by acting on Sox9 through the NF-kappaB signaling
      pathway to improve the cognition in AD mice. We concluded that miR-22-3p
      ameliorated AD by targeting Sox9 through the NF-kappaB signaling pathway in the
      hippocampus.

TI  - Phenazopyridine promotes RPS23RG1/Rps23rg1 transcription and ameliorates
      Alzheimer-associated phenotypes in mice.
LID - 10.1038/s41386-022-01373-7 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia with no effective
      treatment options. A complete elucidation of its underlying molecular mechanisms,
      including the transcription regulation of genes critically involved in AD, may
      shed light on new therapeutic development. RPS23RG1 is a newly identified
      AD-associated gene, whose expression is decreased in AD and restoration can
      attenuate AD-like phenotypes in animal models. However, the transcription
      regulation of RPS23RG1 remains unknown. In this study, we explored the promoter
      of RPS23RG1 and identified its transcription initiation site (TSS) at 1525 bp
      upstream of the ATG translation start codon. Progressive deletion analysis
      determined the presence of a negative regulatory region and a positive regulatory
      region within nucleotide positions +1127 to +1187 and +732 to +1127 relative to
      the TSS (+1), respectively. We conducted a reporter system to screen for
      compounds that increase RPS23RG1 expression through antagonizing its negative
      regulatory elements and identified phenazopyridine. Importantly, we demonstrated 
      that phenazopyridine not only promoted RPS23RG1/Rps23rg1 expression, but also
      reduced AD-like pathologies and cognitive impairments in the APP/PS1 AD model
      mice. We also determined a critical negative regulatory domain of RPS23RG1 within
      nucleotide positions +1177 to +1187 and found that the transcription factor SMAD3
      bound to this domain. Inhibition of SMAD3 promoted RPS23RG1 expression. Moreover,
      phenazopyridine reduced SMAD3 binding to the RPS23RG1 promoter without affecting 
      SMAD3 phosphorylation and nuclear localization. Taken together, our results
      determine the transcription regulation mechanism of RPS23RG1 and show that
      phenazopyridine has potential for AD treatment through regulating RPS23RG1
      transcription.

TI  - Modulation of C5a-C5aR1 signaling alters the dynamics of AD progression.
PG  - 178
LID - 10.1186/s12974-022-02539-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The complement system is part of the innate immune system that clears
      pathogens and cellular debris. In the healthy brain, complement influences
      neurodevelopment and neurogenesis, synaptic pruning, clearance of neuronal blebs,
      recruitment of phagocytes, and protects from pathogens. However, excessive
      downstream complement activation that leads to generation of C5a, and C5a
      engagement with its receptor C5aR1, instigates a feed-forward loop of
      inflammation, injury, and neuronal death, making C5aR1 a potential therapeutic
      target for neuroinflammatory disorders. C5aR1 ablation in the Arctic (Arc) model 
      of Alzheimer's disease protects against cognitive decline and neuronal injury
      without altering amyloid plaque accumulation. METHODS: To elucidate the effects
      of C5a-C5aR1 signaling on AD pathology, we crossed Arc mice with a
      C5a-overexpressing mouse (ArcC5a+) and tested hippocampal memory. RNA-seq was
      performed on hippocampus and cortex from Arc, ArcC5aR1KO, and ArcC5a+ mice at
      2.7-10 months and age-matched controls to assess mechanisms involved in each
      system. Immunohistochemistry was used to probe for protein markers of microglia
      and astrocytes activation states. RESULTS: ArcC5a+ mice had accelerated cognitive
      decline compared to Arc. Deletion of C5ar1 delayed or prevented the expression of
      some, but not all, AD-associated genes in the hippocampus and a subset of
      pan-reactive and A1 reactive astrocyte genes, indicating a separation between
      genes induced by amyloid plaques alone and those influenced by C5a-C5aR1
      signaling. Biological processes associated with AD and AD mouse models, including
      inflammatory signaling, microglial cell activation, and astrocyte migration, were
      delayed in the ArcC5aR1KO hippocampus. Interestingly, C5a overexpression also
      delayed the increase of some AD-, complement-, and astrocyte-associated genes,
      suggesting the possible involvement of neuroprotective C5aR2. However, these
      pathways were enhanced in older ArcC5a+ mice compared to Arc.
      Immunohistochemistry confirmed that C5a-C5aR1 modulation in Arc mice delayed the 
      increase in CD11c-positive microglia, while not affecting other pan-reactive
      microglial or astrocyte markers. CONCLUSION: C5a-C5aR1 signaling in AD largely
      exerts its effects by enhancing microglial activation pathways that accelerate
      disease progression. While C5a may have neuroprotective effects via C5aR2,
      engagement of C5a with C5aR1 is detrimental in AD models. These data support
      specific pharmacological inhibition of C5aR1 as a potential therapeutic strategy 
      to treat AD.

TI  - Multidomain trials to prevent dementia: addressing methodological challenges.
PG  - 94
LID - 10.1186/s13195-022-01036-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multidomain trials to prevent dementia by simultaneously targeting
      multiple risk factors with non-pharmacological lifestyle interventions show
      promise. Designing trials to evaluate the efficacy of individual interventions
      and their combinations is methodologically challenging. Determining the efficacy 
      is, nevertheless, important to individuals, payers, and for resource allocations 
      to support intervention implementation. MAIN BODY: The central rationale for
      seminal trials improving cardiovascular health or reducing falls risk in older
      adults is that multifactorial conditions may be amenable to improvement by
      simultaneously targeting multiple modifiable risk factors. Similar reasoning
      underlies lifestyle interventions to reduce dementia risk using combinations of
      physical exercise, cognitive training, diet, amelioration of vascular-metabolic
      risk factors, and improving sleep quality. Randomizing individuals with at least 
      two modifiable risk factors to "standardly tailored" interventions to mitigate
      their risk factors, versus a comparator arm, will yield an unbiased estimate of
      the cumulative average effect of modifying more versus fewer risk factors. The
      between-group difference in the cognitive primary outcome will reflect both the
      main effects of the mitigated risk factors, as well as their synergistic effects.
      However, given the positive trial results, there are inherent challenges in
      quantifying post hoc which components, or combination of components, were
      responsible for improvements in cognition. Here, we elaborate on these
      methodological challenges and important considerations in using a standardly
      tailored design with two arms (one consisting of multidomain interventions
      tailored to participants' risk profiles and another consisting of active control 
      conditions). We compare this approach to fully factorial designs and highlight
      the disadvantages and advantages of each. We discuss partial solutions, including
      analytical strategies such as risk reduction scores that measure reductions in
      the number or severity of risk factors in each study arm. Positive results can
      support the causal inference that between-group differences in the primary
      cognitive outcome were due to risk factor modification. CONCLUSION: Standardly
      tailored designs are pragmatic and feasible evaluations of multidomain
      interventions to reduce dementia risk. We propose sensitivity and exploratory
      analyses of between-group reductions in the severity of risk factors, as a
      methodology to bolster causal inferences that between-group differences in the
      primary cognitive outcome are due to the risk factors modified.

TI  - Cannabinoid extract in microdoses ameliorates mnemonic and nonmnemonic
      Alzheimer's disease symptoms: a case report.
PG  - 277
LID - 10.1186/s13256-022-03457-w [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cannabinoid-based therapy has been shown to be promising and is
      emerging as crucial for the treatment of cognitive deficits, mental illnesses,
      and many diseases considered incurable. There is a need to find an appropriate
      therapy for Alzheimer's disease, and cannabinoid-based therapy appears to be a
      feasible possibility. CASE PRESENTATION: This report addresses the beneficial
      effect of cannabinoids in microdoses on improving memory and brain functions of a
      patient with mild-stage Alzheimer's disease. The patient is a 75-year-old white
      man presenting with main symptoms of memory deficit, spatial and temporal
      disorientation, and limited daily activity. The experimental therapeutic
      intervention was carried out for 22 months with microdoses of a cannabis extract 
      containing cannabinoids. Clinical evaluations using Mini-Mental State Examination
      and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale were performed.
      CONCLUSIONS: Here we provide original evidence that cannabinoid microdosing could
      be effective as an Alzheimer's disease treatment while preventing major side
      effects. This is an important step toward dissociating cannabinoids'
      health-improving effects from potential narcotic-related limitations.

AB  - AIMS: Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) is caused by frontal-temporal lobar
      degeneration (FTLD), characterized mainly by brain protein aggregates of tau
      (FTLD-Tau) or TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP). The clinicopathological heterogeneity makes
      ante-mortem diagnosis of these pathological subtypes challenging. Our proteomics 
      study showed increased Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) levels in CSF from FTD patients,
      which was prominently expressed in FTLD-Tau. We aimed to understand APOL1
      expression in FTLD post-mortem brain tissue and to validate its potential as a
      CSF biomarker for FTD and its pathological subtypes. METHODS: APOL1 levels were
      analyzed in the frontal cortex of FTLD (including FTLD-Tau and FTLD-TDP) and
      non-demented controls by immunohistochemistry (FTLD total = 18 (12 FTLD-Tau and 6
      FTLD-TDP); controls = 9), western blot (WB), and a novel prototype ELISA (FTLD
      total = 44 (21 FTLD-Tau and 23 FTLD-TDP); controls = 9). The association of APOL1
      immunoreactivity with phosphorylated Tau (pTau) and TDP-43 (pTDP-43)
      immunoreactivity was assessed. CSF APOL1 was analyzed in confirmed FTD patients
      (n = 27, including 12 FTLD-Tau and 15 FTLD-TDP) and controls (n = 15) using the
      same ELISA. RESULTS: APOL1 levels were significantly increased in FTLD
      post-mortem tissue compared to controls as measured by immunohistochemistry, WB, 
      and ELISA. However, no differences between the pathological subtypes were
      observed. APOL1 immunoreactivity was present in neuronal and glial cells but did 
      not co-localize with pTau or pTDP-43. CSF APOL1 levels were comparable between
      FTD patients and controls and between pathological subtypes. CONCLUSION: APOL1 is
      upregulated in FTLD pathology irrespective of the subtypes, indicating a role of 
      this novel protein in FTD pathophysiology. The APOL1 levels detected in brain
      tissue were not mirrored in the CSF, limiting its potential as a specific FTD
      biofluid-based biomarker using our current immunoassay.

AB  - Early cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease may result in part from
      synaptic dysfunction caused by the accumulation oligomeric assemblies of amyloid 
      beta-protein (Abeta). Changes in hippocampal function seem critical for cognitive
      impairment in early Alzheimer's disease (AD). Diffusible oligomers of Abeta
      (oAbeta) have been shown to block canonical long-term potentiation (LTP) in the
      CA1 area of hippocampus, but whether there is also a direct effect of oAbeta on
      synaptic transmission and plasticity at synapses between mossy fibers (axons)
      from the dentate gyrus granule cells and CA3 pyramidal neurons (mf-CA3 synapses) 
      is unknown. Studies in APP transgenic mice have suggested an age-dependent
      impairment of mossy fiber LTP. Here we report that although endogenous AD
      brain-derived soluble oAbeta had no effect on mossy-fiber basal transmission, it 
      strongly impaired paired-pulse facilitation in the mossy fiber pathway and
      presynaptic mossy fiber LTP (mf-LTP). Selective activation of both beta1 and
      beta2 adrenergic receptors and their downstream cAMP/PKA signaling pathway
      prevented oAbeta-mediated inhibition of mf-LTP. Unexpectedly, activation of the
      cGMP/PKG signaling pathway also prevented oAbeta-impaired mf-LTP. Our results
      reveal certain specific pharmacological targets to ameliorate human
      oAbeta-mediated impairment at the mf-CA3 synapse.

      and their ability to predict positron emission tomography amyloid positivity.
LID - 10.1002/alz.12697 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This report details the approach taken to providing a dataset
      allowing for analyses on the performance of recently developed assays of amyloid 
      beta (Abeta) peptides in plasma and the extent to which they improve the
      prediction of amyloid positivity. METHODS: Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
      Initiative plasma samples with corresponding amyloid positron emission tomography
      (PET) data were run on six plasma Abeta assays. Statistical tests were performed 
      to determine whether the plasma Abeta measures significantly improved the area
      under the receiver operating characteristic curve for predicting amyloid PET
      status compared to age and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype. RESULTS: The age and
      APOE genotype model predicted amyloid status with an area under the curve (AUC)
      of 0.75. Three assays improved AUCs to 0.81, 0.81, and 0.84 (P < .05, uncorrected
      for multiple comparisons). DISCUSSION: Measurement of Abeta in plasma contributes
      to addressing the amyloid component of the ATN (amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration)
      framework and could be a first step before or in place of a PET or cerebrospinal 
      fluid screening study. HIGHLIGHTS: The Foundation of the National Institutes of
      Health Biomarkers Consortium evaluated six plasma amyloid beta (Abeta) assays
      using Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative samples. Three assays improved 
      prediction of amyloid status over age and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype.
      Plasma Abeta42/40 predicted amyloid positron emission tomography status better
      than Abeta42 or Abeta40 alone.

      and related dementias in the world population.
LID - 10.1002/alz.12730 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The increasing prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and related
      dementias (ADRD) presents both a burden and an opportunity for intervention. This
      study aims to estimate the impacts of health insurance and resources on the
      burden attributed to ADRD. METHOD: Data were mainly collected from global
      databases for ADRD. Analysis of variance, Pearson correlation, random-effects,
      and fixed-effects model analyses were used in this study. RESULTS: Although the
      current medical expenditures were increasing and out of pocket (OOP) expenditures
      were declining generally in various countries, the collected global data showed
      an increased burden of ADRD on patients both physically and economically.
      Furthermore, health resources were negatively associated with disability-adjusted
      life years (DALY), death, and years of life lost (YLL), but were otherwise
      positively associated with years of life lived with disability (YLD). DISCUSSION:
      Effective measures should be considered to cope with the rising burden.
      Meanwhile, there is an urgent call for constructive and sustainable rational
      plans and global collaboration. HIGHLIGHTS: We explored how health insurance and 
      resources affect Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD)-related burden.
      Health insurance and resources were imbalanced among four income level groups.
      Health insurance and resources may decrease the total ADRD burden primarily from 
      a reduction in death-related burden. Health insurance and resources may increase 
      disability-related burden.

AB  - White Matter Lesions (WML) are a radiological finding common in aged subjects. We
      explored the impact of WML on underlying neurodegenerative processes. We focused 
      on the impact of WML on two neurodegenerative diseases with different pathology. 
      In this cross-sectional study of 137 subjects (78 female, 59 men, mean age 67.2; 
      43-87 years), we compared WML in healthy controls (HC; n = 55), patients with
      Alzheimer's disease and amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI), and
      Parkinson's disease patients with normal cognition and with MCI. Subjects with AD
      and aMCI were treated as one group (n = 40), subjects with PD and PDMCI were
      another group (n = 42). MRI T2_FLAIR sequences were analyzed. WML were divided
      into periventricular (pWML) or subcortical (sWML) depending on their distance
      from the ventricles. Subjects from the AD + aMCI group, had a significantly
      greater volume of WML than both HC and the PD + PDMCI group. The volume of WML
      was greater in the PD + PDMCI than in HC but the difference was not significant. 
      In AD + aMCI subjects, sWML and not pWML were related to a decrease in global
      cognitive functioning despite greater volume of pWML. In PD + PDMCI, pWML
      correlate with decline in executive functions and working memory. In HC, pWML
      correlated with the multidomain decrease corresponding with the aging. This
      points to a difference between normal aging and pathological aging due to AD and 
      PD brain pathology. The WML location together with underlying disease related
      neurodegeneration may play a role in determining the effect of WML on cognition. 
      Our results suggest that the impact of WML is not uniform in all patients;
      rather, their volume, location and cognitive effect may be disease-specific.

      disease.
LID - 10.1007/s00401-022-02461-0 [doi]
AB  - Prion protein (PrP) aggregation and formation of PrP amyloid (APrP) are central
      events in the pathogenesis of prion diseases. In the dominantly inherited prion
      protein amyloidosis known as Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker (GSS) disease,
      plaques made of PrP amyloid are present throughout the brain. The c.593t > c
      mutation in the prion protein gene (PRNP) results in a phenylalanine to serine
      amino acid substitution at PrP residue 198 (F198S) and causes the most severe
      amyloidosis among GSS variants. It has been shown that neurodegeneration in this 
      disease is associated with the presence of extracellular APrP plaques and
      neuronal intracytoplasmic Tau inclusions, that have been shown to contain paired 
      helical filaments identical to those found in Alzheimer disease. Using cryogenic 
      electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we determined for the first time the structures of
      filaments of human APrP, isolated post-mortem from the brain of two symptomatic
      PRNP F198S mutation carriers. We report that in GSS (F198S) APrP filaments are
      composed of dimeric, trimeric and tetrameric left-handed protofilaments with
      their protomers sharing a common protein fold. The protomers in the cross-beta
      spines consist of 62 amino acids and span from glycine 80 to phenylalanine 141,
      adopting a previously unseen spiral fold with a thicker outer layer and a thinner
      inner layer. Each protomer comprises nine short beta-strands, with the beta1 and 
      beta8 strands, as well as the beta4 and beta9 strands, forming a steric zipper.
      The data obtained by cryo-EM provide insights into the structural complexity of
      the PrP filament in a dominantly inherited human PrP amyloidosis. The novel
      findings highlight the urgency of extending our knowledge of the filaments'
      structures that may underlie distinct clinical and pathologic phenotypes of human
      neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Misfolding and accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) to form senile plaques are
      the main neuropathological signatures of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Decreasing
      Abeta production, inhibiting Abeta aggregation, and clearing Abeta plaques are
      thus considered an important strategy for AD treatment. However, numerous drugs
      cannot enter the AD clinical trials due to unsatisfactory biocompatibility, poor 
      blood-brain barrier penetration, little biomarker impact, and/or low therapeutic 
      indicators. Here, a pair of chiral aspartic acid-modified
      1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (l- and d-Asp-DPPE) are prepared
      to build stabilized chiral liposomes. We find that both l- and d-liposomes are
      able to rescue Abeta aggregation-induced apoptosis, oxidative stress, and calcium
      homeostasis, in which the effect of d-liposomes is more obvious than that of
      l-ones. Furthermore, in AD model mice (APPswe/PS1d9 double-transgenic mice),
      chiral liposomes not only show biosafety but also strongly improve cognitive
      deficits and reduce Abeta deposition in the brain. Our results suggest that
      chiral liposomes, particularly, d-liposomes, could be a potential therapeutic
      approach for AD treatment. This study opens new horizons by showing that
      liposomes will be used for drug development in addition to delivery and targeting
      functions.

AB  - Metabolic brain biomarkers have been incorporated in various diagnostic
      guidelines of neurodegenerative diseases, recently. To improve their diagnostic
      accuracy a biologically and clinically homogeneous sample is needed for their
      identification. Alzheimer's disease-related pattern (ADRP) has been identified
      previously in cohorts of clinically diagnosed patients with dementia due to
      Alzheimer's disease (AD), meaning that its diagnostic accuracy might have been
      reduced due to common clinical misdiagnosis. In our study, we aimed to identify
      ADRP in a cohort of AD patients with CSF confirmed diagnosis, validate it in
      large out-of-sample cohorts and explore its relationship with patients' clinical 
      status. For identification we analyzed 2-[(18)F]FDG PET brain scans of 20 AD
      patients and 20 normal controls (NCs). For validation, 2-[(18)F]FDG PET scans
      from 261 individuals with AD, behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia, mild
      cognitive impairment and NC were analyzed. We identified an ADRP that is
      characterized by relatively reduced metabolic activity in temporoparietal
      cortices, posterior cingulate and precuneus which co-varied with relatively
      increased metabolic activity in the cerebellum. ADRP expression significantly
      differentiated AD from NC (AUC = 0.95) and other dementia types (AUC = 0.76-0.85)
      and its expression correlated with clinical measures of global cognition and
      neuropsychological indices in all cohorts.

      Alzheimer's Disease Serum Biomarker Detection.
PG  - 2075-2083
LID - 10.1021/acssensors.2c00967 [doi]
AB  - Blood-biomarker-based tests are highly important for the early clinical diagnosis
      of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the treatment and care of AD patients, but the
      complex serum environment and extremely low abundance of AD blood protein
      biomarkers present challenges. Nanomaterials are promising for constructing
      highly sensitive transistor-based biosensors due to their small size. However,
      such biosensors are difficult to fabricate on a large scale and suffer from the
      lack of combined optimization of reproducibility and sensitivity in complex
      physiological fluids. In this work, field-effect transistor (FET) biosensors
      based on highly uniform semiconducting carbon nanotube (CNT) thin films are mass 
      produced to achieve highly sensitive and selective detection of the AD core blood
      biomarkers of beta-amyloid (Abeta). The combination of the mass-produced CNT FET 
      sensors and oligonucleotide aptamers as efficient bioreceptors enables reliable
      and reproducible sub-femtomolar detection in full human serum for Abeta42 and
      Abeta40 peptides and has outperformed other methods reported to date. The
      adsorption of biological substrates to the sensor was significantly reduced by
      multiple blocking steps, resulting in selectivity ratios of up to 730% (Abeta40) 
      and 800% (Abeta42). The aptamer-functionalized CNT FET biosensor exhibits a large
      dynamic range (>10(4)), rapid response time (several minutes), and low variation 
      (<10%) and can be delivered as a low-cost and rapid clinical detection technology
      for the early diagnosis and mass screening of AD. This platform will help bring
      complex laboratory-based and expensive diagnostic tools to the point of care.

TI  - Exploring Heterogeneous Dynamical Environment around an Ensemble of Abeta42
      Peptide Monomer Conformations.
PG  - 3453-3462
LID - 10.1021/acs.jcim.2c00593 [doi]
AB  - Exploring the conformational properties of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides and the 
      role of solvent (water) in guiding the dynamical environment at their interfaces 
      is crucial for microscopic understanding of Abeta misfolding, which is involved
      in causing the most common neurodegenerative disorder, i.e., Alzheimer's disease.
      While numerous studies in the past have emphasized examining the conformational
      states of Abeta peptides, the role of water has not received much attention.
      Here, we have performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of several
      full-length Abeta42 peptide monomers with different initial configurations. Our
      efforts are directed toward probing the origin of the heterogeneous dynamics of
      water around various segments of the Abeta peptide, identified as the two
      terminal segments (N-term and C-term) and the two hydrophobic segments (hp1 and
      hp2), along with the central turn region interconnecting hp1 and hp2. Our results
      revealed that water hydrating hp1, hp2, and turn (nonterminal segments) and
      C-term segments exhibit nonuniformly restricted translational as well as
      rotational motions. The degree of such restriction has been found to be
      correlated with the hydrogen bond relaxation time scales at the interface.
      Importantly, it is revealed that the water molecules around hp1 and, to some
      extent, around hp2, form relatively rigid hydration layers, compared to that
      around the other segments. Such rigid hydration layers arise due to relatively
      more solid-like caging motions resulting in relatively lesser hydration entropy. 
      As hp1 and hp2 have been demonstrated to play a central role in Abeta
      aggregation, we believe that distinct water dynamics in the vicinity of these two
      segments, as outlined in this study, can provide vital information in
      understanding the early stages of the onset of the aggregation process of such
      peptides at higher concentration that can further aid toward advances in AD
      therapeutics.

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases involving pathological tau protein aggregation are
      collectively known as tauopathies and include Alzheimer's disease and Pick's
      disease. Recent studies show that the intake of tryptophan-tyrosine
      (Trp-Tyr)-related beta-lactopeptides, including beta-lactolin, attenuates
      cognitive decline in the elderly and prevents the amyloid pathology in mouse
      models of Alzheimer's disease. However, the effects of Trp-Tyr-related
      beta-lactopeptides on tau-related pathology have not been investigated. In the
      present study, we examined the effects of Trp-Tyr dipeptide intake on tauopathy
      in PS19 transgenic mice, a well-established tauopathy model. Intake of Trp-Tyr
      dipeptide improved the behavioral deficits observed in the open field test,
      prevented tau phosphorylation, and increased the dopamine turnover and
      synaptophysin expression in the frontal cortex. Levels of short-chain fatty acids
      in the cecum were lower in PS19 mice than those in wild-type mice and were
      increased by treatment with Trp-Tyr dipeptide. In addition, intake of Trp-Tyr
      dipeptide extended the lifespan of PS19 mice. These findings suggest that the
      intake of Trp-Tyr-related peptides improves tauopathy symptoms, resulting in
      improvements in behavioral deficits and longevity. Hence, the intake of
      Trp-Tyr-related peptides, including beta-lactolin, may be beneficial for
      preventing dementia.

TI  - TREM2-induced activation of microglia contributes to synaptic integrity in
      cognitively intact aged individuals with Alzheimer's neuropathology.
PG  - e13108
LID - 10.1111/bpa.13108 [doi]
AB  - The existence of individuals who remain cognitively intact despite presenting
      histopathological signs of Alzheimer's disease (AD), here referred to as
      "Nondemented with AD neuropathology" (NDAN), suggests that some mechanisms are
      triggered to resist cognitive impairment. Exposed phosphatidylserine (ePS)
      represents a neuronal "eat-me" signal involved in microglial-mediated
      phagocytosis of damaged synapses. A possible mediator of this process is TREM2, a
      microglial surface receptor activated by ligands including PS. Based on TREM2
      role in the scavenging function of microglia, we hypothesize that an efficient
      microglial phagocytosis of damaged synapses underlies synaptic resilience in
      NDAN, thus protecting from memory deficits. Using immunofluorescence microscopy, 
      we performed a comparative study of human post-mortem frontal cortices of
      aged-matched, AD and NDAN individuals. We studied the distribution of activated
      microglia (IBA1, IBA1(+) /CD68(+) cells) and phagocytic microglia-related
      proteins (TREM2, DAP12), demonstrating higher microglial activation and TREM2
      expression in NDAN versus AD. A study of the preservation of synapses around
      plaques, assessed using MAP2 and betaIII tubulin as dendritic and axonal markers,
      respectively, and PSD95 as a postsynaptic marker, revealed preserved
      axonal/dendritic structure around plaques in NDAN versus AD. Moreover, high
      levels of PSD95 around NDAN plaques and the colocalization of PSD95 with CD68
      indicated a prompt removal of damaged synapses by phagocytic microglia.
      Furthermore, Annexin V assay on aged-matched, AD and NDAN individuals
      synaptosomes revealed increased levels of ePS in NDAN, confirming damaged
      synapses engulfment. Our results suggest a higher efficiency of TREM2-induced
      phagocytic microglia in removing damaged synapses, underlying synaptic resilience
      in NDAN individuals.

TI  - Golgi-Targeted Fluorescent Probe for Imaging NO in Alzheimer's Disease.
PG  - 10256-10262
LID - 10.1021/acs.analchem.2c01885 [doi]
AB  - Nitric oxide (NO) is a crucial neurotransmitter participating in many biological 
      processes via nitrosylation reaction. NO produced in diverse subcellular regions 
      also regulates the function of cells in different manners. A Golgi apparatus is
      rich in nitric oxide synthase and may serve as a potential therapeutic target for
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, due to the lack of an effective tool, it is
      difficult to reveal the relationship between Golgi-NO and AD. Herein, we report
      Golgi-NO as the first Golgi-targeted fluorescent probe for sensing and imaging NO
      in the Golgi apparatus. The probe is designed and synthesized by incorporating
      4-sulfamoylphenylamide as a Golgi-targeted moiety to 6-carboxyrhodamine B,
      generating a fluorophore of Golgi-RhB with modifiable carboxyl, which is then
      combined with the NO recognition moiety of o-diaminobenzene. The probe shows
      superior analytical performance including accurate Golgi-targeted ability and
      high selectivity for NO. Moreover, using the probe, we disclose a significant
      increase of NO in Golgi apparatus in the AD model. This study provides a
      competent tool for studying the function and nitrosylation of NO in the Golgi
      apparatus in related diseases.

TI  - Ignoring the Experts: Implications of the FDA's Aduhelm Approval.
PG  - 108-133
LID - 10.1017/amj.2022.15 [doi]
AB  - In early June 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") granted
      Accelerated Approval to Aducanumab ("Aduhelm") for treating Alzheimer's disease. 
      The decision was immediately engulfed in controversy because the agency ignored
      the Scientific Drugs Advisory Committee's unanimous recommendation not to approve
      the drug. The FDA granted the approval based on Aduhelm's ability to lower
      beta-amyloid levels. However, the agency had not previously indicated this as a
      surrogate clinical end for the trial, and its own scientific analysis failed to
      show that amyloid changes correlate with cognitive or functional changes for
      Alzheimer's patients. This decision sets dangerous precedent and has the
      potential to transform the approval process for new drugs including, but not
      limited to, those meant to treat Alzheimer's.

AB  - In order to find molecules of natural origin with potential biological
      activities, we isolate and synthesise compounds with agarofuran skeletons
      (epoxyeudesmanes). From the seeds of Maytenus disticha and Maytenus magellanica
      we obtained six dihydro-beta-agarofurans, and by means of the Robinson annulation
      reaction we synthesised five compounds with the same skeleton. The structures
      were established on the basis of NMR, IR, and MS. The evaluated compounds showed 
      inhibitory activity on the acetylcholinesterase enzyme and on the COX enzymes.
      Compound 4 emerged as the most potent in the acetylcholinesterase inhibition
      assay with IC50 17.0 +/- 0.016 microM on acetylcholinesterase (AChE). The
      compounds evaluated were shown to be selective for AChE. The molecular docking,
      and the propidium displacement assay suggested that the compounds do not bind to 
      the active site of the enzyme AChE, but rather bind to the peripheral anionic
      site (PAS) of the enzyme, on the other hand, the natural compound 8, showed the
      best inhibitory activity on the COX-2 enzyme with an IC50 value of 0.04 +/- 0.007
      microM. The pharmacokinetic profile calculated in silico using the SWISSADME
      platform shows that these molecules could be considered as potential drugs for
      the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.

LID - 10.1016/j.cophys.2022.100532 [doi]
AB  - The brain is one of the most energetically demanding tissues in the human body,
      and mitochondrial pathology is strongly implicated in chronic neurodegenerative
      diseases. In contrast to acute brain injuries in which bioenergetics and cell
      death play dominant roles, studies modeling familial neurodegeneration implicate 
      a more complex and nuanced relationship involving the entire mitochondrial life
      cycle. Recent literature on mitochondrial mechanisms in Parkinson's disease,
      Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington's disease, and
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is reviewed with an emphasis on mitochondrial
      quality control, transport and synaptodendritic calcium homeostasis. Potential
      neuroprotective interventions include targeting the mitochondrial kinase

AB  - Alzheimer's disease is the neuro disorder which characterized by means of
      Amyloid- beta (A beta) in brain. However, accurate detection of this disease is a
      challenging task since the pathological issues of brain are complex in
      identification. In this paper, the changes associated with the retinal imaging
      for Alzheimer's disease are classified into two classes such as wild-type (WT)
      and transgenic mice model (TMM). For testing, optical coherence tomography (OCT) 
      images are used to classify into two groups. The classification is implemented by
      support vector machines with the optimum kernel selection using a genetic
      algorithm. Among several kernel functions of SVM, the radial basis kernel
      function provides the better classification result. In order to deal with an
      effective classification using SVM, texture features of retinal images are
      extracted and selected. The overall accuracy reached 92% and 91% of precision for
      the classification of transgenic mice.

AB  - Preclinical studies indicate that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) 
      have beneficial effects on Alzheimer-related pathologies. Therefore, the aim of
      this study was to evaluate the influence of SSRI-treatment on amyloid burden in
      (18)F-Florbetapir-positron emission tomography (PET) and on cognition in
      cognitively normal and cognitively impaired subjects. We included n = 755
      cognitively impaired and n = 394 cognitively normal participants from the
      Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) that underwent at least one
      (18)F-Florbetapir-PET. Standardized uptake ratios (SUVR) and the Alzheimer
      Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS) scores as well as follow-up
      results were compared between subgroups with a history of SSRI-treatment (SSRI+) 
      and without SSRI-treatment (SSRI-) as well as in subgroups of SSRI+/Depression+
      and SSRI+/Depression- and SSRI-/Depression+ and SSRI-/Depression-.
      (18)F-Florbetapir-PET did not show significant differences of SUVR between the
      SSRI+ and SSRI- groups in both, cognitively impaired and cognitively normal
      participants. There were no differences in subgroups of SSRI+/Depression+ and
      SSRI+/Depression- and SSRI-/Depression+ and SSRI-/Depression-. However, SUVR
      showed a dose-dependent inverse correlation to the duration of medication in
      cognitively normal and in cognitively impaired patients. SRRI-treatment did not
      show an effect on ADAS scores. Furthermore, there was no effect on follow-up SUVR
      or on follow-up ADAS scores. Overall, SSRI-treatment did not show beneficial
      effects on amyloid load nor on cognition.

AB  - Alzheimer disease (AD) is associated with the aggregation of two amyloid
      proteins: tau and amyloid-beta (Abeta). The results of immunotherapies have shown
      that enhancing the clearance and suppressing the aggregation of these two
      proteins are effective therapeutic strategies for AD. We have developed
      photocatalysts that attach oxygen atoms to Abeta and tau aggregates via light
      irradiation. Photo-oxygenation of these amyloid aggregates reduced their
      neurotoxicity by suppressing their aggregation both in vitro and in vivo.
      Furthermore, photo-oxygenation enhanced the clearance of Abeta in the brain and
      microglial cells. Here, we describe the effects of photo-oxygenation on tau and
      Abeta aggregation, and the potential of photo-oxygenation as a therapeutic
      strategy for AD, acting via microglial clearance.

PG  - 909582

AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the influence of 24-h ambulatory blood
      pressure (BP) on cognitive function and neuropathological biomarkers in patients 
      with Alzheimer's disease (AD) at the stages of mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
      and dementia. Methods: The patients with AD were divided into the MCI (AD-MCI)
      group and the dementia (AD-D) group. Notably, 24-h BP variables, including BP
      level, coefficient of variation (CV) of BP, and pulse pressure, were collected
      and compared between the two groups. The correlations between 24-h BP variables
      and the scores of cognitive domains were analyzed. The independent influencing
      factors of cognitive domains of patients with AD were investigated. The levels of
      neuropathological biomarkers of AD, including beta amyloid (Abeta)1-42,
      phosphorylated tau (P-tau), and total tau (T-tau), in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
      were measured and compared between the two groups, and the correlations between
      24-h BP variables and the levels of neuropathological biomarkers of AD were
      analyzed. Results: Daytime CV of systolic BP (SBP) was significantly increased in
      the AD-D group compared to that in the AD-MCI group. The 24-h and daytime CV of
      SBP and ambulatory pulse pressure were significantly and negatively correlated
      with memory score. The average 24-h and average daytime SBP level and CV of SBP, 
      daytime CV of diastolic BP (DBP), and 24-h, daytime, and night-time ambulatory
      pulse pressure were significantly and negatively correlated with language score. 
      The average 24-h SBP level, daytime CV of SBP, and 24-h, daytime, and night-time 
      ambulatory pulse pressure were significantly and negatively correlated with
      attention score. Further analysis indicated that daytime CV of SBP as well as age
      and course of disease were the independent influencing factors of language. Age
      was also the independent influencing factor of memory and attention of patients
      with AD. T-tau level in CSF in the AD-D group was significantly higher than that 
      in the AD-MCI group, but the levels of Abeta1-42, P-tau, and T-tau in CSF were
      not correlated with 24-h ambulatory BP variables. Conclusion: Daytime CV of SBP
      was the independent influencing factor of language in patients with AD. The AD-D 
      patients had significantly severe neurodegeneration than AD-MCI patients, which
      was, however, not through the influence of 24-h ambulatory BP variables on
      neuropathological biomarkers of AD.

      cognitively intact elders.
PG  - fcac162
LID - 10.1093/braincomms/fcac162 [doi]
AB  - The posterior cingulate cortex, a key hub of the default mode network, underlies 
      autobiographical memory retrieval and displays hypometabolic changes early in
      Alzheimer disease. To obtain an unbiased understanding of the molecular
      pathobiology of the aged posterior cingulate cortex, we performed RNA sequencing 
      (RNA-seq) on tissue obtained from 26 participants of the Rush Religious Orders
      Study (11 males/15 females; aged 76-96 years) with a pre-mortem clinical
      diagnosis of no cognitive impairment and post-mortem neurofibrillary tangle Braak
      Stages I/II, III, and IV. Transcriptomic data were gathered using next-generation
      sequencing of RNA extracted from posterior cingulate cortex generating an average
      of 60 million paired reads per subject. Normalized expression of RNA-seq data was
      calculated using a global gene annotation and a microRNA profile. Differential
      expression (DESeq2, edgeR) using Braak staging as the comparison structure
      isolated genes for dimensional scaling, associative network building and
      functional clustering. Curated genes were correlated with the Mini-Mental State
      Examination and semantic, working and episodic memory, visuospatial ability, and 
      a composite Global Cognitive Score. Regulatory mechanisms were determined by
      co-expression networks with microRNAs and an overlap of transcription factor
      binding sites. Analysis revealed 750 genes and 12 microRNAs significantly
      differentially expressed between Braak Stages I/II and III/IV and an associated
      six groups of transcription factor binding sites. Inputting significantly
      different gene/network data into a functional annotation clustering model
      revealed elevated presynaptic, postsynaptic and ATP-related expression in Braak
      Stages III and IV compared with Stages I/II, suggesting these pathways are
      integral for cognitive resilience seen in unimpaired elderly subjects. Principal 
      component analysis and Kruskal-Wallis testing did not associate Braak stage with 
      cognitive function. However, Spearman correlations between genes and cognitive
      test scores followed by network analysis revealed upregulation of classes of
      synaptic genes positively associated with performance on the visuospatial
      perceptual orientation domain. Upregulation of key synaptic genes suggests a role
      for these transcripts and associated synaptic pathways in cognitive resilience
      seen in elders despite Alzheimer disease pathology and dementia.

TI  - NAV3 Is a Novel Prognostic Biomarker Affecting the Immune Status of the Tumor

AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in the world. 
      Tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a crucial role in the development of CRC. With
      the deep understanding of TME function, growing studies have demonstrated that
      alteration in tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TICs) and gene expressions are
      associated with clinical outcomes of various tumors. In this study, we aimed to
      recognize critical prognostic genes involved in immune states in TME of CRC.
      Hence, the proportion of TICs and the number of immune and stromal components in 
      CRC samples from TCGA datasets were calculated by the use of CIBERSORT and
      ESTIMATE calculation methods. Different assays were applied to collect
      differential expression genes (DEGs) shared by the ImmuneScore and StromalScore. 
      DEGs were further analyzed by the use of univariate Cox regression. Our attention
      focused on neuron navigator 3 (NAV3) which was highly expressed in CRC specimens 
      and associated with an advanced clinical stage and poor prognosis of CRC
      patients. KEGG assays revealed that NAV3 may be involved in Alzheimer disease,
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington disease, FoxO signaling pathway, and
      human papillomavirus infection. Correlation assays showed that macrophage M0 and 
      B cells memory, NK cells activated, dendritic cells resting, T cells CD4 memory
      activated, and T cells CD8 were correlated with NAV3 expression, indicating that 
      NAV3 may represent the immune status of TME. Finally, RT-PCR confirmed that NAV3 
      expression was distinctly increased in CRC cells, and its knockdown suppressed
      the proliferation of CRC cells. Overall, NAV3 could be used as a novel predictor 
      for TME of CRC and might be a novel prognostic biomarker. In the future, drugs
      targeting NAV3 might be developed as a potential immunotherapy for CRC patients.

      Cell Co-Cultures by a Microbiome-Derived Lipopolysaccharide-Induced miRNA-30b-5p.
PG  - 900048
LID - 10.3389/fneur.2022.900048 [doi]
AB  - Microbiome-derived Gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has been
      shown by multiple laboratories to reside within Alzheimer's disease (AD)-affected
      neocortical and hippocampal neurons. LPS and other pro-inflammatory stressors
      strongly induce a defined set of NF-kB (p50/p65)-sensitive human microRNAs,
      including a brain-enriched Homo sapien microRNA-30b-5p (hsa-miRNA-30b-5p;
      miRNA-30b). Here we provide evidence that this neuropathology-associated miRNA,
      known to be upregulated in AD brain and LPS-stressed human neuronal-glial (HNG)
      cells in primary culture targets the neurofilament light (NF-L) chain mRNA
      3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR), which is conducive to the post-transcriptional
      downregulation of NF-L expression observed within both AD and LPS-treated HNG
      cells. A deficiency of NF-L is associated with consequent atrophy of the neuronal
      cytoskeleton and the disruption of synaptic organization. Interestingly,
      miRNA-30b has previously been shown to be highly expressed in amyloid-beta
      (Abeta) peptide-treated animal and cell models, and Abeta peptides promote LPS
      entry into neurons. Increased miRNA-30b expression induces neuronal injury,
      neuron loss, neuronal inflammation, impairment of synaptic transmission, and
      synaptic failure in neurodegenerative disease and transgenic murine models. This 
      gut microbiota-derived LPS-NF-kB-miRNA-30b-NF-L pathological signaling network:
      (i) underscores a positive pathological link between the LPS of gastrointestinal 
      (GI)-tract microbes and the inflammatory neuropathology, disordered cytoskeleton,
      and disrupted synaptic signaling of the AD brain and stressed brain cells; and
      (ii) is the first example of a microbiome-derived neurotoxic glycolipid having
      significant detrimental miRNA-30b-mediated actions on the expression of NF-L, an 
      abundant neuron-specific filament protein known to be important in the
      maintenance of neuronal cell shape, axonal caliber, and synaptic homeostasis.

AB  - Introduction: COVID-19 might affect the incidence of specific neurological
      diseases, but it is unknown if this differs from the risk following other
      infections. Here, we characterized the frequency of neurodegenerative,
      cerebrovascular, and immune-mediated neurological diseases after COVID-19
      compared to individuals without COVID-19 and those with other respiratory tract
      infections. Methods: This population-based cohort study utilized electronic
      health records covering ~50% of Denmark's population (n = 2,972,192). Between
      02/2020 and 11/2021, we included individuals tested for COVID-19 or diagnosed
      with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia in hospital-based facilities.
      Additionally, we included individuals tested for influenza in the corresponding
      pre-pandemic period between 02/ 2018 and 11/2019. We stratified cohorts for in-
      and outpatient status, age, sex, and comorbidities. Results: In total, 919,731
      individuals were tested for COVID-19, of whom 43,375 tested positive (35,362
      outpatients, 8,013 inpatients). Compared to COVID-negative outpatients, COVID-19 
      positive outpatients had an increased RR of Alzheimer's disease (RR = 3.5; 95%CI:
      2.2-5.5) and Parkinson's disease (RR = 2.6; 95%CI: 1.7-4.0), ischemic stroke (RR 
      = 2.7; 95%CI: 2.3-3.2) and intracerebral hemorrhage (RR = 4.8; 95%CI: 1.8-12.9). 
      However, when comparing to other respiratory tract infections, only the RR for
      ischemic stroke was increased among inpatients with COVID-19 when comparing to
      inpatients with influenza (RR = 1.7; 95%CI: 1.2-2.4) and only for those >80 years
      of age when comparing to inpatients with bacterial pneumonia (RR = 2.7; 95%CI:
      1.2-6.2). Frequencies of multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, Guillain-Barre
      syndrome and narcolepsy did not differ after COVID-19, influenza and bacterial
      pneumonia. Conclusion: The risk of neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular, but not
      neuroimmune, disorders was increased among COVID-19 positive outpatients compared
      to COVID-negative outpatients. However, except for ischemic stroke, most
      neurological disorders were not more frequent after COVID-19 than after other
      respiratory infections.

AB  - Despite contributing to neurocognitive deficits, intracortical demyelination
      after traumatic brain injury (TBI) is understudied. This study uses magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) to map intracortical myelin and its change in healthy
      controls and after mild TBI (mTBI). Acute mTBI involves reductions in relative
      myelin content primarily in lateral occipital regions. Demyelination mapped ~6
      months post-injury is significantly more severe than that observed in typical
      aging (p < 0.05), with temporal, cingulate, and insular regions losing more
      myelin (30%, 20%, and 16%, respectively) than most other areas, although
      occipital regions experience 22% less demyelination. Thus, occipital regions may 
      be more susceptible to primary injury, whereas temporal, cingulate and insular
      regions may be more susceptible to later manifestations of injury sequelae. The
      spatial profiles of aging- and mTBI-related chronic demyelination overlap
      substantially; exceptions include primary motor and somatosensory cortices, where
      myelin is relatively spared post-mTBI. These features resemble those of white
      matter demyelination and cortical thinning during Alzheimer's disease, whose risk
      increases after mTBI.

      Focus on Prevalence and Natural History in Alzheimer's Disease and Frontotemporal
      Dementia.

AB  - Neuropsychiatric or behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD)
      represent a heterogeneous group of non-cognitive symptoms that are virtually
      present in all patients during the course of their disease. The aim of this study
      is to examine the prevalence and natural history of BPSD in a large cohort of
      patients with behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) in three stages: (i) pre-T0 (before the onset of the
      disease); (ii) T0 or manifested disease (from the onset to 5 years); (iii) T1 or 
      advanced (from 5 years onwards). Six hundred seventy-four clinical records of
      patients with bvFTD and 1925 with AD, from 2006 to 2018, were studied. Symptoms
      have been extracted from Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and from a checklist of
      BPSD for all periods observed. In our population, BPSD affect up to 90% of all
      dementia subjects over the course of their illness. BPSD profiles of the two
      dementia groups were similar but not identical. The most represented symptoms
      were apathy, irritability/affective lability, and agitation/aggression.
      Considering the order of appearance of neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD and bvFTD,
      mood disorders (depression, anxiety) come first than the other BPSD, with the
      same prevalence. This means that they could be an important "red flag" in
      detection of dementia. With the increase of disease severity, aberrant motor
      behavior and wandering were significantly more present in both groups.
      Differences between BPSD in AD and bvFTD resulted only in prevalence:
      Systematically, in bvFTD, all the symptoms were more represented than in AD,
      except for hallucinations, depression, anxiety, and irritability. Given their
      high frequency and impact on management and overall health care resources, BPSD
      should not be underestimated and considered as an additional important diagnostic

TI  - The recognition and management of neuropsychiatric symptoms in early Alzheimer's 
      disease: a qualitative study among Dutch memory clinic physicians.
LID - 10.1111/psyg.12874 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Timely recognition and treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS)
      in Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia may improve quality of life, reduce
      caregiver burden, and delay disease progression. However, management of NPS in
      early AD dementia remains challenging. To date, little is known about the
      specific challenges for memory clinic-based physicians. The aims of this
      qualitative study were to obtain insights regarding the recognition and treatment
      of NPS in AD dementia in the memory clinic, to identify challenges experienced by
      physicians while managing NPS, and to examine the attitudes of memory clinic
      physicians on the role of the memory clinic in the care for NPS in early AD
      dementia. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 13 physicians
      working at a memory clinic in the Netherlands (n = 7 neurologist, n = 6
      geriatrician, 46% female). The data were analyzed by two independent researchers 
      using thematic analysis. RESULTS: We observed large variation among Dutch memory 
      clinic physicians regarding care practices, expertise, and attitudes on the role 
      of the memory clinic considering NPS in AD dementia. The most prominent
      challenges that memory clinic physicians experienced while managing NPS included 
      that the outpatient setting complicates the recognition and treatment of NPS, a
      lack of experience, knowledge, and/or resources to adequately apply
      non-pharmacological interventions, and a lack of consensus among physicians on
      the role of the memory clinic in NPS recognition and management. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      identified challenges that need to be addressed to improve the early recognition 
      and adequate management of NPS in AD dementia at the memory clinic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent
      neurodegenerative diseases. Growing evidence suggested that AD is associated with
      neuroinflammation, characterized with the chronic activation of microglial cells 
      and astrocytes along with the subsequent excessive generation of the
      proinflammatory molecules. This study aimed to investigate the effect and
      molecular mechanism of Demethylenetetrahydroberberine (DMTHB) on Alzheimer's
      disease (AD). METHODS: AD mice model were made by intracranial injection of
      Abeta25-35. DMTHB (50 mg/kg or 150 mg/kg) was intragastrically administered every
      day for three weeks. Morris water maze (MWM) was applied to evaluate the capacity
      of learning and memory of mice. Pathological change and neuronal death were
      detected by HE staining Moreover, the expressions of NLRP3, ASC, Caspase 1, IL-6,
      IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and Tau in the brain tissue were measured by qRT-PCR and
      western blot. RESULTS: Our results showed that the cognition of AD mice was
      significantly improved by DMTHB administration. DMTHB inhibited the activation of
      the microglia and significantly reduced the expression of Iba-1 in the brains of 
      AD mice. In addition, DMTHB effectively suppressed the activation of NLRP3
      inflammasome induced by Abeta25-35. The results showed that the content of
      inflammatory cytokine (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6) in the brains of AD mice
      were down-regulated by DMTHB treatment. More importantly, DMTHB treatment
      significantly alleviated hippocampus neuron deformation and apoptosis.
      CONCLUSION: These results indicated that DMTHB could be a potential medicine
      against AD through regulation of neuroinflammation.

TI  - NMDA receptor antagonists reduce amyloid-beta deposition by modulating calpain-1 
      signaling and autophagy, rescuing cognitive impairment in 5XFAD mice.
PG  - 408
LID - 10.1007/s00018-022-04438-4 [doi]
AB  - Overstimulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) is the leading cause
      of brain excitotoxicity and often contributes to neurodegenerative diseases such 
      as Alzheimer's Disease (AD), the most common form of dementia. This study aimed
      to evaluate a new NMDA receptor antagonist (UB-ALT-EV) and memantine in
      6-month-old female 5XFAD mice that were exposed orally to a chronic low-dose
      treatment. Behavioral and cognitive tests confirmed better cognitive performance 
      in both treated groups. Calcium-dependent protein calpain-1 reduction was found
      after UB-ALT-EV treatment but not after memantine. Changes in spectrin breakdown 
      products (SBDP) and the p25/p35 ratio confirmed diminished calpain-1 activity.
      Amyloid beta (Abeta) production and deposition was evaluated in 5XFAD mice and
      demonstrated a robust effect of NMDAR antagonists on reducing Abeta deposition
      and the number and size of Thioflavin-S positive plaques. Furthermore, glycogen
      synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) active form and phosphorylated tau (AT8) levels 
      were diminished after UB-ALT-EV treatment, revealing tau pathology improvement.
      Because calpain-1 is involved in autophagy activation, autophagic proteins were
      studied. Strikingly, results showed changes in the protein levels of unc-51-like 
      kinase (ULK-1), beclin-1, microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain
      3(LC3B-II)/LC3B-I ratio, and lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP-1)
      after NMDAR antagonist treatments, suggesting an accumulation of
      autophagolysosomes in 5XFAD mice, reversed by UB-ALT-EV. Likewise, treatment with
      UB-ALT-EV recovered a WT mice profile in apoptosis markers Bcl-2, Bax, and
      caspase-3. In conclusion, our results revealed the potential neuroprotective
      effect of UB-ALT-EV by attenuating NMDA-mediated apoptosis and reducing Abeta
      deposition and deposition jointly with the autophagy rescue to finally reduce
      cognitive alterations in a mice model of familial AD.

AB  - Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease that
      results in a progressive decline in cognitive abilities. Since AD starts several 
      years before the onset of the symptoms, its early detection is challenging due to
      subtle changes in biomarkers mainly detectable in different neuroimaging
      modalities. Developing computer-aided diagnostic models based on deep learning
      can provide excellent opportunities for the analysis of different neuroimage
      modalities along with other non-image biomarkers. In this survey, we perform a
      comparative analysis of about 100 published papers since 2019 that employ basic
      deep architectures such as CNN, RNN, and generative models for AD diagnosis.
      Moreover, about 60 papers that have applied a trending topic or architecture for 
      AD are investigated. Explainable models, normalizing flows, graph-based deep
      architectures, self-supervised learning, and attention mechanisms are considered.
      The main challenges in this body of literature have been categorized and
      explained from data-related, methodology-related, and clinical adoption aspects. 
      We conclude our paper by addressing some future perspectives and providing
      recommendations to conduct further studies for AD diagnosis.

AB  - It is widely known that GnRH plays a role in facilitating reproductive function
      via the HPG axis, and this was once believed to be its only function. However,
      over the last several decades important neuromodulatory roles of GnRH in multiple
      brain functions have been elucidated. Multiple GnRH isoforms and receptors have
      been detected outside the HPG-axis across different species. In this review, we
      focus on the human CNS where GnRH I and II isoforms and a functional GnRH I
      receptor have been isolated. We first describe the traditional understanding of
      GnRH within the hypothalamus and the pituitary and current clinical use of GnRH
      analogues. We then review the location and function of GnRH-producing neurons and
      receptors located outside the HPG axis. We next review the GnRH I and II neuron
      location and quantity and GnRH I receptor gene expression throughout the human
      brain, using the Allen Brain Map Atlas. This analysis demonstrates a wide
      expression of GnRH throughout the brain, including prominent expression in the
      basal forebrain and cerebellum. Lastly, we examine the potential role of GnRH in 
      aging and inflammation and its therapeutic potential for neurodegenerative
      disease and spinal cord lesions.

AB  - White matter hyperintensities (WMH), a marker of small vessel cerebrovascular
      disease, increase risk of developing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). Less is known about the extent and pattern of WMH in
      pre-MCI stages, such as among those with objectively-defined subtle cognitive
      decline (Obj-SCD). Five hundred and fifty-nine Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
      Initiative participants (170 cognitively unimpaired [CU]; 83 Obj-SCD; 306 MCI)
      free of clinical dementia or stroke completed neuropsychological testing and MRI 
      exams. ANCOVA models compared cognitive groups on regional WMH adjusting for age,
      sex, and apolipoprotein E (APOE) varepsilon4 frequency. Compared with the CU
      group, those with Obj-SCD had greater temporal, occipital, and frontal WMH
      whereas those with MCI had higher WMH volume across all regions (p's < 0.01). No 
      differences in WMH volume were observed between the Obj-SCD and MCI groups (p's >
      0.05). Findings add to growing evidence of associations between Obj-SCD and
      imaging biomarkers, providing support for utility of these criteria to capture
      subtle cognitive changes that are biologically based.

TI  - Emetine and Indirubin- 3- monoxime interaction with human brain
      acetylcholinesterase: A computational and statistical analysis.
PG  - 106-114

AB  - Alzheimer's disease is a chronic neurodegenerative ailment and the most familiar 
      type of dementia in the older population with no effective cure to date. It is
      characterized by a decrease in memory, associated with the mutilation of
      cholinergic neurotransmission. Presently, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors have
      emerged as the most endorsed pharmacological medications for the symptomatic
      treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. This study aimed to research
      the molecular enzymatic inhibition of human brain acetylcholinesterase by a
      natural compound emetine and I3M. Molecular docking studies were used to identify
      superior interaction between enzyme acetylcholinesterase and ligands.
      Furthermore, the docked acetylcholinesterase-emetine complex was validated
      statistically using an analysis of variance in all tested conformers. In this
      interaction, H-bond, hydrophobic interaction, pi-pi, and Cation-pi interactions
      played a vital function in predicting the accurate conformation of the ligand
      that binds with the active site of acetylcholinesterase. The conformer with the
      lowest free energy of binding was further analyzed. The binding energy for
      acetylcholinesterase complex with emetine and I3M was -9.72kcal/mol and
      -7.09kcal/mol, respectively. In the current study, the prediction was studied to 
      establish a relationship between binding energy and intermolecular energy
      (coefficient of determination [R2 linear = 0.999), and intermolecular energy and 
      Van der wall forces (R2 linear = 0.994). These results would be useful in gaining
      structural insight for designing novel lead compounds against
      acetylcholinesterase for the effective management of Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Adherence to Mediterranean-DASH Diet Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay
      (MIND) may lower the risk of dementia by impacting immunity and cholesterol,
      which are pathways also implicated by genome-wide association studies of
      Alzheimer's Dementia (AD). We examined whether adherence to the MIND diet could
      modify the association of genetic risk for AD with incident dementia. We used
      three ongoing US cohorts: Chicago Health and Aging Project (CHAP, n = 2449), Rush
      Memory and Aging Project (MAP, n = 725), and Women's Health Initiative Memory
      Study (WHIMS, n = 5308). Diagnosis of dementia was based on clinical neurological
      examination and standardized criteria. Repeated measures of global cognitive
      function were available in MAP and CHAP. Self-reported adherence to MIND was
      estimated using food-frequency questionnaires. Global and pathway-specific
      genetic scores (GS) for AD were derived. Cox proportional hazard, logistic
      regression, and mixed models were used to examine associations of MIND, GS, and
      GS-MIND interactions with incident dementia and cognitive decline. Higher
      adherence to MIND and lower GS were associated with a lower risk of dementia in
      MAP and WHIMS and a slower rate of cognitive decline in MAP (p &lt; 0.05). MIND
      or GS were not associated with incident dementia or cognitive decline in CHAP. No
      gene-diet interaction was replicated across cohorts. Genetic risk and MIND
      adherence are independently associated with dementia among older US men and
      women.

      Metabolites in the Pathogenesis of Common Brain Diseases.
LID - 2661 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14132661 [doi]
AB  - The involvement of the gut microbiota and the metabolites of colon-residing
      bacteria in brain disease pathogenesis has been covered in a growing number of
      studies, but comparative literature is scarce. To fill this gap, we explored the 
      contribution of the microbiota-gut-brain axis to the pathophysiology of seven
      brain-related diseases (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum
      disorder, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, major
      depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder). In this article, we discussed changes
      in bacterial abundance and the metabolic implications of these changes on disease
      development and progression. Our central findings indicate that, mechanistically,
      all seven diseases are associated with a leaky gut, neuroinflammation, and
      over-activated microglial cells, to which gut-residing bacteria and their
      metabolites are important contributors. Patients show a pro-inflammatory shift in
      their colon microbiota, harbouring more Gram-negative bacteria containing
      immune-triggering lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in their cell walls. In addition,
      bacteria with pro-inflammatory properties (Alistipes, Eggerthella,
      Flavonifractor) are found in higher abundances, whereas lower abundances of
      anti-inflammatory bacteria (Bifidobacterium, Coprococcus, Eucbacterium,
      Eubacterium rectale, Faecalibacterium, Faecalibacterium prasunitzii,
      Lactobacillus, Prevotella, Roseburia) are reported, when compared to healthy
      controls. On the metabolite level, aberrant levels of short-chain fatty acids
      (SCFAs) are involved in disease pathogenesis and are mostly found in lower
      quantities. Moreover, bacterial metabolites such as neurotransmitters
      (acetylcholine, dopamine, noradrenaline, GABA, glutamate, serotonin) or amino
      acids (phenylalanine, tryptophan) also play an important role. In the future,
      defined aberrations in the abundance of bacteria strains and altered bacterial
      metabolite levels could likely be possible markers for disease diagnostics and
      follow-ups. Moreover, they could help to identify novel treatment options,
      underlining the necessity for a deeper understanding of the microbiota-gut-brain 
      axis.

TI  - Role of Natural Compounds and Target Enzymes in the Treatment of Alzheimer's
      Disease.
LID - 4175 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27134175 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological condition. The rising
      prevalence of AD necessitates the rapid development of efficient therapy options.
      Despite substantial study, only a few medications are capable of delaying the
      disease. Several substances with pharmacological activity, derived from plants,
      have been shown to have positive benefits for the treatment of AD by targeting
      various enzymes, such as acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase
      (BuChE), beta-secretase, gamma-secretase, and monoamine oxidases (MAOs), which
      are discussed as potential targets. Medicinal plants have already contributed a
      number of lead molecules to medicine development, with many of them currently
      undergoing clinical trials. A variety of medicinal plants have been shown to
      diminish the degenerative symptoms associated with AD, either in their raw form
      or as isolated compounds. The aim of this review was to provide a brief summary
      of AD and its current therapies, followed by a discussion of the natural
      compounds examined as therapeutic agents and the processes underlying the
      positive effects, particularly the management of AD.

TI  - A Class I HDAC Inhibitor Rescues Synaptic Damage and Neuron Loss in
      APP-Transfected Cells and APP/PS1 Mice through the GRIP1/AMPA Pathway.
LID - 4160 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27134160 [doi]
AB  - As a neurodegenerative disease, Alzheimer's disease (AD) seriously affects the
      health of older people. Changes in synapses occur first over the course of the
      disease, perhaps even before the formation of Abeta plaques. Histone deacetylase 
      (HDAC) mediates the damage of Abeta oligomers to dendritic spines. Therefore, we 
      examined the relationship between HDAC activity and synaptic defects using an
      HDAC inhibitor (HDACI), BG45, in the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line with
      stable overexpression of Swedish mutant APP (APPsw) and in APP/PS1 transgenic
      mice during this study. The cells were treated with 15 muM BG45 and the APP/PS1
      mice were treated with 30 mg/kg BG45. We detected the levels of synapse-related
      proteins, HDACs, tau phosphorylation, and
      amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors using Western
      blotting and immunohistochemistry. We also measured the expression of
      cytoskeletal proteins in the cell model. The mRNA levels of the glutamate ion
      receptor alginate subunit 2 (GRIK2), sodium voltage-gated channel beta subunit
      (SCN3B), synaptophysin (SYP), Grm2 (the gene encoding glutamate receptor subunit 
      2 (GluR2)), Grid2IP, glutamate receptor interacting protein 1 (GRIP1), and GRIP2 
      were detected to explore the effects of the HDACI on regulating the expression of
      synaptic proteins and AMPA receptors. According to our studies, the expressions
      of HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 were increased, which were accompanied by the
      downregulation of the synapse-related proteins SYP, postsynaptic dendritic
      protein (PSD-95), and spinophilin as early as 24 h after transfection with the
      APPsw gene. BG45 upregulated the expression of synapse-related proteins and
      repaired cytoskeletal damage. In vivo, BG45 alleviated the apoptosis-mediated
      loss of hippocampal neurons, upregulated synapse-related proteins, reduced Abeta 
      deposition and phosphorylation of tau, and increased the levels of the
      synapse-related genes GRIK2, SCN3B, SYP, Grm2, and Grid2IP. BG45 increased the
      expression of the AMPA receptor subunits GluA1, GluA2, and GluA3 on
      APPsw-transfected cells and increased GRIP1 and GRIP2 expression and AMPA
      receptor phosphorylation in vivo. Based on these results, HDACs are involved in
      the early process of synaptic defects in AD models, and BG45 may rescue synaptic 
      damage and the loss of hippocampal neurons by specifically inhibiting HDAC1,
      HDAC2, and HDAC3, thereby modulating AMPA receptor transduction, increasing
      synapse-related gene expression, and finally enhancing the function of excitatory
      synapses. BG45 may be considered a potential drug for the treatment of early AD
      in further studies.

TI  - Targeting Microglia in Alzheimer's Disease: From Molecular Mechanisms to
      Potential Therapeutic Targets for Small Molecules.
LID - 4124 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27134124 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common, progressive, and devastating
      neurodegenerative disorder that mainly affects the elderly. Microglial
      dysregulation, amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques, and intracellular neurofibrillary
      tangles play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of AD. In the brain, microglia
      play roles as immune cells to provide protection against virus injuries and
      diseases. They have significant contributions in the development of the brain,
      cognition, homeostasis of the brain, and plasticity. Multiple studies have
      confirmed that uncontrolled microglial function can result in impaired microglial
      mitophagy, induced Abeta accumulation and tau pathology, and a chronic
      neuroinflammatory environment. In the brain, most of the genes that are
      associated with AD risk are highly expressed by microglia. Although it was
      initially regarded that microglia reaction is incidental and induced by
      dystrophic neurites and Abeta plaques. Nonetheless, it has been reported by
      genome-wide association studies that most of the risk loci for AD are located in 
      genes that are occasionally uniquely and highly expressed in microglia. This
      finding further suggests that microglia play significant roles in early AD stages
      and they be targeted for the development of novel therapeutics. In this review,
      we have summarized the molecular pathogenesis of AD, microglial activities in the
      adult brain, the role of microglia in the aging brain, and the role of microglia 
      in AD. We have also particularly focused on the significance of targeting
      microglia for the treatment of AD.

LID - 10.3390/ijms23137332 [doi]
AB  - Mass spectrometry (MS), with its immense technological developments over the last
      two decades, has emerged as an unavoidable technique in analyzing biomolecules
      such as proteins and peptides. Its multiplexing capability and explorative
      approach make it a valuable tool for analyzing complex clinical samples
      concerning biomarker research and investigating pathophysiological mechanisms.
      Peptides regulate various biological processes, and several of them play a
      critical role in many disease-related pathological conditions. One important
      example in neurodegenerative diseases is the accumulation of amyloid-beta
      peptides (Abeta) in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. When
      investigating brain function and brain-related pathologies, such as
      neurodegenerative diseases, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) represents the most
      suitable sample because of its direct contact with the brain. In this review, we 
      evaluate publications applying peptidomics analysis to CSF samples, focusing on
      neurodegenerative diseases. We describe the methodology of peptidomics analysis
      and give an overview of the achievements of CSF peptidomics over the years.
      Finally, publications reporting peptides regulated in AD are discussed.

TI  - I2-Imidazoline Ligand CR4056 Improves Memory, Increases ApoE Expression and
      Reduces BBB Leakage in 5xFAD Mice.
LID - 7320 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23137320 [doi]
AB  - Recent evidence suggests that I2-imidazoline ligands have neuroprotective
      properties in animal models of neurodegeneration, such as Alzheimer's disease
      (AD). We recently demonstrated that the I2-ligand BU224 reversed memory
      impairments in AD transgenic mice and this effect was not because of reductions
      in amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition. In this study, our aim was to determine the
      therapeutic potential of the powerful analgesic I2-imidazoline ligand CR4056 in
      the 5xFAD model of AD, since this ligand has been proven to be safely tolerated
      in humans. Sub-chronic oral administration of CR4056 (30 mg/kg for 10 days) led
      to an improvement in recognition memory in 6-month-old 5xFAD mice, but not in
      wild-type littermates, without affecting Abeta levels or deposition. Our results 
      also revealed a change in the profile of microglia by CR4056, resulting in a
      suppression of pro-inflammatory activated microglia, but increased the density of
      astrocytes and the expression of ApoE, which is mainly produced by these glial
      cells. In addition, CR4056 restored fibrinogen extravasation, affecting the
      distribution of markers of astrocytic end feet in blood vessels. Therefore, these
      results suggest that CR4056 protects against Abeta-mediated neuroinflammation and
      vascular damage, and offers therapeutic potential at any stage of AD.

TI  - Tau as a Biomarker of Neurodegeneration.
LID - 7307 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23137307 [doi]
AB  - Less than 50 years since tau was first isolated from a porcine brain, its
      detection in femtolitre concentrations in biological fluids is revolutionizing
      the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. This review highlights the molecular
      and technological advances that have catapulted tau from obscurity to the
      forefront of biomarker diagnostics. Comprehensive updates are provided describing
      the burgeoning clinical applications of tau as a biomarker of neurodegeneration. 
      For the clinician, tau not only enhances diagnostic accuracy, but holds promise
      as a predictor of clinical progression, phenotype, and response to drug therapy. 
      For patients living with neurodegenerative disorders, characterization of tau
      dysregulation could provide much-needed clarity to a notoriously murky diagnostic
      landscape.

TI  - Partial Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase Deficiency Exacerbates Cognitive
      Deficit and Amyloid Pathology in the APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 Mouse Model of Alzheimer's
      Disease.
LID - 7316 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23137316 [doi]
AB  - Increasing evidence implicates endothelial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nitric oxide (NO) derived from endothelial NO synthase 
      (eNOS) is essential in maintaining cerebrovascular function and can modulate the 
      production and clearance of amyloid beta (Abeta). APPswe/PSdE1 (APP/PS1) mice
      display age-related Abeta accumulation and memory deficits. In order to make the 
      model more clinically relevant with an element of endothelial dysfunction, we
      generated APP/PS1/eNOS(+/-) mice by crossing complete eNOS deficient (eNOS(-/-)) 
      mice and APP/PS1 mice. APP/PS1/eNOS(+/-) mice at 8 months of age displayed a more
      severe spatial working memory deficit relative to age-matched APP/PS1 mice.
      Moreover, immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting revealed significantly
      increased Abeta plaque load in the brains of APP/PS1/eNOS(+/-) mice, concomitant 
      with upregulated BACE-1 (hence increased Abeta production), downregulated
      insulin-degrading enzyme (hence reduced Abeta clearance) and increased
      immunoreactivity and expression of microglia. The present study, for the first
      time, demonstrated that partial eNOS deficiency exacerbated behavioral
      dysfunction, Abeta brain deposition, and microglial pathology in APP/PS1 mice,
      further implicating endothelial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of AD. The
      present findings also provide the scientific basis for developing preventive
      and/or therapeutic strategies by targeting endothelial dysfunction.

TI  - A Novel Neurofilament Light Chain ELISA Validated in Patients with Alzheimer's
      Disease, Frontotemporal Dementia, and Subjective Cognitive Decline, and the
      Evaluation of Candidate Proteins for Immunoassay Calibration.
LID - 7221 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23137221 [doi]
AB  - Neurofilament light chain (Nf-L) is a well-known biomarker for axonal damage;
      however, the corresponding circulating Nf-L analyte in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
      is poorly characterized. We therefore isolated new monoclonal antibodies against 
      synthetic peptides, and these monoclonals were characterized for their
      specificity on brain-specific intermediate filament proteins. Two highly specific
      antibodies, ADx206 and ADx209, were analytically validated for CSF applications
      according to well-established criteria. Interestingly, using three different
      sources of purified Nf-L proteins, a significant impact on interpolated
      concentrations was observed. With a lower limit of analytical sensitivity of 100 
      pg/mL using bovine Nf-L as the calibrator, we were able to quantify the Nf-L
      analyte in each sample, and these Nf-L concentrations were highly correlated to
      the Uman diagnostics assay (Spearman rho = 0.97, p &lt; 0.001). In the clinical
      diagnostic groups, the new Nf-L ELISA could discriminate patients with
      Alzheimer's disease (AD, n = 20) from those with frontotemporal lobe dementia
      (FTD, n = 20) and control samples with subjective cognitive decline (SCD, n =
      20). Henceforth, this novel Nf-L ELISA with well-defined specificity and epitopes
      can be used to enhance our understanding of harmonizing the use of Nf-L as a
      clinically relevant marker for neurodegeneration in CSF.

TI  - Vascular Dysfunction Is Central to Alzheimer's Disease Pathogenesis in APOE e4
      Carriers.
LID - 7106 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23137106 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and the leading risk
      factor, after age, is possession of the apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 allele
      (APOE4). Approximately 50% of AD patients carry one or two copies of APOE4 but
      the mechanisms by which it confers risk are still unknown. APOE4 carriers are
      reported to demonstrate changes in brain structure, cognition, and
      neuropathology, but findings have been inconsistent across studies. In the
      present study, we used multi-modal data to characterise the effects of APOE4 on
      the brain, to investigate whether AD pathology manifests differently in APOE4
      carriers, and to determine if AD pathomechanisms are different between carriers
      and non-carriers. Brain structural differences in APOE4 carriers were
      characterised by applying machine learning to over 2000 brain MRI measurements
      from 33,384 non-demented UK biobank study participants. APOE4 carriers showed
      brain changes consistent with vascular dysfunction, such as reduced white matter 
      integrity in posterior brain regions. The relationship between APOE4 and AD
      pathology was explored among the 1260 individuals from the Religious Orders Study
      and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP). APOE4 status had a greater effect on
      amyloid than tau load, particularly amyloid in the posterior cortical regions.
      APOE status was also highly correlated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA).
      Bulk tissue brain transcriptomic data from ROSMAP and a similar dataset from the 
      Mount Sinai Brain Bank showed that differentially expressed genes between the
      dementia and non-dementia groups were enriched for vascular-related processes
      (e.g., "angiogenesis") in APOE4 carriers only. Immune-related transcripts were
      more strongly correlated with AD pathology in APOE4 carriers with some
      transcripts such as TREM2 and positively correlated with pathology severity in
      APOE4 carriers, but negatively in non-carriers. Overall, cumulative evidence from
      the largest neuroimaging, pathology, and transcriptomic studies available
      suggests that vascular dysfunction is key to the development of AD in APOE4
      carriers. However, further studies are required to tease out non-APOE4-specific
      mechanisms.

TI  - A New Bistable Switch Model of Alzheimer's Disease Pathogenesis.
LID - 7061 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23137061 [doi]
AB  - We propose a model to explain the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) based 
      on the theory that any disease affecting a healthy organism originates from a
      bistable feedback loop that shifts the system from a physiological to a
      pathological condition. We focused on the known double inhibitory loop involving 
      the cellular prion protein (PrPC) and the enzyme BACE1 that produces amyloid-beta
      (Abeta) peptides. BACE1 is inhibited by PrPC, but its inhibitory activity is lost
      when PrPC binds to Abeta oligomers (Abetao). Excessive Abetao formation would
      switch the loop to a pathogenic condition involving the Abetao-PrPC-mGluR5
      complex, Fyn kinase activation, tau, and NMDAR phosphorylation, ultimately
      leading to neurodegeneration. Based on the emerging role of cyclic nucleotides in
      Abeta production, and thereby in synaptic plasticity and cognitive processes,
      cAMP and cGMP can be considered as modulatory factors capable of inducing the
      transition from a physiological steady state to a pathogenic one. This would
      imply that critical pharmacological targets for AD treatment lie within pathways 
      that lead to an imbalance of cyclic nucleotides in neurons. If this hypothesis is
      confirmed, it will provide precise indications for the development of preventive 
      or therapeutic treatments for the disease.

TI  - The Interplay between cGMP and Calcium Signaling in Alzheimer's Disease.
LID - 7048 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23137048 [doi]
AB  - Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) is a ubiquitous second messenger and a key 
      molecule in many important signaling cascades in the body and brain, including
      phototransduction, olfaction, vasodilation, and functional hyperemia.
      Additionally, cGMP is involved in long-term potentiation (LTP), a cellular
      correlate of learning and memory, and recent studies have identified the
      cGMP-increasing drug Sildenafil as a potential risk modifier in Alzheimer's
      disease (AD). AD development is accompanied by a net increase in the expression
      of nitric oxide (NO) synthases but a decreased activity of soluble guanylate
      cyclases, so the exact sign and extent of AD-mediated imbalance remain unclear.
      Moreover, human patients and mouse models of the disease present with entangled
      deregulation of both cGMP and Ca(2+) signaling, e.g., causing changes in
      cGMP-mediated Ca(2+) release from the intracellular stores as well as
      Ca(2+)-mediated cGMP production. Still, the mechanisms governing such interplay
      are poorly understood. Here, we review the recent data on mechanisms underlying
      the brain cGMP signaling and its interconnection with Ca(2+) signaling. We also
      discuss the recent evidence stressing the importance of such interplay for normal
      brain function as well as in Alzheimer's disease.

      Alzheimer's Disease.
LID - 6954 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23136954 [doi]
AB  - Mitochondrial dysfunction is now recognized as a contributing factor to
      neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Mitochondria are 
      signaling organelles with a variety of functions ranging from energy production
      to the regulation of cellular metabolism, energy homeostasis, and response to
      stress. The successful functioning of these complex processes is critically
      dependent on the accuracy of mitochondrial dynamics, which includes the ability
      of mitochondria to change shape and position in the cell, which is necessary to
      maintain proper function and quality control, especially in polarized cells such 
      as neurons. There has been much evidence to suggest that the disruption of
      mitochondrial dynamics may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of AD. This
      review highlights aspects of altered mitochondrial dynamics in AD that may
      contribute to the etiology of this debilitating condition. We also discuss
      therapeutic strategies to improve mitochondrial dynamics and function that may
      provide an alternative treatment approach.

TI  - Therapeutic Potential of Allicin and Aged Garlic Extract in Alzheimer's Disease.
LID - 6950 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23136950 [doi]
AB  - Garlic, Allium sativum, has long been utilized for a number of medicinal purposes
      around the world, and its medical benefits have been well documented. The health 
      benefits of garlic likely arise from a wide variety of components, possibly
      working synergistically. Garlic and garlic extracts, especially aged garlic
      extracts (AGEs), are rich in bioactive compounds, with potent anti-inflammatory, 
      antioxidant and neuroprotective activities. In light of these effects, garlic and
      its components have been examined in experimental models of Alzheimer's disease
      (AD), the most common form of dementia without therapy, and a growing health
      concern in aging societies. With the aim of offering an updated overview, this
      paper reviews the chemical composition, metabolism and bioavailability of garlic 
      bioactive compounds. In addition, it provides an overview of signaling mechanisms
      triggered by garlic derivatives, with a focus on allicin and AGE, to improve
      learning and memory.

TI  - Specific Cerebrospinal Fluid SerpinA1 Isoform Pattern in Alzheimer's Disease.
LID - 6922 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23136922 [doi]
AB  - SerpinA1 (alpha1-antitrypsin) is a soluble glycoprotein, the cerebrospinal fluid 
      (CSF) isoforms of which showed disease-specific changes in neurodegenerative
      disorders that are still unexplored in Alz-heimer's disease (AD). By means of
      capillary isoelectric focusing immunoassay, we investigated six serpinA1 isoforms
      in CSF samples of controls (n = 29), AD-MCI (n = 29), AD-dem (n = 26) and Lewy
      body disease (LBD, n = 59) patients and correlated the findings with CSF AD core 
      biomarkers (Abeta42/40 ratio, p-tau, t-tau). Four CSF serpinA1 isoforms were
      differently expressed in AD patients compared to controls and LBD patients,
      especially isoforms 2 and 4. AD-specific changes were found since the MCI stage
      and significantly correlated with decreased Abeta42/40 (p &lt; 0.05) and
      in-creased p-tau and t-tau levels in CSF (p &lt; 0.001). Analysis of serpinA1
      isoform provided good di-agnostic accuracy in discriminating AD patients versus
      controls (AUC = 0.80) and versus LBD patients (AUC = 0.92), with best results in 
      patients in the dementia stage (AUC = 0.97). SerpinA1 isoform expression is
      altered in AD patients, suggesting a common, albeit disease-specific,
      in-volvement of serpinA1 in most neurodegenerative disorders.

TI  - Establishing In-House Cutoffs of CSF Alzheimer's Disease Biomarkers for the AT(N)
      Stratification of the Alzheimer Center Barcelona Cohort.
LID - 6891 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23136891 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) increasingly
      incorporates CSF biomarkers. However, due to the intrinsic variability of the
      immunodetection techniques used to measure these biomarkers, establishing
      in-house cutoffs defining the positivity/negativity of CSF biomarkers is
      recommended. However, the cutoffs currently published are usually reported by
      using cross-sectional datasets, not providing evidence about its intrinsic
      prognostic value when applied to real-world memory clinic cases. METHODS: We
      quantified CSF Abeta1-42, Abeta1-40, t-Tau, and p181Tau with standard
      INNOTEST((R)) ELISA and Lumipulse G((R)) chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay
      (CLEIA) performed on the automated Lumipulse G600II. Determination of cutoffs
      included patients clinically diagnosed with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD, n =
      37) and subjective cognitive decline subjects (SCD, n = 45), cognitively stable
      for 3 years and with no evidence of brain amyloidosis in 18F-Florbetaben-labeled 
      positron emission tomography (FBB-PET). To compare both methods, a subset of
      samples for Abeta1-42 (n = 519), t-Tau (n = 399), p181Tau (n = 77), and Abeta1-40
      (n = 44) was analyzed. Kappa agreement of single biomarkers and
      Abeta1-42/Abeta1-40 was evaluated in an independent group of mild cognitive
      impairment (MCI) and dementia patients (n = 68). Next, established cutoffs were
      applied to a large real-world cohort of MCI subjects with follow-up data
      available (n = 647). RESULTS: Cutoff values of Abeta1-42 and t-Tau were higher
      for CLEIA than for ELISA and similar for p181Tau. Spearman coefficients ranged
      between 0.81 for Abeta1-40 and 0.96 for p181TAU. Passing-Bablok analysis showed a
      systematic and proportional difference for all biomarkers but only systematic for
      Abeta1-40. Bland-Altman analysis showed an average difference between methods in 
      favor of CLEIA. Kappa agreement for single biomarkers was good but lower for the 
      Abeta1-42/Abeta1-40 ratio. Using the calculated cutoffs, we were able to stratify
      MCI subjects into four AT(N) categories. Kaplan-Meier analyses of AT(N)
      categories demonstrated gradual and differential dementia conversion rates (p =
      9.815(-27)). Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models corroborated these
      findings, demonstrating that the proposed AT(N) classifier has prognostic value. 
      AT(N) categories are only modestly influenced by other known factors associated
      with disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: We established CLEIA and ELISA internal
      cutoffs to discriminate AD patients from amyloid-negative SCD individuals. The
      results obtained by both methods are not interchangeable but show good agreement.
      CLEIA is a good and faster alternative to manual ELISA for providing AT(N)
      classification of our patients. AT(N) categories have an impact on disease
      progression. AT(N) classifiers increase the certainty of the MCI prognosis, which
      can be instrumental in managing real-world MCI subjects.

AB  - The literature suggests that leisure walking can play an important role in
      preventing dementia. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the
      relationship between leisure walking and the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease
      (AD) and other dementias among older adults. Using the 2020 Health and Retirement
      Study (HRS), 4581 responses constituted the sample for the present study. A
      hierarchical logit regression analysis was conducted to investigate the
      relationship between leisure walking and the prevalence of AD and dementia. The
      results show that leisure walking has been negatively associated with the
      prevalence of AD and other dementias-that is, they indicate that older adults who
      frequently engaged in leisure walking were less likely to develop AD and other
      dementias. This finding suggests the importance of leisure walking as a dementia 
      prevention program for older adults.

LID - 10.3390/cells11132023 [doi]
AB  - Defects in brain energy metabolism and proteopathic stress are implicated in
      age-related degenerative neuronopathies, exemplified by Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
      and Parkinson's disease (PD). As the currently available drug regimens largely
      aim to mitigate cognitive decline and/or motor symptoms, there is a dire need for
      mechanism-based therapies that can be used to improve neuronal function and
      potentially slow down the underlying disease processes. In this context, a new
      class of pharmacological agents that achieve improved glycaemic control via the
      glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor has attracted significant attention as
      putative neuroprotective agents. The experimental evidence supporting their
      potential therapeutic value, mainly derived from cellular and animal models of AD
      and PD, has been discussed in several research reports and review opinions
      recently. In this review article, we discuss the pathological relevance of
      derangements in the neurovascular unit and the significance of neuron-glia
      metabolic coupling in AD and PD. With this context, we also discuss some
      unresolved questions with regard to the potential benefits of GLP-1 agonists on
      the neurovascular unit (NVU), and provide examples of novel experimental
      paradigms that could be useful in improving our understanding regarding the
      neuroprotective mode of action associated with these agents.

TI  - Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor mirodenafil ameliorates Alzheimer-like pathology
      and symptoms by multimodal actions.
PG  - 92
LID - 10.1186/s13195-022-01034-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology is associated with complex
      interactions among multiple factors, involving an intertwined network of various 
      signaling pathways. The polypharmacological approach is an emerging therapeutic
      strategy that has been proposed to overcome the multifactorial nature of AD by
      targeting multiple pathophysiological factors including amyloid-beta (Abeta) and 
      phosphorylated tau. We evaluated a blood-brain barrier penetrating
      phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor, mirodenafil
      (5-ethyl-2-7-n-propyl-3,5-dihydrro-4H-pyrrolo[3,2-d]pyrimidin-4-one), for its
      therapeutic effects on AD with polypharmacological properties. METHODS: To
      evaluate the potential of mirodenafil as a disease-modifying AD agent,
      mirodenafil was administered to test its effects on the cognitive behaviors of
      the APP-C105 AD mouse model using the Morris water maze and passive avoidance
      tests. To investigate the mechanisms of action that underlie the beneficial
      disease-modifying effects of mirodenafil, human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and
      mouse hippocampal HT-22 cells were used to show mirodenafil-induced alterations
      associated with the cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)/cGMP-dependent protein 
      kinase (PKG)/cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) pathway, apoptotic
      cell death, tau phosphorylation, amyloidogenesis, the autophagy-lysosome pathway,
      glucocorticoid receptor (GR) transcriptional activity, and the Wnt/beta-catenin
      signaling. RESULTS: Here, mirodenafil is demonstrated to improve cognitive
      behavior in the APP-C105 mouse model. Mirodenafil not only reduced the Abeta and 
      phosphorylated tau burdens in vivo, but also ameliorated AD pathology induced by 
      Abeta through the modulation of the cGMP/PKG/CREB signaling pathway, glycogen
      synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta) activity, GR transcriptional activity, and the 
      Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in neuronal cells. Interestingly, homodimerization and
      nuclear localization of GR were inhibited by mirodenafil, but not by other PDE5
      inhibitors. In addition, only mirodenafil reduced the expression levels of the
      Wnt antagonist Dickkopf-1 (Dkk-1), thus activating the Wnt/beta-catenin
      signaling. CONCLUSIONS: These findings strongly suggest that the PDE5 inhibitor
      mirodenafil shows promise as a potential polypharmacological drug candidate for
      AD treatment, acting on multiple key signaling pathways involved in amyloid
      deposition, phosphorylated tau burden, the cGMP/PKG/CREB pathway, GSK-3beta
      kinase activity, GR signaling, and the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Mirodenafil
      administration to the APP-C105 AD mouse model also improved cognitive behavior,
      demonstrating the potential of mirodenafil as a polypharmacological AD
      therapeutic agent.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Aduhelm is the first approved disease-modifying therapies (DMT) for
      Alzheimer disease (AD). Nevertheless, under current payment models, AD
      DMTs-especially because they treat broader populations-will pose challenges to
      patient access since costs may accrue sooner than benefits do. New payment
      approaches may be needed to address this difference in timing. METHODS: We use
      the Future Elderly Model that draws on nationally representative data sets such
      as the Health and Retirement Study to estimate the potential benefits because of 
      hypothetical AD DMTs in 4 stylized treatment scenarios for patients with mild
      cognitive impairment or mild AD, and develop a payment model to estimate the
      accrual of net costs and benefits to private and public payers. RESULTS: The
      modeled AD DMTs result in clinical benefit of 0.30 to 0.55 quality-adjusted
      life-years gained per patient in the baseline treatment scenario and 0.13 to 0.24
      quality-adjusted life-years gained per patient in the least optimistic scenario. 
      Private payers may observe a net loss in patients at the age of 61 to 65 years
      under the status quo (payment upon treatment). Constant and deferred installment 
      payment models resolve this issue. CONCLUSIONS: Innovative payment solutions,
      such as installment payments, may be required to address misaligned incentives
      that AD DMTs may create among patients younger than the age of 65 years and may

AB  - OBJETIVES: To estimate the frequency distribution, both allelic and genotypic, of
      the APOE gene in the Afro-descendant population of Buenaventura, Colombia.
      METHODS: Three hundred and forty-eight Afro-descendant individuals were analysed 
      and the APOE locus was genotyped by PCR-RFLP. The allelic and genotypic
      frequencies were established by direct counting and the Hardy-Weinberg
      equilibrium was evaluated through chi(2) test. The frequencies obtained in this
      study were compared with frequencies reported for other Colombian populations
      through the Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: The following allelic frequencies were 
      observed: E3, 70.8%; E4, 21.4%, and E2, 7.8%. The genotypic frequencies were:
      E3/E3, 51.1%; E3/E4, 27.3%; E2/E3, 12.1%; E4/E4, 6%; E2/E4, 3.5%, and E2/E2, 0%. 
      The entire examined population was found in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P=.074), 
      and significant differences were found in the allele E4 when comparing this
      population with the Amerindian and mestizo populations of Bogota, Quindio,
      Centro-Oriente, Valle del Cauca, Barranquilla and Medellin (P</= 0.0345).
      CONCLUSIONS: The allelic frequencies observed in this study were significantly
      different from the frequencies reported in other Colombian populations. The high 
      representativeness of the E4 and E2 alleles validates the hypothesis that there
      are micro-evolutionary processes that have been acting on their frequencies and
      could be associated with susceptibility to neuropsychiatric diseases such as
      Alzheimer's disease, metabolic alterations of fats and/or coronary artery
      disease.

AB  - Microglia are critical in brain development and Alzheimer's disease (AD)
      etiology. Down syndrome (DS) is the most common genetic developmental disorder
      and risk factor for AD. Surprisingly, little information is available on the
      impact of trisomy of human chromosome 21 (Hsa21) on microglial functions during
      DS brain development and in AD in DS. Using induced pluripotent stem cell
      (iPSC)-based organoid and chimeric mouse models, we report that DS microglia
      exhibit an enhanced synaptic pruning function, which alters neuronal synaptic
      functions. In response to human brain tissue-derived pathological tau, DS
      microglia undergo cellular senescence and exhibit elevated type-I-interferon
      signaling. Mechanistically, knockdown of Hsa21-encoded type I interferon
      receptors, IFNARs, rescues the DS microglial phenotypes both during brain
      development and in response to pathological tau. Our findings provide in vivo
      evidence that human microglia respond to pathological tau by exhibiting
      dystrophic phenotypes. Targeting IFNARs may improve DS microglial functions and
      prevent senescence.

AB  - Canine cognitive dysfunction (CCD) is a highly prevalent neurodegenerative
      disease considered the canine analog of early Alzheimer's disease (AD).
      Unfortunately, CCD cannot be cured. However, early therapeutic interventions can 
      slow the progression of cognitive decline and improve quality of life of the
      patients; therefore, early diagnosis is ideal. In humans, electroencephalogram
      (EEG) findings specific to AD have been described, and some of them have
      successfully detect early stages of the disease. In this study we characterized
      the EEG correlates of CCD, and we compared them with the EEGs of healthy aging
      dogs and dogs at risk of developing CCD. EEG recordings were performed in 25
      senior dogs during wakefulness. Dogs were categorized in normal, at risk of CCD
      or with CCD according to their score in the Rofina questionnaire. We demonstrated
      that, quantitative EEG can detect differences between normal dogs and dogs with
      CCD. Dogs with CCD experience a reduction in beta and gamma interhemispheric
      coherence, and higher Joint Lempel Ziv complexity. Dogs at risk of developing
      CCD, had higher alpha power and interhemispheric coherence, making these features
      potential markers of early stages of the disease. These results demonstrate that 
      quantitative EEG analysis could aid the diagnosis of CCD, and reinforce the CCD
      as a translational model of early AD.

      Rescue Abeta-Induced Mitochondrial Dysfunction.
PG  - 2176-2190

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common dementia affecting one in nine people
      over 65. Only a handful of small-molecule drugs and the anti-beta amyloid (Abeta)
      antibody aducanumab are approved to treat AD. However, they only serve to reduce 
      symptoms of advanced disease. Novel treatments administered early in disease
      progression before the accumulation of Abeta and tau reaches the threshold where 
      neuroinflammation is triggered and irreversible neuronal damage occurs are more
      likely to provide effective therapy. There is a growing body of evidence implying
      that mitochondrial dysfunction occurs at an early stage of AD pathology. The
      mitochondrial enzyme amyloid-binding alcohol dehydrogenase (ABAD) binds to Abeta 
      potentiating toxicity. Moreover, ABAD has been shown to be overexpressed in the
      same areas of the brain most affected by AD. Inhibiting the Abeta-ABAD
      protein-protein interaction without adversely affecting normal enzyme turnover is
      hypothesized to be a potential treatment strategy for AD. Herein, we conduct
      structure-activity relationship studies across a series of functionalized
      allopurinol derivatives to determine their ability to inhibit Abeta-mediated
      reduction of estradiol production from ABAD. The lead compound resulting from
      these studies possesses potent activity with no toxicity up to 100 muM, and
      demonstrates an ability to rescue defective mitochondrial metabolism in human
      SH-SY5Y cells and rescue both defective mitochondrial metabolism and morphology
      ex vivo in primary 5XFAD AD mouse model neurons.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia in the
      elderly population. It is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid beta and
      intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. Increasing evidence shows
      that the disturbance of insulin signalling in the brain may contribute to the
      pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. In type 1 diabetes, these disruptions are
      caused by hypoinsulinemia, but in type 2 diabetes, they are caused by insulin
      resistance and decreased insulin secretion. Multiple studies have shown that
      diabetes is connected with an increased risk of acquiring Alzheimer's disease.
      The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of anti-diabetic agents on
      Alzheimer's disease progression and the levels of Alzheimer's biomarkers in a
      hyperglycaemic rat model, which was induced by intraperitoneal injection of
      streptozocin to produce insulin-deficient diabetes. METHOD: Thirty-six male
      Wistar albino rats were allocated into six groups of six rats each. Group I was
      the negative control group. Intraperitoneal injections of streptozocin (42mg/kg) 
      were used once for the five experimental groups. Group II served as the positive 
      control group. The rats in Groups III, IV, V, and VI received metformin
      (300mg/kg), donepezil (10mg/kg), insulin glargine (3 unit/animal), and
      glibenclamide (10mg/kg), respectively, for 21 days. RESULTS: Inducing
      hyperglycaemia in rats significantly increased the levels of serum glucose,
      haemoglobin A1c, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein,
      interleukin 6, tumour necrosis factor alpha, amyloid beta 42, total plasma tau,
      and neurofilament light. A significant increase was also found in brain amyloid
      beta 42, nitric oxide, acetylcholinesterase, malondialdehyde, beta secretase, and
      phosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau. The greatest statistically
      significant reductions in serum glucose, haemoglobin A1c, triglycerides, amyloid 
      beta 42, total plasma tau, brain amyloid beta 42, acetylcholinesterase, and
      malondialdehyde were observed in rats treated with metformin. In contrast, rats
      treated with donepezil demonstrated the greatest statistically significant
      reduction in serum tumour necrosis factor alpha, brain nitric oxide, and beta
      secretase. The levels of neurofilament light and phosphorylated
      microtubule-associated protein tau in the brains of rats treated with insulin
      glargine were significantly lower than the other treatment groups. The total
      cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein levels in rats treated with glibenclamide
      exhibited the most statistically significant reductions of all the treatment
      groups. CONCLUSIONS: Metformin and donepezil, when administered at appropriate
      doses, were shown to successfully lower most plasma and brain biomarkers,
      including glucose, triglycerides, tumour necrosis factor alpha, amyloid beta 42, 
      nitric oxide, acetylcholinesterase, malondialdehyde, and beta secretase in rats
      suffering from Diabetes Mellitus. As a result of this research, we suggest that
      metformin, either alone or in conjunction with donepezil, might be an excellent
      drug of choice for neuro-regeneration and risk reduction in Alzheimer's like
      disease.

TI  - Dementia risk and dynamic response to exercise: A non-randomized clinical trial.
PG  - e0265860
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0265860 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Physical exercise may support brain health and cognition over the
      course of typical aging. The goal of this nonrandomized clinical trial was to
      examine the effect of an acute bout of aerobic exercise on brain blood flow and
      blood neurotrophic factors associated with exercise response and brain function
      in older adults with and without possession of the Apolipoprotein epsilon 4
      (APOE4) allele, a genetic risk factor for developing Alzheimer's. We hypothesized
      that older adult APOE4 carriers would have lower cerebral blood flow regulation
      and would demonstrate blunted neurotrophic response to exercise compared to
      noncarriers. METHODS: Sixty-two older adults (73+/-5 years old, 41 female [67%]) 
      consented to this prospectively enrolling clinical trial, utilizing a single arm,
      single visit, experimental design, with post-hoc assessment of difference in
      outcomes based on APOE4 carriership. All participants completed a single
      15-minute bout of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise. The primary outcome
      measure was change in cortical gray matter cerebral blood flow in cortical gray
      matter measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) arterial spin labeling (ASL),
      defined as the total perfusion (area under the curve, AUC) following exercise.
      Secondary outcomes were changes in blood neurotrophin concentrations of
      insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), 
      and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). RESULTS: Genotyping failed in one
      individual (n = 23 APOE4 carriers and n = 38 APOE4 non-carriers) and two
      participants could not complete primary outcome testing. Cerebral blood flow AUC 
      increased immediately following exercise, regardless of APOE4 carrier status. In 
      an exploratory regional analyses, we found that cerebral blood flow increased in 
      hippocampal brain regions, while showing no change in cerebellum across both
      groups. Among high inter-individual variability, there were no significant
      changes in any of the 3 neurotrophic factors for either group immediately
      following exercise. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that both APOE4 carriers and
      non-carriers show similar effects of exercise-induced increases in cerebral blood
      flow and neurotrophic response to acute aerobic exercise. Our results provide
      further evidence that acute exercise-induced increases in cerebral blood flow may
      be regional specific, and that exercise-induced neurotrophin release may show a
      differential effect in the aging cardiovascular system. Results from this study
      provide an initial characterization of the acute brain blood flow and
      neurotrophin responses to a bout of exercise in older adults with and without
      this known risk allele for cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer's disease. TRIAL

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of mental dementia in the aged 
      population. AD is characterized by the progressive decline of memory and multiple
      cognitive functions, and changes in behavior and personality. Recent research has
      revealed age-dependent increased levels of VDAC1 in postmortem AD brains and
      cerebral cortices of APP, APPxPS1, and 3xAD.Tg mice. Further, we found abnormal
      interaction between VDAC1 and P-Tau in the AD brains, leading to mitochondrial
      structural and functional defects. Our current study aimed to understand the
      impact of a partial reduction of voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1)
      protein on mitophagy/autophagy, mitochondrial and synaptic activities, and
      behavior changes in transgenic TAU mice in Alzheimer's disease. To determine if a
      partial reduction of VDAC1 reduces mitochondrial and synaptic toxicities in
      transgenic Tau (P301L) mice, we crossed heterozygote VDAC1 knockout (VDAC1(+/-) )
      mice with TAU mice and generated double mutant (VDAC1(+/-) /TAU) mice. We
      assessed phenotypic behavior, protein levels of mitophagy, autophagy, synaptic,
      other key proteins, mitochondrial morphology, and dendritic spines in TAU mice
      relative to double mutant mice. Partial reduction of VDAC1 rescued the
      TAU-induced behavioral impairments such as motor coordination and exploratory
      behavioral changes, and learning and spatial memory impairments in VDAC1(+/-)
      /TAU mice. Protein levels of mitophagy, autophagy, and synaptic proteins were
      significantly increased in double mutant mice compared with TAU mice. In
      addition, dendritic spines were significantly increased; the mitochondrial number
      was significantly reduced, and mitochondrial length was increased in double
      mutant mice. Based on these observations, we conclude that reduced VDAC1 is
      beneficial in symptomatic-transgenic TAU mice.

AB  - Plasma-based biomarkers present a promising approach in the research and clinical
      practice of Alzheimer's disease as they are inexpensive, accessible and minimally
      invasive. In particular, prognostic biomarkers of cognitive decline may aid in
      planning and management of clinical care. Although recent studies have
      demonstrated the prognostic utility of plasma biomarkers of Alzheimer pathology
      or neurodegeneration, such as pTau-181 and NF-L, whether other plasma biomarkers 
      can further improve prediction of cognitive decline is undetermined. We conducted
      an observational cohort study to determine the prognostic utility of plasma
      biomarkers in predicting progression to dementia for individuals presenting with 
      mild cognitive impairment due to probable Alzheimer's disease. We used the Olink 
      Proximity Extension Assay technology to measure the level of 460 circulating
      proteins in banked plasma samples of all participants. We used a discovery data
      set comprised 60 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (30 progressors and
      30 stable) and a validation data set consisting of 21 stable and 21 progressors. 
      We developed a machine learning model to distinguish progressors from stable and 
      used 44 proteins with significantly different plasma levels in progressors versus
      stable along with age, sex, education and baseline cognition as candidate
      features. A model with age, education, APOE genotype, baseline cognition, plasma 
      pTau-181 and 12 plasma Olink protein biomarker levels was able to distinguish
      progressors from stable with 86.7% accuracy (mean area under the curve = 0.88).
      In the validation data set, the model accuracy was 78.6%. The Olink proteins
      selected by the model included those associated with vascular injury and
      neuroinflammation (e.g. IL-8, IL-17A, TIMP-4, MMP7). In addition, to compare
      these prognostic biomarkers to those that are altered in Alzheimer's disease or
      other types of dementia relative to controls, we analyzed samples from 20
      individuals with Alzheimer, 30 with non-Alzheimer dementias and 34 with normal
      cognition. The proteins NF-L and PTP-1B were significantly higher in both
      Alzheimer and non-Alzheimer dementias compared with cognitively normal
      individuals. Interestingly, the prognostic markers of decline at the mild
      cognitive impairment stage did not overlap with those that differed between
      dementia and control cases. In summary, our findings suggest that plasma
      biomarkers of inflammation and vascular injury are associated with cognitive
      decline. Developing a plasma biomarker profile could aid in prognostic
      deliberations and identify individuals at higher risk of dementia in clinical
      practice.

AB  - Softwares are involved in all aspects of healthcare, such as booking appointments
      to software systems that are used for treatment and care of patients. Many
      vendors and consultants develop high quality software healthcare systems such as 
      hospital management systems, medical electronic systems, and middle-ware
      softwares in medical devices. Internet of Things (IoT) medical devices are
      gaining attention and facilitate the people with new technology. The health
      condition of the patients are monitored by the IoT devices using sensors,
      specifically brain diseases such as Alzheimer, Parkinson's, and Traumatic brain
      injury. Embedded software is present in IoT medical devices and the complexity of
      software increases day-by-day with the increase in the number and complexity of
      bugs in the devices. Bugs present in IoT medical devices can have severe
      consequences such as inaccurate records, circulatory suffering, and death in some
      cases along with delay in handling patients. There is a need to predict the
      impact of bugs (severe or nonsevere), especially in case of IoT medical devices
      due to their critical nature. This research proposes a hybrid bug severity
      prediction model using convolution neural network (CNN) and Harris Hawk
      optimization (HHO) based on an optimized hyperparameter of CNN with HHO. The
      dataset is created, that consists of the bugs present in healthcare systems and
      IoT medical devices, which is used for evaluation of the proposed model. A
      preprocessing technique on textual dataset is applied along with a feature
      extraction technique for CNN embedding layer. In HHO, we define the
      hyperparameter values of "Batch Size, Learning Rate, Activation Function,
      Optimizer Parameters, and Kernel Initializers," before training the model. Hybrid
      model CNN-HHO is applied, and a 10-fold cross validation is performed for
      evaluation. Results indicate an accuracy of 96.21% with the proposed model.

AB  - Background: Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the highest frequent malignant tumors
      with very complicated pathogenesis. Genes of neurodegenerative diseases can
      influence tumor progression. But its role in the progression of PCa remains
      unclear. The purpose of the present academic work was to identify significant
      genes with poor outcome and their underlying mechanism. Methods: The GSE70768,
      GSE88808, and GSE134051 datasets were downloaded to screen the differentially
      expressed genes (DEGs). The DEG screening criteria were as follows: P < 0.05 and 
      differential fold change |logFC| >/= 1. The common DEGs (co-DEGs) of the three
      datasets were obtained by the Robust Rank Aggregation (RRA) method. Gene Ontology
      (GO) function annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG)
      pathway analysis were performed using R software. Protein-protein interaction
      (PPI) network analysis was performed for co-DEGs using STRING to screen critical 
      genes. Differential expression and prognosis of key genes were analyzed by the
      online tool Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis 2 (GEPIA2). The
      intersection gene between key genes and neurodegenerative genes was identified by
      constructing a Venn diagram. Results: A total of 263 co-DEGs were identified from
      the three datasets. GO analysis showed that co-DEGs were mainly involved in
      muscle contraction and blood circulation regulation. The top ten key genes were
      ACTG2, APOE, F5, CALD1, MYH11, MYL9, MYLK, TPM1, TPM2, and CALM1. GEPIA2 analysis
      showed that APOE, MYH11, and MYLK differ dramatically between tumor and normal
      tissues. These key genes are related to disease-free survival (DFS) in PCa. APOE 
      was the intersection gene between key genes and Alzheimer-related genes.
      Conclusion: The neurodegenerative gene APOE may be a potential prognostic and
      diagnostic biomarker for PCa.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pragmatic biomarkers of preclinical dementia would allow for easy and
      large-scale screening of risk in populations. Physical function measures like
      grip strength and gait speed are potential predictive biomarkers but their
      relationship with plasma markers of Alzheimer's Disease and neurodegeneration
      have not been elucidated. OBJECTIVES: To examine association between physical
      function measures and plasma markers of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and
      neurodegeneration. DESIGN: Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. SETTING:
      Community-based cohort in the city of Framingham, Massachusetts. PARTICIPANTS:
      2336 participants of the Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort with an average 
      age of 61. MEASUREMENTS: Plasma Abeta40 and Abeta42 were measured in 1998-2001
      (Exam-7) and plasma total tau measured 5 years later (Exam-8). Grip strength,
      fast walk speed and chair stand speed were measured at both exams. Quantification
      of Abeta isoforms in plasma was performed using INNO-BIA assays and plasma
      total-tau was measured using Quanterix Simoa HD-1 assay. Confounder-adjusted
      linear regression models examined associations between physical function and
      plasma markers, Results: Grip strength at Exam-7 was associated with plasma
      Abeta40 (beta -0.006, p-value 0.032) at Exam-7 and plasma total-tau (beta -0.010,
      p-value 0.001) at Exam-8. Grip strength and fast walk speed at Exam-8 were
      associated with plasma total-tau at Exam-8 (GS: beta -0.009, p 0.0005; FWS: beta 
      -0.226, p-value <0.0001). Chair stand speed was not associated with plasma
      markers; Abeta42 was not associated with function. CONCLUSION: Grip strength and 
      fast walk speed are associated with plasma markers of neurodegeneration in
      dementia-free middle aged and older individuals. Both these measures could be
      used as potential screening tools for identifying individuals at a higher risk
      for AD and related dementias alongside other validated markers.

TI  - Classifying the lifestyle status for Alzheimer's disease from clinical notes
      using deep learning with weak supervision.
PG  - 88
LID - 10.1186/s12911-022-01819-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since no effective therapies exist for Alzheimer's disease (AD),
      prevention has become more critical through lifestyle status changes and
      interventions. Analyzing electronic health records (EHRs) of patients with AD can
      help us better understand lifestyle's effect on AD. However, lifestyle
      information is typically stored in clinical narratives. Thus, the objective of
      the study was to compare different natural language processing (NLP) models on
      classifying the lifestyle statuses (e.g., physical activity and excessive diet)
      from clinical texts in English. METHODS: Based on the collected concept unique
      identifiers (CUIs) associated with the lifestyle status, we extracted all related
      EHRs for patients with AD from the Clinical Data Repository (CDR) of the
      University of Minnesota (UMN). We automatically generated labels for the training
      data by using a rule-based NLP algorithm. We conducted weak supervision for
      pre-trained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) models
      and three traditional machine learning models as baseline models on the weakly
      labeled training corpus. These models include the BERT base model, PubMedBERT
      (abstracts + full text), PubMedBERT (only abstracts), Unified Medical Language
      System (UMLS) BERT, Bio BERT, Bio-clinical BERT, logistic regression, support
      vector machine, and random forest. The rule-based model used for weak supervision
      was tested on the GSC for comparison. We performed two case studies: physical
      activity and excessive diet, in order to validate the effectiveness of BERT
      models in classifying lifestyle status for all models were evaluated and compared
      on the developed Gold Standard Corpus (GSC) on the two case studies. RESULTS: The
      UMLS BERT model achieved the best performance for classifying status of physical 
      activity, with its precision, recall, and F-1 scores of 0.93, 0.93, and 0.92,
      respectively. Regarding classifying excessive diet, the Bio-clinical BERT model
      showed the best performance with precision, recall, and F-1 scores of 0.93, 0.93,
      and 0.93, respectively. CONCLUSION: The proposed approach leveraging weak
      supervision could significantly increase the sample size, which is required for
      training the deep learning models. By comparing with the traditional machine
      learning models, the study also demonstrates the high performance of BERT models 
      for classifying lifestyle status for Alzheimer's disease in clinical notes.

AB  - Frontotemporal dementia is characterized by progressive atrophy of frontal and/or
      temporal cortices at an early age of onset. The disorder shows considerable
      clinical, pathological, and genetic heterogeneity. Here we investigated the
      proteomic signatures of frontal and temporal cortex from brains with
      frontotemporal dementia due to GRN and MAPT mutations to identify the key cell
      types and molecular pathways in their pathophysiology. We compared patients with 
      mutations in the GRN gene (n = 9) or with mutations in the MAPT gene (n = 13)
      with non-demented controls (n = 11). Using quantitative proteomic analysis on
      laser-dissected tissues we identified brain region-specific protein signatures
      for both genetic subtypes. Using published single cell RNA expression data
      resources we deduced the involvement of major brain cell types in driving these
      different protein signatures. Subsequent gene ontology analysis identified
      distinct genetic subtype- and cell type-specific biological processes. For the
      GRN subtype, we observed a distinct role for immune processes related to
      endothelial cells and for mitochondrial dysregulation in neurons. For the MAPT
      subtype, we observed distinct involvement of dysregulated RNA processing,
      oligodendrocyte dysfunction, and axonal impairments. Comparison with an in-house 
      protein signature of Alzheimer's disease brains indicated that the observed
      alterations in RNA processing and oligodendrocyte function are distinct for the
      frontotemporal dementia MAPT subtype. Taken together, our results indicate the
      involvement of different brain cell types and biological mechanisms in genetic
      subtypes of frontotemporal dementia. Furthermore, we demonstrate that comparison 
      of proteomic profiles of different disease entities can separate general
      neurodegenerative processes from disease-specific pathways, which may aid the
      development of disease subtype-specific treatment strategies.

AB  - Blood-brain barrier is a pivotal factor to be considered in the process of
      central nervous system (CNS) drug development, and it is of great significance to
      rapidly explore the blood-brain barrier permeability (BBBp) of compounds in
      silico in early drug discovery process. Here, we focus on whether and how
      uncertainty estimation methods improve in silico BBBp models. We briefly surveyed
      the current state of in silico BBBp prediction and uncertainty estimation methods
      of deep learning models, and curated an independent dataset to determine the
      reliability of the state-of-the-art algorithms. The results exhibit that, despite
      the comparable performance on BBBp prediction between graph neural networks-based
      deep learning models and conventional physicochemical-based machine learning
      models, the GROVER-BBBp model shows greatly improvement when using uncertainty
      estimations. In particular, the strategy combined Entropy and MC-dropout can
      increase the accuracy of distinguishing BBB + from BBB - to above 99% by
      extracting predictions with high confidence level (uncertainty score < 0.1). Case
      studies on preclinical/clinical drugs for Alzheimer' s disease and marketed
      antitumor drugs that verified by literature proved the application value of
      uncertainty estimation enhanced BBBp prediction model, that may facilitate the
      drug discovery in the field of CNS diseases and metastatic brain tumors.

TI  - Diagnosis of Parkinson syndrome and Lewy-body disease using (123)I-ioflupane
      images and a model with image features based on machine learning.
PG  - 765-776
LID - 10.1007/s12149-022-01759-z [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: (123)I-ioflupane has been clinically applied to dopamine transporter 
      imaging and visual interpretation assisted by region-of-interest (ROI)-based
      parameters. We aimed to build a multivariable model incorporating machine
      learning (ML) that could accurately differentiate abnormal profiles on
      (123)I-ioflupane images and diagnose Parkinson syndrome or disease and dementia
      with Lewy bodies (PS/PD/DLB). METHODS: We assessed (123)I-ioflupane images from
      239 patients with suspected neurodegenerative diseases or dementia and classified
      them as having PS/PD/DLB or non-PS/PD/DLB. The image features of high or low
      uptake (F1), symmetry or asymmetry (F2), and comma- or dot-like patterns of
      caudate and putamen uptake (F3) were analyzed on 137 images from one hospital for
      training. Direct judgement of normal or abnormal profiles (F4) was also examined.
      Machine learning methods included logistic regression (LR), k-nearest neighbors
      (kNNs), and gradient boosted trees (GBTs) that were assessed using fourfold
      cross-validation. We generated the following multivariable models for the test
      database (n = 102 from another hospital): Model 1, ROI-based measurements of
      specific binding ratios and asymmetry indices; Model 2, ML-based judgement of
      abnormalities (F4); and Model 3, features F1, F2 and F3, plus patient age.
      Diagnostic accuracy was compared using areas under receiver-operating
      characteristics curves (AUC). RESULTS: The AUC was high with all ML methods
      (0.92-0.96) for high or low uptake. The AUC was the highest for symmetry or
      asymmetry with the kNN method (AUC 0.75) and the comma-dot feature with the GBT
      method (AUC 0.94). Based on the test data set, the diagnostic accuracy for a
      diagnosis of PS/PD/DLB was 0.86 +/- 0.04 (SE), 0.87 +/- 0.04, and 0.93 +/- 0.02
      for Models 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The AUC was optimal for Model 3, and
      significantly differed between Models 3 and 1 (p = 0.027), and 3 and 2 (p =
      0.029). CONCLUSIONS: Image features such as high or low uptake, symmetry or
      asymmetry, and comma- or dot-like profiles can be determined using ML. The
      diagnostic accuracy of differentiating PS/PD/DLB was the highest for the
      multivariate model with three features and age compared with the conventional
      ROI-based method.

TI  - Circulating N-Acetylaspartate does not track brain NAA concentrations, cognitive 
      function or features of small vessel disease in humans.

AB  - N-acetylaspartate (NAA) is the second most abundant metabolite in the human
      brain; although it is assumed to be a proxy for a neuronal marker, its function
      is not fully elucidated. NAA is also detectable in plasma, but its relation to
      cerebral NAA levels, cognitive performance, or features of cerebral disease has
      not been investigated. To study whether circulating NAA tracks cerebral NAA
      levels, and whether circulating NAA correlates with cognitive function and
      features of cerebral small vessel disease (SVD). Two datasets were analyzed. In
      dataset 1, structural MRI was acquired in 533 subjects to assess four features of
      cerebral SVD. Cognitive function was evaluated with standardized test scores (N =
      824). In dataset 2, brain (1)H-MRS from the occipital region was acquired (N =
      49). In all subjects, fasting circulating NAA was measured with mass
      spectrometry. Dataset 1: in univariate and adjusted for confounders models, we
      found no correlation between circulating NAA and the examined features of
      cerebral SVD. In univariate analysis, circulating NAA levels were associated
      inversely with the speed in information processing and the executive function
      score, however these associations were lost after accounting for confounders. In 
      line with the negative findings of dataset 1, in dataset 2 there was no
      correlation between circulating and central NAA or total NAA levels. This study
      indicates that circulating NAA levels do not reflect central (occipital) NAA
      levels, cognitive function, or cerebral small vessel disease in man.

TI  - Scalar on time-by-distribution regression and its application for modelling
      associations between daily-living physical activity and cognitive functions in
      Alzheimer's Disease.

AB  - Wearable data is a rich source of information that can provide a deeper
      understanding of links between human behaviors and human health. Existing
      modelling approaches use wearable data summarized at subject level via scalar
      summaries in regression, temporal (time-of-day) curves in functional data
      analysis (FDA), and distributions in distributional data analysis (DDA). We
      propose to capture temporally local distributional information in wearable data
      using subject-specific time-by-distribution (TD) data objects. Specifically, we
      develop scalar on time-by-distribution regression (SOTDR) to model associations
      between scalar response of interest such as health outcomes or disease status and
      TD predictors. Additionally, we show that TD data objects can be parsimoniously
      represented via a collection of time-varying L-moments that capture
      distributional changes over the time-of-day. The proposed method is applied to
      the accelerometry study of mild Alzheimer's disease (AD). We found that mild AD
      is significantly associated with reduced upper quantile levels of physical
      activity, particularly during morning hours. In-sample cross validation
      demonstrated that TD predictors attain much stronger associations with clinical
      cognitive scales of attention, verbal memory, and executive function when
      compared to predictors summarized via scalar total activity counts, temporal
      functional curves, and quantile functions. Taken together, the present results
      suggest that SOTDR analysis provides novel insights into cognitive function and
      AD.

AB  - Amyloid fibrils and fibril-like structures are currently estimated to represent
      many different products of several genes in humans and play a key role in many
      types of proteinopathies, commonly associated with ageing process. They share the
      mutual feature of aggregation-prone proteins and the building up of
      molecular-supramolecular structure, such as inter-neuronal plaques in the brain
      of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients, characterized by an extraordinary strength.
      Noteworthy, this type of structure has been reported in different organisms, in
      particular in invertebrates. The aim of the current review is to focus on alpha
      and beta amyloids i.e., SAAs, SAP and APP, elucidating the structure and function
      of amyloid proteins in invertebrates (such as nematods, annelids, molluscs,
      insects, ascidians) and highlighting their striking pattern of functional
      conservation when compared to human amyloid-like fibrils, thus focusing on
      possible new studies and applications for innovative therapies, particularly for 
      AD, the most common and worldwide type of dementia.

AB  - Thirty-three natural products were isolated from the aerial parts of Antidesma
      bunius, Euphorbiaceae, a plant used in Vietnamese traditional medicine against
      rheumatoid arthritis. All compounds were reported the first time for this
      species, and nine constituents resembled undescribed natural products, noticeably
      three coumarinolignans with 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolane moiety, two cyclopeptides,
      and two furofuran-type lignans connected with a phenylpropanoid moiety. The
      individual structures were elucidated by combining NMR and MS data, and their
      configuration was established by NOESY and ECD experiments and NMR calculations. 
      Compounds with sufficient amount were analyzed for their inhibition of advanced
      glycation endproducts (AGEs) formation, metabolites involved in many diseases
      like Alzheimer, joint diseases or diabetes. With IC50 values below 0.2 mM rutin
      and p-hydroxyphenethyl trans-ferulate showed to be moderately active, both still 
      being 10-times more active than the positive control aminoguanidine.

AB  - Targeting modifiable risk factors may help to prevent Alzheimer's disease (AD),
      but the pathways by which these risk factors influence AD risk remain
      incompletely understood. We identified genome-wide association studies for AD and
      its major modifiable risk factors. We calculated the genetic correlation among
      these traits and modelled this using genomic structural equation modelling. We
      identified complex networks of genetic overlap among AD risk factors, but AD
      itself was largely genetically distinct. The data were best explained by a
      bi-factor model, incorporating a Common Factor for AD risk, and 3 orthogonal
      sub-clusters of risk factors. Taken together, our findings suggest that there is 
      extensive shared genetic architecture between AD modifiable risk factors, but
      this is largely independent of AD genetic pathways. Extensive genetic pleiotropy 
      between risk factors may influence AD indirectly by decreasing cognitive reserve 
      or increasing risk of multimorbidity, leading to poorer brain health. Further
      work to understand the biology reflected by this communality may provide novel
      mechanistic insights that could help to prioritise targets for dementia
      prevention.

      study between younger and older adults.

AB  - The stigma and negative attitudes surrounding Alzheimer's disease (AD) are
      reinforced by the prevalence of their negative representations. This study aimed 
      to determine how AD framing influences attitudes towards AD and whether this
      influence differs between younger and older people. Additionally, the elaboration
      likelihood model (ELM) was used to examine the mediating role that emotions
      induced by different frames may have in bringing about attitude change. Posters
      with framed messages on AD (dualism and unity) were designed and shown to 136
      participants (68 younger and 68 older adults). Both the younger and older
      participants were randomly divided into two sub-groups. Each sub-group was shown 
      posters of a campaign with different AD frames: one group viewed posters with
      messages of the dualism frame and the other group viewed posters with messages of
      the unity frame. To analyse the effect of the different frames, a mixed design of
      repeated measures (ANOVA) was used in which attitudes towards AD were measured on
      two occasions. Both the impact and the emotions produced by exposure to the
      messages were recorded after the presentation of the posters and a MANOVA test
      was performed on them. Attitudes, impact and emotions experienced by the younger 
      and older participants were compared. Older adults displayed positive attitudes
      towards AD but less than younger people. Unity-framed messages produced a
      positive change in attitudes regardless of the audience's age and led to higher
      levels of happiness, whereas dualism-framed messages had a greater impact and
      produced feelings of sadness, anger and fear but did not change attitudes. These 
      findings suggest that reframing of AD may be essential to achieve a positive
      attitudinal change in both younger and older populations and foster positive
      emotions. The use of unity-framed messages should be considered when developing
      and implementing policies targeted at communication and awareness of AD in order 
      to reduce the stigma associated with this form of dementia.

TI  - Design, Synthesis, and Pharmacological Evaluation of N-Propargylated
      Diphenylpyrimidines as Multitarget Directed Ligands for the Treatment of
      Alzheimer's Disease.
PG  - 2122-2139
LID - 10.1021/acschemneuro.2c00132 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD), a multifactorial complex neural disorder, is
      categorized with progressive memory loss and cognitive impairment as main
      clinical features. The multitarget directed ligand (MTDL) strategy is explored
      for the treatment of multifactorial diseases such as cancer and AD. Herein, we
      report the synthesis and screening of 24 N-propargyl-substituted
      diphenylpyrimidine derivatives as MTDLs against acetylcholine/butyrylcholine
      esterases and monoamine oxidase enzymes. In this series, VP1 showed the most
      potent MAO-B inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 0.04 +/- 0.002 muM. VP15
      with an IC50 value of 0.04 +/- 0.003 muM and a selectivity index of 626 (over
      BuChE) displayed the most potent AChE inhibitory activity in this series. In the 
      reactive oxygen species (ROS) inhibition studies, VP1 reduced intercellular ROS
      levels in SH-SY5Y cells by 36%. This series of compounds also exhibited potent
      neuroprotective potential against 6-hydroxydopamine-induced neuronal damage in
      SH-SY5Y cells with up to 90% recovery. In the in vivo studies in the rats, the
      hydrochloride salt of VP15 was orally administered and found to cross the
      blood-brain barrier and reach the target site. VP15.HCl significantly attenuated 
      the spatial memory impairment and improved the cognitive deficits in the mice.
      This series of compounds were found to be irreversible inhibitors and showed no
      cytotoxicity against neuronal cells. In in silico studies, the compounds attained
      thermodynamically stable orientation with complete occupancy at the active site
      of the receptors. Thus, N-propargyl-substituted diphenylpyrimidines displayed
      drug-like characteristics and have the potential to be developed as MTDLs for the
      effective treatment of AD.

TI  - Social engagement and its links to cognition differ across non-Hispanic Black and
      White older adults.
LID - 10.1037/neu0000844 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Racial inequalities in dementia have been linked to disparities in
      socioeconomic status, chronic diseases, and psychosocial stress. Less focus has
      been given to psychosocial protective factors. Previous studies suggest that
      social engagement promotes better cognitive aging, but few have examined whether 
      social engagement or its associations with cognition vary across non-Hispanic
      Whites (NHW) and Blacks (NHB). METHOD: Participants included 465 adults (53% NHB)
      from the Michigan Cognitive Aging Project (Mage = 63.59 +/- 3.15) who completed a
      comprehensive neuropsychological battery. Social engagement was operationalized
      as network size, frequency of social activity participation, and social support. 
      Cognition was operationalized using factor scores corresponding to five domains: 
      episodic memory, executive functioning, processing speed, language, and
      visuospatial functioning. Cross-sectional associations between social engagement 
      and cognitive outcomes were examined using race-stratified regressions
      controlling for age, sex/gender, education, wealth, marital status, depressive
      symptoms, and chronic diseases. RESULTS: There were no racial differences in
      social network size or social support. NHB participants reported less social
      activity participation than NHW participants. Social activity participation was
      positively associated with memory in NHW, but not NHB. CONCLUSIONS: These
      findings may suggest a threshold effect whereby NHB older adults are less likely 
      to participate in social activities at the level needed to yield cognitive
      benefits. Lower social activity participation among NHB may reflect structural
      barriers and/or cultural differences in patterns of social engagement. This study
      highlights the need to improve measurement of and access to culturally relevant
      social activities for NHB to combat racial inequalities in cognitive aging.

TI  - Top-down and bottom-up sources of eye-movement guidance during realistic scene
      search in Alzheimer's disease.
LID - 10.1037/neu0000797 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Visual search is a crucial task in daily life, but in Alzheimer's
      disease (AD) it has usually been investigated using simple arrays. Here, we used 
      scenes depicting real environments and studied the time course of attentional
      guidance. METHOD: We analyzed eye-movement differences between mild AD patients
      and age-matched healthy controls during search. We examined top-down guidance,
      manipulating the target template (precise picture vs. word cue) and the
      target-scene semantic consistency (consistent vs. inconsistent), and bottom-up
      guidance, manipulating the perceptual salience (high vs. low) of targets and
      distractors. RESULTS: During scene scanning, AD patients had longer search times,
      made more fixations before the first target fixation, and showed a greater
      probability of distractor selection, with longer distractor fixation. AD also led
      to longer target fixation. In patients and controls, picture cues and highly
      salient targets improved all search phases, whereas consistent targets only
      improved search initiation (first saccade). Moreover, top-down and bottom-up
      guidance interacted in initiation and scanning, and this did not differ between
      the two groups of participants. However, AD led to a smaller picture cue benefit 
      in shortening distractor fixation and greater bottom-up search facilitation
      during scanning, where a high-salience target reduced the performance gap between
      patients and controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows the importance of top-down
      and bottom-up guidance, and their integration, in improving search in AD
      patients. It suggests that precise target cues and, even more, highly salient
      targets may act as environmental supports that enhance attentional processing and
      search performance. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved).

TI  - Perceptions of Research Burden and Retention Among Participants in ADRC Cohorts.
LID - 10.1097/WAD.0000000000000514 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Alzheimer disease (AD) and related dementias clinical research is
      associated with significant participant burden. The Perceived Research Burden
      Assessment (PeRBA) measures participants' perceptions of logistical,
      psychological, and physical burdens. The purpose of this study was to assess
      PeRBA's psychometric properties, perceptual sources, and behavioral consequences 
      with participants in a multisite study of participant retention in longitudinal
      cohort studies of Alzheimer disease and related dementias. DESIGN: Multicenter
      mixed methods. SETTING: In-person or phone. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 443
      participants at 4 NIA-funded Alzheimer Disease Research Centers (ADRCs) were
      randomly selected and invited to participate if they were 45 years of age or
      more, enrolled in longitudinal studies, and had a Clinical Dementia Rating Scale 
      global score </=1. MEASUREMENTS: Participants completed a 20-minute survey
      including the 21-item PeRBA about their research participation. RESULTS: PeRBA
      demonstrated high-internal consistency and convergent validity. PeRBA scores
      correlated with expected perceptual factors. Higher PeRBA scores were associated 
      with lower attendance and higher dropout rates. CONCLUSIONS: PeRBA can be used by
      researchers to identify participants who may feel overburdened and tailor
      approaches and strategies to support participants in longitudinal AD studies,
      maximizing participation, and reducing dropout. Making efforts to increase
      participants' understanding of study procedures, and building and maintaining
      trust throughout the study, can contribute to reducing perceived burden and
      potentially increasing retention in longitudinal AD studies.

TI  - Development of potent cholinesterase inhibitors based on a marine pharmacophore.
PG  - 5589-5601
LID - 10.1039/d2ob01064j [doi]
AB  - The management of neurological disorders such as dementia associated with
      Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease includes the use of cholinesterase inhibitors.
      These compounds can slow down the progression of these diseases and can also be
      used in the treatment of glaucoma and myasthenia gravis. The majority of the
      cholinesterase inhibitors used in the clinic are derived from natural products
      and our current paper describes the use of a small marine pharmacophore to
      develop potent and selective cholinesterase inhibitors. Fourteen small inhibitors
      were designed based on recent discoveries about the inhibitory potential of a
      range of related marine secondary metabolites. The compounds were evaluated, in
      kinetic enzymatic assays, for their ability to inhibit three different
      cholinesterase enzymes and it was shown that compounds with a high inhibitory
      activity towards electric eel and human recombinant acetylcholinesterase (IC50
      between 20-70 muM) could be prepared. It was also shown that this compound class 
      was particularly active against horse serum butyrylcholinesterase, with IC50
      values between 0.8-16 muM, which is an order of magnitude more potent than the
      clinically used positive control neostigmine. The compounds were further tested
      for off-target toxicity against both human umbilical vein endothelial cells and
      bovine and human erythrocytes and were shown to display a low mammalian cellular 
      toxicity. Overall, the study illustrates how the brominated dipeptide marine
      pharmacophore can be used as a versatile natural scaffold for the design of
      potent, and selective cholinesterase inhibitors.

TI  - Bis-iodine-labeled Curcumin as a Potential CT Imaging Agent for beta-amyloid
      Plaques in the Brain.
LID - 10.2174/1871527321666220707091435 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common causes of
      dementia, affecting many old people. OBJECTIVES: By designing and synthesizing
      intracerebral imaging probes, we try to provide a new solution for early
      diagnosis of AD. METHODS: We designed and synthesized bis-iodine-labeled
      curcumin, and verified its performance through in vivo and in vitro experiments. 
      RESULTS: In this study, bis-iodine-labeled curcumin (7, BICUR) was synthesized.
      In the in vitro mass spectrum binding assay, Kd values of BICUR with Abeta1-40
      and Abeta1-42 aggregates were 46.29 nM and 64.29 nM, respectively. Abeta plaques 
      in AD brain adjacent sections were positively stained by BICUR, which was similar
      to some other curcumin derivatives. The LogP value of BICUR was 1.45. In the
      biodistribution experiment, BICUR showed the highest initial brain uptake (5.87% 
      compared with the blood concentration) two minutes after the tail vein injection 
      and rapid clearance from the mouse brain. In the acute toxicity experiment, BICUR
      showed low toxicity, and the LD50 was > 100 mg/kg. Moreover, BICUR showed a high 
      stability in vitro (86.68% unchanged BICUR after incubation for 120 min in mouse 
      brain homogenate). Besides, BICUR produced an enhanced CT imaging effect that
      could be sensitively detected in vitro, but it also showed an obvious
      differentiation from surrounding tissues after intracerebral injection.
      CONCLUSION: All results suggested that BICUR could probably act as a targeted CT 
      imaging agent for Abeta plaques in the brain.

TI  - Automated detection of mild cognitive impairment and dementia from voice
      recordings: A natural language processing approach.
LID - 10.1002/alz.12721 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Automated computational assessment of neuropsychological tests
      would enable widespread, cost-effective screening for dementia. METHODS: A novel 
      natural language processing approach is developed and validated to identify
      different stages of dementia based on automated transcription of digital voice
      recordings of subjects' neuropsychological tests conducted by the Framingham
      Heart Study (n = 1084). Transcribed sentences from the test were encoded into
      quantitative data and several models were trained and tested using these data and
      the participants' demographic characteristics. RESULTS: Average area under the
      curve (AUC) on the held-out test data reached 92.6%, 88.0%, and 74.4% for
      differentiating Normal cognition from Dementia, Normal or Mild Cognitive
      Impairment (MCI) from Dementia, and Normal from MCI, respectively. DISCUSSION:
      The proposed approach offers a fully automated identification of MCI and dementia
      based on a recorded neuropsychological test, providing an opportunity to develop 
      a remote screening tool that could be adapted easily to any language.

TI  - [(18)F]THK-5351 PET Patterns in Patients With Alzheimer's Disease and Negative
      Amyloid PET Findings.
PG  - 437-446
LID - 10.3988/jcn.2022.18.4.437 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) does not always mean amyloid
      positivity. [(18)F]THK-5351 has been shown to be able to detect reactive
      astrogliosis as well as tau accompanied by neurodegenerative changes. We
      evaluated the [(18)F]THK-5351 retention patterns in positron-emission tomography 
      (PET) and the clinical characteristics of patients clinically diagnosed with AD
      dementia who had negative amyloid PET findings. METHODS: We performed 3.0-T
      magnetic resonance imaging, [(18)F]THK-5351 PET, and amyloid PET in 164 patients 
      with AD dementia. Amyloid PET was visually scored as positive or negative.
      [(18)F]THK-5351 PET were visually classified as having an intratemporal or
      extratemporal spread pattern. RESULTS: The 164 patients included 23 (14.0%) who
      were amyloid-negative (age 74.9+/-8.3 years, mean+/-standard deviation; 9 males, 
      14 females). Amyloid-negative patients were older, had a higher prevalence of
      diabetes mellitus, and had better visuospatial and memory functions. The
      frequency of the apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele was higher and the hippocampal 
      volume was smaller in amyloid-positive patients. [(18)F]THK-5351 uptake patterns 
      of the amyloid-negative patients were classified into intratemporal spread (n=10)
      and extratemporal spread (n=13). Neuropsychological test results did not differ
      significantly between these two groups. The standardized uptake value ratio of
      [(18)F]THK-5351 was higher in the extratemporal spread group (2.01+/-0.26 vs.
      1.61+/-0.15, p=0.001). After 1 year, Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores 
      decreased significantly in the extratemporal spread group (-3.5+/-3.2, p=0.006)
      but not in the intratemporal spread group (-0.5+/-2.8, p=0.916). The diagnosis
      remained as AD (n=5, 50%) or changed to other diagnoses (n=5, 50%) in the
      intratemporal group, whereas it remained as AD (n=8, 61.5%) or changed to
      frontotemporal dementia (n=4, 30.8%) and other diagnoses (n=1, 7.7%) in the
      extratemporal spread group. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 70% of the patients with
      amyloid-negative AD showed abnormal [(18)F]THK-5351 retention. MMSE scores
      deteriorated rapidly in the patients with an extratemporal spread pattern.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Oral administration of cholinesterase inhibitors is often
      associated with adverse gastrointestinal effects, and so developing an
      alternative administration route, such as transdermal, is urgently needed. The
      primary objective of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of the
      IPI-301 donepezil transdermal patch compared with donepezil tablets (control) in 
      mild-to-moderate probable Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: This prospective,
      randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, two-arm parallel, multicenter trial
      included 399 patients, among whom 303 completed the trial. For randomization, the
      patients were stratified based on previous treatment and donepezil dose; patients
      in each stratum were randomized to the test and control groups at a 1:1 ratio.
      RESULTS: The difference between the control group and the IPI-301 group,
      quantified as the Hodges-Lehmann estimate of location shift, was 0.00 (95%
      confidence interval: -1.00 to 1.33), with an upper limit of less than 2.02. The
      change in Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living
      (ADCS-ADL) score differed significantly between the IPI-301 and control groups
      (p=0.02). However, the changes in the full-itemized ADCS-ADL scores at week 24
      did not differ significantly between the two groups. There were no differences
      between the two groups regarding the scores for the Clinician Interview-Based
      Impression of Change (p=0.9097), Mini-Mental State Examination (p=0.7018),
      Neuropsychiatric Inventory (p=0.7656), or Clinical Dementia Rating (p=0.9990).
      Adverse events, vital signs, and laboratory test results were comparable between 
      the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: IPI-301 was safe and efficacious in improving
      cognitive function in patients with mild-to-moderate AD.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most-common cause of neurodegenerative dementia, 
      and it is characterized by abnormal amyloid and tau accumulation, which indicates
      neurodegeneration. AD has mostly been diagnosed clinically. However,
      ligand-specific positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, such as amyloid PET, 
      and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers are needed to accurately diagnose AD,
      since they supplement the shortcomings of clinical diagnoses. Using biomarkers
      that represent the pathology of AD is essential (particularly when
      disease-modifying treatment is available) to identify the corresponding pathology
      of targeted therapy and for monitoring the treatment response. Although imaging
      and CSF biomarkers are useful, their widespread use is restricted by their high
      cost and the discomfort during the lumbar puncture, respectively. Recent advances
      in AD blood biomarkers shed light on their future use for clinical purposes. The 
      amyloid beta (Abeta)42/Abeta40 ratio and the concentrations of phosphorylated tau
      at threonine 181 and at threonine 217, and of neurofilament light in the blood
      were found to represent the pathology of Abeta, tau, and neurodegeneration in the
      brain when using automatic electrochemiluminescence technologies, single-molecule
      arrays, immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry, etc. These blood
      biomarkers are imminently expected to be incorporated into clinical practice to
      predict, diagnose, and determine the stage of AD. In this review we focus on
      advancements in the measurement technologies for blood biomarkers and the
      promising biomarkers that are approaching clinical application. We also discuss
      the current limitations, the needed further investigations, and the perspectives 
      on their use.

AB  - Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a safe and well-tolerated
      noninvasive method for stimulating the brain that is rapidly developing into a
      treatment method for various neurological and psychiatric conditions. In
      particular, there is growing evidence of a therapeutic role for tDCS in
      ameliorating or delaying the cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We
      provide a brief overview of the current development and application status of
      tDCS as a nonpharmacological therapeutic method for AD and mild cognitive
      impairment (MCI), summarize the levels of evidence, and identify the improvements
      needed for clinical applications. We also suggest future directions for
      large-scale controlled clinical trials of tDCS in AD and MCI, and emphasize the
      necessity of identifying the mechanistic targets to facilitate clinical
      applications.

LID - 10.3389/fpubh.2022.832881 [doi]
AB  - Objective: Evidence is scarce about the effect of noise exposure on the risk of
      dementia. We conducted a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis,
      aiming to explore the association between noise exposure and the risk of
      dementia. Methods: We searched PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library to collect
      studies on chronic noise exposure and the risk of dementia from database
      inception to September 18, 2021 without language limitations. Two authors
      independently screened the literature, extracted data and assessed the risk of
      bias of the included studies. A dose-response meta-analysis and subgroup analysis
      were then conducted to detect the association between noise exposure and the risk
      of dementia by using Stata 14.0 software. This study is registered on PROSPERO
      (CRD42021249243). Results: A total of 11 studies were eligible for qualitative
      synthesis, and nine were eligible for quantitative data synthesis. All of them
      showed moderate to high quality scores in the assessment of risk of bias. We
      found a positive linear association between the noise increment and dementia risk
      (R (2) = 0.58). When noise exposure increased 57 dB, the RR of dementia was 1.47 
      (95% CI: 1.21-1.78). From the outcome subgroup of AD, AD and dementia, VaD and
      NAD, we also found a positive association (R (2) = 0.68, 0.68, 0.58,
      respectively). When noise exposure increased by 25 dB, the RRs were 1.18 (95% CI:
      1.14-1.23), 1.19 (95% CI: 1.14-1.23) and 1.17 (95% CI: 1.06-1.30), respectively. 
      We found a nonlinear association between the noise increment and dementia risk
      when only cohort studies were included (R (2) = 0.58). When noise exposure
      increased by 25 dB, the RR of dementia was 1.16 (95% CI: 1.12-1.20). From the
      subgroup of AD, AD and dementia, VaD and NAD of cohort studies, the regression
      curve showed a nonlinear positive association (R (2) = 0.74, 0.71, 0.43,
      respectively). When noise exposure increased by 25 dB, the RRs were 1.17 (95% CI:
      1.12-1.21), 1.17 (95% CI: 1.12-1.22) and 1.13 (95% CI: 0.99-1.28), respectively. 
      Conclusion: Based on the current evidence, exposure to noise may be a specific
      risk factor for dementia. To better prevent dementia, more rigorously designed
      studies are needed to explore the etiological mechanism of noise and dementia.

AB  - Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is becoming a more prevalent public health
      issue in today's culture. The experimental study of Coptidis Rhizoma (CR) and its
      chemical components in AD treatment has been widely reported, but the principle
      of multi-level and multi-mechanism treatment of AD urgently needs to be
      clarified. Objective: This study focuses on network pharmacology to clarify the
      mechanism of CR's multi-target impact on Alzheimer's disease. Methods: The
      Phytochemical-compounds of CR have been accessed from the Traditional Chinese
      Medicine Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP) and Symmap database or HPLC
      determination. The values of Oral Bioavailability (OB) >/= 30% and Drug Like (DL)
      >/= 0.18 or blood ingredient were used to screen the active components of CR; the
      interactive network of targets and compounds were constructed by STRING and
      Cytoscape platform, and the network was analyzed by Molecular Complex Detection
      (MCODE); Gene Ontology (GO) function, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
      Pathway (KEGG) and metabolic pathway enrichment of targets were carried out with 
      Metascape, the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery
      (DAVID) and MetaboAnalyst platform; Based on CytoHubba, the potential efficient
      targets were screened by Maximal Clique Centrality (MCC) and Degree, the
      correlation between potential efficient targets and amyloid beta-protein (Abeta),
      Tau pathology was analyzed by Alzdata database, and the genes related to aging
      were analyzed by Aging Altas database, and finally, the core targets were
      obtained; the binding ability between ingredients and core targets evaluated by
      molecular docking, and the clinical significance of core targets was assessed
      with Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Results: 19 active components
      correspond to 267 therapeutic targets for AD, of which 69 is potentially
      effective; in module analysis, RELA, TRAF2, STAT3, and so on are the critical
      targets of each module; among the six core targets, RELA, MAPK8, STAT3, and TGFB1
      have clinical therapeutic significance; GO function, including 3050 biological
      processes (BP), 257 molecular functions (MF), 184 cellular components (CC), whose
      functions are mainly related to antioxidation, regulation of apoptosis and cell
      composition; the HIF-1 signaling pathway, glutathione metabolism is the most
      significant result of 134 KEGG signal pathways and four metabolic pathways,
      respectively; most of the active components have an excellent affinity in docking
      with critical targets. Conclusion: The pharmacological target prediction of CR
      based on molecular network pharmacology paves the way for a multi-level
      networking strategy. The study of CR in AD treatment shows a bright prospect for 
      curing neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Background: Depressive and anxiety symptoms are frequent in Alzheimer's disease
      and associated with increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease in older
      adults. We sought to examine their relationships to Alzheimer's disease
      biomarkers across the preclinical and clinical stages of the disease. Method:
      Fifty-six healthy controls, 35 patients with subjective cognitive decline and 56 
      amyloid-positive cognitively impaired patients on the Alzheimer's continuum
      completed depression and anxiety questionnaires, neuropsychological tests and
      neuroimaging assessments. We performed multiple regressions in each group
      separately to assess within group associations of depressive and anxiety symptoms
      with either cognition (global cognition and episodic memory) or neuroimaging data
      (gray matter volume, glucose metabolism and amyloid load). Results: Depressive
      symptoms, but not anxiety, were higher in patients with subjective cognitive
      decline and cognitively impaired patients on the Alzheimer's continuum compared
      to healthy controls. Greater depressive symptoms were associated with higher
      amyloid load in subjective cognitive decline patients, while they were related to
      higher cognition and glucose metabolism, and to better awareness of cognitive
      difficulties, in cognitively impaired patients on the Alzheimer's continuum. In
      contrast, anxiety symptoms were not associated with brain integrity in any group.
      Conclusion: These data show that more depressive symptoms are associated with
      greater Alzheimer's disease biomarkers in subjective cognitive decline patients, 
      while they reflect better cognitive deficit awareness in cognitively impaired
      patients on the Alzheimer's continuum. Our findings highlight the relevance of
      assessing and treating depressive symptoms in the preclinical stages of
      Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - "Reserve" refers to the individual clinical differences in response to a
      neuropathological burden. We explored the behavioral reserve (BR) and associated 
      neural substrates in 40 participants with behavioral variant frontotemporal
      dementia (bvFTD) who were assessed with the frontal behavioral inventory (FBI)
      and magnetic resonance imaging. Because neuroimaging abnormality showed a high
      negative correlation with the FBI negative (but not positive) symptom scores, we 
      developed a linear model only to calculate the nBR (BR for negative symptoms)
      marker using neuroimaging abnormalities and the FBI score. Participants were
      divided into high nBR and low nBR groups based on the nBR marker. The FBI
      negative symptom score was lower in the high nBR group than in the low nBR group 
      having the same neuroimaging abnormalities. However, the high nBR group noted a
      steeper decline in cortical atrophy and showed less atrophy in the left
      frontotemporal cortices than the low nBR group. In addition, the fractional
      anisotropy (FA) values were greater in the high nBR than in the low nBR group,
      except in the sensory-motor and occipital areas. We identified an nBR-related
      functional network composed of bilateral frontotemporal areas and the left
      occipital pole. We propose the concept of BR in bvFTD, and these findings can
      help predict the disease progression.

PG  - igac038
LID - 10.1093/geroni/igac038 [doi]
AB  - Background and Objectives: This feasibility study tests a new approach for
      assessing personal finance in older persons with early memory loss. The project
      examines 2 primary outcomes that gauge the financial viability and well-being of 
      older adults: wealth loss and financial exploitation. The overall objective is to
      determine the association of financial literacy and management, financial
      decision-making, and cognition with wealth loss and financial exploitation.
      Research Design and Methods: This cross-sectional study recruited 46 participants
      who were 60 years of age or older. Participants were classified as having mild
      cognitive impairment, perceived cognitive impairment, or no cognitive impairment.
      The study coordinator arranged with each participant to obtain copies of their
      main checking account statements for 12 consecutive months within the previous 2 
      years and, if appropriate, credit card statements. All statements were
      de-identified and assigned a random ID number. Participants then completed 2
      telephone interviews. Results: The average participant age was 72 years (standard
      deviation [SD] = 7.7); 84% were female, 39% White, and 35% currently married.
      Average education was 16.2 years (SD = 2.4); mean yearly household income was
      almost $42,000 (SD = 25,752); and monthly social security payments averaged
      $1,446 (SD = 1,244). Our results indicate that the methods used to analyze
      checking account statements, followed by telephone interviews to verify
      identified trends, were useful in developing a financial behavior index to
      measure wealth loss. Discussion and Implications: We demonstrate an alternative
      method for assessing personal finance using person-centered principles, which we 
      believe are critical in the presence of diminished or impaired cognition. Our
      findings offer an innovative method for assessing the risk for wealth loss and
      financial exploitation.

TI  - Bipolar Disorder and Manic-like Symptoms in Alzheimer's, Vascular and
      Frontotemporal Dementia: A Systematic Review.
LID - 10.2174/1570159X20666220706110157 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: An increased risk of manic episodes has been reported in patients
      with neurodegenerative disorders, but the clinical features of bipolar disorder
      (BD) in different subtypes of dementia have not been thoroughly investigated.
      OBJECTIVES: The main aim of this study is systematically review clinical and
      therapeutic evidence about manic syndromes in patients with Alzheimer's disease
      (AD), vascular dementia (VD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Since
      manic-mixed episodes have been associated with negative outcomes in patients with
      dementia and often require medical intervention, we also critically summarized
      selected studies with relevance for the treatment of mania in patients with
      cognitive decline. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was conducted
      according to PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases were 
      searched up to February 2022. Sixty-one articles on patients with AD, VaD or FTD 
      and BD or (hypo)mania have been included. RESULTS: Manic symptoms seem to be
      associated with disease progression in AD, have a greatly variable temporal
      relationship with cognitive decline in VaD, and frequently coincides with or
      precedes cognitive impairment in FTD. Overall, mood stabilizers and
      electroconvulsive therapy may be the most effective treatments, while the
      benefits of short-term treatment with antipsychotic agents must be balanced with 
      the associated risks. Importantly, low-dose lithium salts may exert a
      neuroprotective activity in patients with AD. CONCLUSION: Prevalence, clinical
      features and treatment response to pharmacotherapy of manic syndromes in patients
      with dementia may be differentially affected by the nature of the underlying
      neurodegenerative conditions.

TI  - Terminal complement pathway activation drives synaptic loss in Alzheimer's
      disease models.

AB  - Complement is involved in developmental synaptic pruning and pathological synapse
      loss in Alzheimer's disease. It is posited that C1 binding initiates complement
      activation on synapses; C3 fragments then tag them for microglial phagocytosis.
      However, the precise mechanisms of complement-mediated synaptic loss remain
      unclear, and the role of the lytic membrane attack complex (MAC) is unexplored.
      We here address several knowledge gaps: (i) is complement activated through to
      MAC at the synapse? (ii) does MAC contribute to synaptic loss? (iii) can MAC
      inhibition prevent synaptic loss? Novel methods were developed and optimised to
      quantify C1q, C3 fragments and MAC in total and regional brain homogenates and
      synaptoneurosomes from WT and App(NL-G-F) Alzheimer's disease model mouse brains 
      at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of age. The impact on synapse loss of systemic treatment
      with a MAC blocking antibody and gene knockout of a MAC component was assessed in
      Alzheimer's disease model mice. A significant increase in C1q, C3 fragments and
      MAC was observed in App(NL-G-F) mice compared to controls, increasing with age
      and severity. Administration of anti-C7 antibody to App(NL-G-F) mice modulated
      synapse loss, reflected by the density of dendritic spines in the vicinity of
      plaques. Constitutive knockout of C6 significantly reduced synapse loss in
      3xTg-AD mice. We demonstrate that complement dysregulation occurs in Alzheimer's 
      disease mice involving the activation (C1q; C3b/iC3b) and terminal (MAC) pathways
      in brain areas associated with pathology. Inhibition or ablation of MAC formation
      reduced synapse loss in two Alzheimer's disease mouse models, demonstrating that 
      MAC formation is a driver of synapse loss. We suggest that MAC directly damages
      synapses, analogous to neuromuscular junction destruction in myasthenia gravis.

TI  - Molecular landscapes of human hippocampal immature neurons across lifespan.
PG  - 527-533
LID - 10.1038/s41586-022-04912-w [doi]
AB  - Immature dentate granule cells (imGCs) arising from adult hippocampal
      neurogenesis contribute to plasticity and unique brain functions in rodents(1,2) 
      and are dysregulated in multiple human neurological disorders(3-5). Little is
      known about the molecular characteristics of adult human hippocampal imGCs, and
      even their existence is under debate(1,6-8). Here we performed single-nucleus RNA
      sequencing aided by a validated machine learning-based analytic approach to
      identify imGCs and quantify their abundance in the human hippocampus at different
      stages across the lifespan. We identified common molecular hallmarks of human
      imGCs across the lifespan and observed age-dependent transcriptional dynamics in 
      human imGCs that suggest changes in cellular functionality, niche interactions
      and disease relevance, that differ from those in mice(9). We also found a
      decreased number of imGCs with altered gene expression in Alzheimer's disease.
      Finally, we demonstrated the capacity for neurogenesis in the adult human
      hippocampus with the presence of rare dentate granule cell fate-specific
      proliferating neural progenitors and with cultured surgical specimens. Together, 
      our findings suggest the presence of a substantial number of imGCs in the adult
      human hippocampus via low-frequency de novo generation and protracted maturation,
      and our study reveals their molecular properties across the lifespan and in
      Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Perivascular spaces (PVS) drain brain waste metabolites, but their specific flow 
      paths are debated. Meningeal pia mater reportedly forms the outermost boundary
      that confines flow around blood vessels. Yet, we show that pia is perforated and 
      permissive to PVS fluid flow. Furthermore, we demonstrate that pia is comprised
      of vascular and cerebral layers that coalesce in variable patterns along
      leptomeningeal arteries, often merging around penetrating arterioles.
      Heterogeneous pial architectures form variable sieve-like structures that
      differentially influence cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) transport along PVS. The
      degree of pial coverage correlates with macrophage density and phagocytosis of
      CSF tracer. In vivo imaging confirms transpial influx of CSF tracer, suggesting a
      role of pia in CSF filtration, but not flow restriction. Additionally, pial
      layers atrophy with age. Old mice also exhibit areas of pial denudation that are 
      not observed in young animals, but pia is unexpectedly hypertrophied in a mouse
      model of Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, pial thickness correlates with improved
      CSF flow and reduced beta-amyloid deposits in PVS of old mice. We show that PVS
      morphology in mice is variable and that the structure and function of pia
      suggests a previously unrecognized role in regulating CSF transport and amyloid
      clearance in aging and disease.

TI  - Preoperative Plasma Tau-PT217 and Tau-PT181 Are Associated With Postoperative
      Delirium.
LID - 10.1097/SLA.0000000000005487 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify blood biomarkers of postoperative
      delirium. BACKGROUND: Phosphorylated tau at threonine 217 (Tau-PT217) and 181
      (Tau-PT181) are new Alzheimer disease biomarkers. Postoperative delirium is
      associated with Alzheimer disease. We assessed associations between Tau-PT217 or 
      Tau-PT181 and postoperative delirium. METHODS: Of 491 patients (65 years old or
      older) who had a knee replacement, hip replacement, or laminectomy, 139
      participants were eligible and included in the analysis. Presence and severity of
      postoperative delirium were assessed in the patients. Preoperative plasma
      concentrations of Tau-PT217 and Tau-PT181 were determined by a newly established 
      Nanoneedle technology. RESULTS: Of 139 participants (73+/-6 years old, 55%
      female), 18 (13%) developed postoperative delirium. Participants who developed
      postoperative delirium had higher preoperative plasma concentrations of Tau-PT217
      and Tau-PT181 than participants who did not. Preoperative plasma concentrations
      of Tau-PT217 or Tau-PT181 were independently associated with postoperative
      delirium after adjusting for age, education, and preoperative Mini-Mental State
      score [odds ratio (OR) per unit change in the biomarker: 2.05, 95% confidence
      interval (CI):1.61-2.62, P<0.001 for Tau-PT217; and OR: 4.12; 95% CI: 2.55--6.67,
      P<0.001 for Tau-PT181]. The areas under the receiver operating curve for
      predicting delirium were 0.969 (Tau-PT217) and 0.885 (Tau-PT181). The
      preoperative plasma concentrations of Tau-PT217 or Tau-PT181 were also associated
      with delirium severity [beta coefficient (beta) per unit change in the biomarker:
      0.14; 95% CI: 0.09-0.19, P<0.001 for Tau-PT217; and beta: 0.41; 95% CI:
      0.12-0.70, P=0.006 for Tau-PT181). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative plasma
      concentrations of Tau-PT217 and Tau-PT181 were associated with postoperative
      delirium, with Tau-PT217 being a stronger indicator of postoperative delirium
      than Tau-PT181.

AB  - Ubiquitin conjugating enzyme 9 (UBC9), the sole small ubiquitin-like
      modifier(SUMO) conjugating enzyme, is considered to be a vital regulator of the
      mechanism of SUMOylation and is likely to participate in the progression of
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our previous studies found that UBC9 is highly mobile
      in neurons, but the underlying mechanism is still unknown. We designed to
      investigate the underlying mechanism of the synaptic redistribution of UBC9 in
      AD. We found that beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) significantly decreased
      presynaptic UBC9 expression and increased postsynaptic UBC9 expression but did
      not affect UBC9 expression in synaptosomes. Moreover, there is evidence that
      extracellular vesicles (EVs) may facilitate synaptic gap transmission.
      Immunoprecipitation assays showed that flotillin, which is specifically expressed
      in EVs, co-immunoprecipitated with UBC9 in cell lysates and media and that Abeta 
      treatment enhanced this interaction. Additionally, epidermal growth factor and
      oleanolic acid have been found to either promote or inhibit the release of EVs,
      thus blocking the Abeta-induced presynaptic release of UBC9. However, knockdown
      of synaptosome associated protein 23 (SNAP-23) or inhibition of SNAP23
      phosphorylation was found to secure Abeta-induced presynaptic release of UBC9.
      These results suggest that Abeta induces redistribution of UBC9 from presynaptic 
      to postsynaptic terminals, which may mediate through EVs associated with SNAP23. 
      Our study reveals the cellular mechanisms of EVs as an essential component of the
      presynaptic release of UBC9.

AB  - The cause of age-related body weight loss in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is unclear.
      We compared the differences in food intake, malabsorption, locomotor activity,
      and gut microbiota composition between 5xFAD mice, a useful model of AD, and
      wild-type (WT) mice to investigate the mechanisms underlying lower body weight in
      5xFAD mice. Fifteen-month-old male 5xFAD mice and age-matched WT mice were
      divided into four groups: a control diet (CD) or a high-fat diet (HFD). After
      feeding CD or HFD for eight to nine weeks, 5xFAD mice had a significantly lower
      body weight than WT mice regardless of diet (p < 0.05). Additionally, the 5xFAD
      mice did not show a reduction in food intake compared to the WT mice regardless
      of diet. To evaluate malabsorption, we performed a fecal fat test. There was no
      obvious fecal fat in both the 5xFAD mice and WT mice. However, 5xFAD mice showed 
      greater locomotor activity than WT mice in the Y-maze test. The comprehensive
      analysis of gut microbiota composition showed that 15-month-old 5xFAD mice had
      more Proteobacteria population and fewer Actinobacteria and Bifidobacteriales
      populations than WT mice. To investigate the effects of fructooligosaccharides
      (FOS), we administrated FOS to 15-month-old 5xFAD mice. FOS administration
      decreased Proteobacteria and increased Actinobacteria population, although that
      did not change Bifidobacteriales population. Moreover, cognitive impairment and
      body weight of 5xFAD mice were not changed by FOS administration. In conclusion, 
      loss of body weight in 15-month-old 5xFAD mice might be partially derived from
      excess energy output by hyperactivity. Moreover, 15-month-old 5xFAD mice might
      have unique alteration of gut microbiota composition and the potential resistance
      to FOS.

AB  - Tannic acid (TA) is a natural compound present abundantly in fruit such as grapes
      and green tea. In this study, we have evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of TA
      against Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced oxidative stress-mediated memory
      impairment, neuroinflammation, insulin signaling impairment, and Amyloid Beta
      (Abeta) deposition in adult male mice. The LPS was administered once per week and
      TA twice a week to adult male mice for three months consecutively. Behavioral
      studies were performed using different behavioral models such as balance beam,
      novel object recognition (NOR), Morris water maze (MWM), and Y-maze tests. The
      protein expression of different mediators such as TNF-alpha, p-JNK, pIRS636,
      BACE1, APP, and Abeta was evaluated through western blot and immunofluorescence
      staining techniques. Biochemical assays were carried out to assess the
      antioxidant activities of TA. The computational study was conducted to predict
      the binding mode of TA with target sites of TNF-alpha. Behavioral studies showed 
      that the TA-treated mice exhibited gradual memory improvement. TA significantly
      inhibited BACE1 activity and reduced production and accumulation of Abeta in the 
      hippocampus of mice brains. Moreover, the TA significantly inhibited LPS-induced 
      ROS production and enhanced the glutathione levels. Furthermore, we have shown
      via the computational method for the first time that TA inhibits LPS-triggered
      TNF- and its downstream signaling to reduce AD pathology including memory
      impairment, neuroinflammation, insulin signaling impairment, and Abeta deposition
      in adult mice. Taken together our current study demonstrates that TA is a
      potential candidate for the abrogation of LPS-induced neurotoxicity and AD
      pathology in rodent's models.

LID - 10.3881/j.issn.1000-503X.14483 [doi]
AB  - Objective To explore the effects of interleukin-6 (IL-6) gene knockout on the
      cognitive function and pathological changes in 5xFAD transgenic mice of
      Alzheimer's disease.Methods IL-6(+/-) mice were crossed with 5xFAD mice to
      establish the 5xFAD;IL-6(-/-) mouse model,and 3-month-old and 10-month-old mice
      were selected for experiments.The cognitive function of mice was detected by
      behavioral tests,and HE staining and beta-amyloid (Abeta) immunohistochemical
      staining were performed to detect the pathological changes of mouse brain
      tissue.Results The number of 5xFAD;IL-6(-/-) model mice (3 months old,n=20;10
      months old,n=5) and 5xFAD littermate control (3 months old,n=26;10 months
      old,n=24) conformed to the Mendel's law.Compared with that of the 5xFAD mice at
      the same age,the discrimination ratio of 3-month-old 5xFAD;IL-6(-/-) mice
      increased in the novel object recognition test (q=3.890,P=0.002).Morris water
      maze test results showed that the 3-month-old 5xFAD;IL-6(-/-) mice had longer
      time spent in target quadrant (q=3.797,P=0.012) and more times of crossing
      platform (q=2.505,P=0.017) than the 5xFAD mice at the same age.The results of
      immunohistochemical staining showed that IL-6 knockout reduced the Abeta
      deposition in the hippocampus (q=13.490,P=0.002;q=45.680,P<0.001) and cortex
      (q=16.830,P=0.001;q=14.180,P=0.001) of 5xFAD mice.Conclusion IL-6 gene knockout
      can significantly improve the spatial memory and reduce the Abeta deposition in
      the brain of 5xFAD mice.

      Relationship to markers of vascular and Alzheimer's pathology.
LID - 10.1002/alz.12727 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) reflects the balance between
      oxygen delivery and consumption. We longitudinally measured OEF in older adults
      to examine the relationship with markers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular
      pathology. METHODS: One hundred thirty-seven participants were studied at two
      time-points at an interval of 2.16 years. OEF was measured using T2
      -relaxation-under-spin-tagging (TRUST) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The
      association between OEF and vascular risks, white matter hyperintensities (WMH), 
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measures of amyloid beta (Abeta), total tau (t-tau),
      and phosphorylated tau 181 (p-tau181) was examined. RESULTS: OEF increased from
      baseline to follow-up. The increase in OEF was more prominent in individuals with
      high vascular risks compared to those with low vascular risks, and was associated
      with progression of vascular risks and the growth in WMH volume. OEF change was
      not related to CSF markers of AD pathology or their progression. DISCUSSION:
      Longitudinal OEF change in older adults is primarily related to vascular
      pathology.

TI  - Toward rational use of cognitive training in those with mild cognitive
      impairment.
LID - 10.1002/alz.12718 [doi]
AB  - The term cognitive training includes a range of techniques that hold potential
      for treating cognitive impairment caused by neurologic injury and disease. Our
      central premise is that these techniques differ in their mechanisms of action and
      therefore engage distinct brain regions (or neural networks). We support this
      premise using data from a single-blind randomized-controlled trial in which
      patients with mild cognitive impairment were randomized to either mnemonic
      strategy training (MST) or spaced retrieval training (SRT) as they learned
      ecologically relevant object-location associations. Both training approaches were
      highly effective in the short term, but MST demonstrated a clear advantage after 
      days to weeks. MST also increased activation in and functional connectivity
      between frontal, temporal, and parietal regions as well as the hippocampus. In
      contrast, patterns of reduced activation and functional connectivity were evident
      following SRT. These findings support the rational development of cognitive
      training techniques.

TI  - Neuron-specific translational control shift ensures proteostatic resilience
      during ER stress.
PG  - e110501
LID - 10.15252/embj.2021110501 [doi]
AB  - Proteostasis is essential for cellular survival and particularly important for
      highly specialised post-mitotic cells such as neurons. Transient reduction in
      protein synthesis by protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum (ER) kinase
      (PERK)-mediated phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor
      2alpha (p-eIF2alpha) is a major proteostatic survival response during ER stress. 
      Paradoxically, neurons are remarkably tolerant to PERK dysfunction, which
      suggests the existence of cell type-specific mechanisms that secure proteostatic 
      stress resilience. Here, we demonstrate that PERK-deficient neurons, unlike other
      cell types, fully retain the capacity to control translation during ER stress. We
      observe rescaling of the ATF4 response, while the reduction in protein synthesis 
      is fully retained. We identify two molecular pathways that jointly drive
      translational control in PERK-deficient neurons. Haem-regulated inhibitor (HRI)
      mediates p-eIF2alpha and the ATF4 response and is complemented by the tRNA
      cleaving RNase angiogenin (ANG) to reduce protein synthesis. Overall, our study
      elucidates an intricate back-up mechanism to ascertain translational control
      during ER stress in neurons that provides a mechanistic explanation for the thus 
      far unresolved observation of neuronal resilience to proteostatic stress.

TI  - Effect of chlorogenic acid plus donepezil on critical neurocortical enzyme

      scopolamine-assaulted rats, supported by multiple ligand simultaneous docking.
PG  - e14312
LID - 10.1111/jfbc.14312 [doi]
AB  - The effect of chlorogenic acid (a natural phenolic acid ubiquitous in plant
      foods) on selected therapeutic properties of donepezil (DON) in a scopolamine
      (SCOP)-induced rat model of amnesia was the focus of this study. Adult albino
      (Wister strain) rats were allocated into five groups (n = 11) consisting of
      control, SCOP, SCOP + chlorogenic acid (CGA), SCOP + DON, and SCOP + CGA + DON
      for 7 days. Post-treatment, the rat brain cerebral cortex homogenate was assayed 
      for cholinesterase and monoamine oxidase activities. Also, the reactive oxygen
      species, total thiol and nitric oxide contents, alongside catalase, and
      superoxide dismutase activities were determined. Routine histology for neuronal
      and glial cells as well as synaptophysin immunoreactivity was also carried out on
      the cerebral cortex. Thereafter, multiple ligand simultaneous docking was carried
      out for DON and CGA at the active sites of AChE and BChE. The results revealed
      that the biochemical parameters, glial cells, and synaptophysin immunoreactivity 
      were significantly impaired in the cerebral cortex of scopolamine-treated rats.
      However, impaired butyrylcholinesterase and monoamine oxidase activity, together 
      with antioxidant, glial cells, and synaptophysin levels were significantly
      ameliorated in scopolamine-treated rats administered DON + CGA compared to
      donepezil alone. The docking of both DON and CGA at the active sites of AChE or
      BChE showed higher binding energy to both enzymes compared to individual
      interactions of either DON or CGA. Hence, this study has been able to show that
      CGA could improve some of the therapeutic effects of DON, which could broaden the
      therapeutic spectrum of this drug. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: This study showed that
      chlorogenic acid (a major phenolic acid found in plant foods such as coffee)
      modulated some of the therapeutic properties of donepezil (an anticholinesterase 
      drug used in the treatment of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease). The
      combinations elicited better anti-butyrylcholinesterase, antimonoamine oxidase,
      and antioxidant properties, thus presenting this food-drug interaction as
      potentially able to offer better therapeutic properties.

PG  - 741-745
AB  - To evaluate the efficacy and safety of sodium oligomannate in the treatment of
      Alzheimer's disease. Patients with mild-to-moderate AD were randomly divided into
      three groups, the scores of ADAS-Cog, ADL, CIBIC-plus, NPI and CSDD were
      evaluated at the 0th, 12th, 24th, 36th and 48th weeks of medication. Comparing
      the mean scores of each scale in each cycle of each group. Using SPSS21.0
      software for measurement data using t test, Chi-square test was used for counting
      data. A total of 72 patients with AD were included. The difference of CIBIC-plus 
      score at week 12(P=0.007) and 24(P=0.005), ADAS-Cog scores (P=0.01) at week 24 in
      GV-971 group was statistically significant compared with that in the control
      group. The CIBIC-plus score at week 24(P=0.01) and week 48 (P=0.04), CSDD scores 
      at week 48(P=0.02) of GV-971 group was statistically significant compared with
      that of donepezil group. There were 2 cases of adverse reaction of increased
      stool frequency in GV-971 (5.67%), and 2 cases of adverse reaction of nausea in
      donepezil group (8.33%), the difference was statistically significant. GV-971 is 
      as effective as donepezil in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, and may even
      be better. It has good safety.

TI  - Postsecondary Education and Late-life Cognitive Outcomes Among Black and White
      Participants in the Project Talent Aging Study: Can Early-life Cognitive Skills
      Account for Educational Differences in Late-life Cognition?
LID - 10.1097/WAD.0000000000000519 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Higher education consistently predicts improved late-life cognition. 
      Racial differences in educational attainment likely contribute to inequities in
      dementia risk. However, few studies of education and cognition have controlled
      for prospectively measured early-life confounders or evaluated whether the
      education late-life cognition association is modified by race/ethnicity. METHODS:
      Among 2343 Black and White Project Talent Aging Study participants who completed 
      telephone cognitive assessments, we evaluated whether the association between
      years of education and cognition (verbal fluency, memory/recall, attention, and a
      composite cognitive measure) differed by race, and whether these differences
      persisted when adjusting for childhood factors, including the cognitive ability. 
      RESULTS: In fully adjusted linear regression models, each additional year of
      education was associated with higher composite cognitive scores for Black
      [beta=0.137; 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.068, 0.206] and White respondents
      (beta=0.056; CI=0.034, 0.078) with an interaction with race (P=0.03).
      Associations between education and memory/recall among Black adults (beta=0.036; 
      CI=-0.037, 0.109) and attention among White adults (beta=0.022; CI=-0.002, 0.046)
      were nonsignificant. However, there were significant race-education interactions 
      for the composite (P=0.03) and attention measures (P<0.001) but not verbal
      fluency (P=0.61) or memory/recall (P=0.95). CONCLUSION: Education predicted
      better overall cognition for both Black and White adults, even with stringent
      control for prospectively measured early-life confounders.

TI  - Virtual Screening and Testing of GSK-3 Inhibitors Using Human SH-SY5Y Cells
      Expressing Tau Folding Reporter and Mouse Hippocampal Primary Culture under Tau
      Cytotoxicity.
LID - 10.4062/biomolther.2022.035 [doi]
AB  - Glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) is an important serine/threonine
      kinase that implicates in multiple cellular processes and links with the
      neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study,
      structure-based virtual screening was performed to search database for compounds 
      targeting GSK-3beta from Enamine's screening collection. Of the top-ranked
      compounds, 7 primary hits underwent a luminescent kinase assay and a cell assay
      using human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells expressing Tau repeat domain (TauRD) with
      pro-aggregant mutation DeltaK280. In the kinase assay for these 7 compounds,
      residual GSK-3beta activities ranged from 36.1% to 90.0% were detected at the
      IC50 of SB-216763. In the cell assay, only compounds VB-030 and VB-037 reduced
      Tau aggregation in SH-SY5Y cells expressing DeltaK280 TauRD-DsRed folding
      reporter. In SH-SY5Y cells expressing DeltaK280 TauRD, neither VB-030 nor VB-037 
      increased expression of GSK-3alpha Ser21 or GSK-3beta Ser9. Among extracellular
      signal-regulated kinase (ERK), AKT serine/threonine kinase 1 (AKT),
      mitogen-activated protein kinase 14 (P38) and mitogenactivated protein kinase 8
      (JNK) which modulate Tau phosphorylation, VB-037 attenuated active
      phosphorylation of P38 Thr180/ Tyr182, whereas VB-030 had no effect on the
      phosphorylation status of ERK, AKT, P38 or JNK. However, both VB-030 and VB-037
      reduced endogenous Tau phosphorylation at Ser202, Thr231, Ser396 and Ser404 in
      neuronally differentiated SH-SY5Y expressing DeltaK280 TauRD. In addition, VB-030
      and VB-037 further improved neuronal survival and/or neurite length and branch in
      mouse hippocampal primary culture under Tau cytotoxicity. Overall, through
      inhibiting GSK-3beta kinase activity and/or p-P38 (Thr180/Tyr182), both compounds
      may serve as promising candidates to reduce Tau aggregation/cytotoxicity for AD
      treatment.

TI  - Cognitive and neuropsychiatric effects of noradrenergic treatment in Alzheimer's 
      disease: systematic review and meta-analysis.
LID - jnnp-2022-329136 [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dysfunction of the locus coeruleus-noradrenergic system occurs early 
      in Alzheimer's disease, contributing to cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms
      in some patients. This system offers a potential therapeutic target, although
      noradrenergic treatments are not currently used in clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: 
      To assess the efficacy of drugs with principally noradrenergic action in
      improving cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease.
      METHODS: The MEDLINE, Embase and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched from 
      1980 to December 2021. We generated pooled estimates using random effects
      meta-analyses. RESULTS: We included 19 randomised controlled trials (1811
      patients), of which six were judged as 'good' quality, seven as 'fair' and six
      'poor'. Meta-analysis of 10 of these studies (1300 patients) showed a significant
      small positive effect of noradrenergic drugs on global cognition, measured using 
      the Mini-Mental State Examination or Alzheimer's Disease Assessment
      Scale-Cognitive Subscale (standardised mean difference (SMD): 0.14, 95% CI: 0.03 
      to 0.25, p=0.01; I(2)=0%). No significant effect was seen on measures of
      attention (SMD: 0.01, 95% CI: -0.17 to 0.19, p=0.91; I(2)=0). The apathy
      meta-analysis included eight trials (425 patients) and detected a large positive 
      effect of noradrenergic drugs (SMD: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.16 to 0.73, p=0.002;
      I(2)=58%). This positive effect was still present following removal of outliers
      to account for heterogeneity across studies. DISCUSSION: Repurposing of
      established noradrenergic drugs is most likely to offer effective treatment in
      Alzheimer's disease for general cognition and apathy. However, several factors
      should be considered before designing future clinical trials. These include
      targeting of appropriate patient subgroups and understanding the dose effects of 
      individual drugs and their interactions with other treatments to minimise risks
      and maximise therapeutic effects. PROSPERO REGISTERATION NUMBER: CRD42021277500.

TI  - Anthocyanin-rich blackcurrant extract improves long-term memory impairment and
      emotional abnormality in senescence-accelerated mice.
LID - 10.1111/jfbc.14295 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with a progressive worsening in cognitive 
      function, which is often accompanied by emotional disturbance. Recent studies
      revealed that anthocyanin-rich blackcurrant extract (BCE) can impart health
      benefits, but it is not known whether BCE is useful in the prevention and/or
      treatment of AD. Here, we examined the effects of BCE using a
      senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) model. Dietary BCE supplementation
      for 9 weeks was found to both improve the diminished long-term recognition memory
      and normalize the anxiety levels of SAMP8 mice. RNA sequencing demonstrated that 
      dietary supplementation with anthocyanin-rich BCE significantly altered the gene 
      expression profile in the hippocampus. According to enrichment analysis, genes
      regulated by BCE were related to cellular component terms such as "smooth
      endoplasmic reticulum," "axon," and "glutamatergic synapse." Real-time PCR
      verified alterations in the expression of AD-related genes. These findings
      indicate that anthocyanin-rich BCE may be valuable for the prevention and/or
      treatment of AD. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Blackcurrant contains an abundance of
      polyphenols, especially anthocyanins. This study demonstrated that
      anthocyanin-rich BCE improves the long-term recognition memory impairment and
      emotional abnormality of SAMP8 mice, a mouse model characterized by several
      pathological features of AD. These findings indicate that anthocyanin-rich BCE
      may be a useful food supplement or ingredient for the prevention of AD.

TI  - Detection of Brain Tau Pathology in Down Syndrome Using Plasma Biomarkers.
LID - 10.1001/jamaneurol.2022.1740 [doi]
AB  - Importance: Novel plasma biomarkers, especially phosphorylated tau (p-tau), can
      detect brain tau aggregates in Alzheimer disease. Objective: To determine which
      plasma biomarker combinations can accurately detect tau pathological brain
      changes in Down syndrome (DS). Design, Setting, and Participants: The
      cross-sectional, multicenter Alzheimer's Biomarker Consortium-Down Syndrome study
      included adults with DS and a control group of siblings without DS. All
      participants with plasma, positron emission tomography (PET), and cognitive
      measures available by the time of data freeze 1.0 were included. Participants
      were enrolled between 2016 and 2019, and data were analyzed from August 2021 to
      April 2022. Exposures: Plasma p-tau217, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP),
      amyloid beta42/40 (Abeta42/Abeta40), neurofilament light (NfL), and total tau
      (t-tau); tau positron emission tomography (tau-PET) and Abeta-PET. Main Outcomes 
      and Measures: The primary outcome was tau-PET status. Secondary outcomes included
      Abeta-PET status and cognitive performance. Results: Among 300 participants with 
      DS and a control group of 37 non-DS siblings, mean (SD) age was 45.0 (10.1)
      years, and 167 (49.6%) were men. Among participants with DS who all underwent
      plasma p-tau217 and GFAP analyses, 258 had other plasma biomarker data available 
      and 119, 213, and 288 participants had tau-PET, Abeta-PET, and cognitive
      assessments, respectively. Plasma p-tau217 and t-tau were significantly increased
      in Abeta-PET-positive tau-PET-positive (A+T+) DS and A+T- DS compared with A-T-
      DS while GFAP was only increased in A+T+ DS. Plasma p-tau217 levels were also
      significantly higher in A+T+ DS than A+T- DS. In participants with DS, plasma
      p-tau217 and GFAP (but not other plasma biomarkers) were consistently associated 
      with abnormal tau-PET and Abeta-PET status in models covaried for age (odds ratio
      range, 1.59 [95% CI, 1.05-2.40] to 2.32 [95% CI, 1.36-3.96]; P < .03). A
      combination of p-tau217 and age performed best when detecting tau-PET abnormality
      in temporal and neocortical regions (area under the curve [AUC] range,
      0.96-0.99). The most parsimonious model for Abeta-PET status included p-tau217,
      t-tau, and age (AUC range, 0.93-0.95). In multivariable models, higher p-tau217
      levels but not other biomarkers were associated with worse performance on DS
      Mental Status Examination (beta, -0.24, 95% CI, -0.36 to -0.12; P < .001) and
      Cued Recall Test (beta, -0.40; 95% CI, -0.53 to -0.26; P < .001). Conclusions and
      Relevance: Plasma p-tau217 is a very accurate blood-based biomarker of both tau
      and Abeta pathological brain changes in DS that could help guide screening and
      enrichment strategies for inclusion of individuals with DS in future AD clinical 
      trials, especially when it is combined with age as a covariate.

LID - 10.1002/anie.202206894 [doi]
AB  - Peroxynitrite (ONOO(-) ) plays a critical role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). To
      reveal the ONOO(-) influx in AD brains, an activatable activity-based
      fluorescence probe Rd-DPA3 was designed by a structure-modulated strategy. Taking
      advantage of ONOO(-) -initiated two-step cascade reactions of a novel chemical
      trigger, Rd-DPA3 specifically responds to ONOO(-) in 0.3 mM of other reactive
      oxygen species (ROS) and varied proteins, and gives an intensive fluorescence
      enhancement (F/F0 =50). Moreover, with its mitochondria-targeting ability,
      Rd-DPA3 can be used to efficiently monitor the alternations of intracellular
      ONOO(-) levels in cerebral cells during oxidative stress. Significantly, due to
      NIR emission and good blood-brain barrier (BBB) crossing ability, Rd-DPA3 is
      suitable for in vivo imaging of cerebral ONOO(-) influx and illustrating an
      age-dependent accumulation of ONOO(-) in AD mice brains.

TI  - SORL1 gene mutation and octapeptide repeat insertion in PRNP gene in a case
      presenting with rapidly progressive dementia and cerebral amyloid angiopathy.
LID - 10.1111/ene.15487 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) has been associated
      with a variety of neurodegenerative disorders, included prion diseases and
      Alzheimer's disease; its pathophysiology is still largely unknown. We report the 
      case of an 80-year-old man with rapidly progressive dementia and neuroimaging
      features consistent with CAA carrying two genetic defects in the PRNP and SORL1
      genes. METHODS: Neurological examination, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
      electroencephalographic-electromyographic (EEG-EMG) polygraphy, and analysis of
      14-3-3 and tau proteins, Abeta40, and Abeta42 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
      were performed. The patient underwent a detailed genetic study by next generation
      sequencing analysis. RESULTS: The patient presented with progressive cognitive
      dysfunction, generalized myoclonus, and ataxia. Approximately 9 months after
      symptom onset, he was bed-bound, almost mute, and akinetic. Brain MRI was
      consistent with CAA. CSF analysis showed high levels of t-tau and p-tau,
      decreased Abeta42, decreased Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio, and absence of 14.3.3
      protein. EEG-EMG polygraphy demonstrated diffuse slowing, frontal theta activity,
      and generalized spike-waves related to upper limb myoclonus induced by
      intermittent photic stimulation. Genetic tests revealed the presence of the E270K
      variant in the SORL1 gene and the presence of a single octapeptide repeat
      insertion in the coding region of the PRNP gene. CONCLUSIONS: The specific
      pathogenic contribution of the two DNA variations is difficult to determine
      without neuropathology; among the possible explanations, we discuss the
      possibility of their link with CAA. Vascular and degenerative pathways actually
      interact in a synergistic way, and genetic studies may lead to more insight into 
      pathophysiological mechanisms.

TI  - A locus at 19q13.31 significantly reduces the ApoE epsilon4 risk for Alzheimer's 
      Disease in African Ancestry.
PG  - e1009977
LID - 10.1371/journal.pgen.1009977 [doi]
AB  - African descent populations have a lower Alzheimer disease risk from ApoE
      epsilon4 compared to other populations. Ancestry analysis showed that the
      difference in risk between African and European populations lies in the ancestral
      genomic background surrounding the ApoE locus (local ancestry). Identifying the
      mechanism(s) of this protection could lead to greater insight into the etiology
      of Alzheimer disease and more personalized therapeutic intervention. Our
      objective is to follow up the local ancestry finding and identify the genetic
      variants that drive this risk difference and result in a lower risk for
      developing Alzheimer disease in African ancestry populations. We performed
      association analyses using a logistic regression model with the ApoE epsilon4
      allele as an interaction term and adjusted for genome-wide ancestry, age, and
      sex. Discovery analysis included imputed SNP data of 1,850 Alzheimer disease and 
      4,331 cognitively intact African American individuals. We performed replication
      analyses on 63 whole genome sequenced Alzheimer disease and 648 cognitively
      intact Ibadan individuals. Additionally, we reproduced results using whole-genome
      sequencing of 273 Alzheimer disease and 275 cognitively intact admixed Puerto
      Rican individuals. A further comparison was done with SNP imputation from an
      additional 8,463 Alzheimer disease and 11,365 cognitively intact non-Hispanic
      White individuals. We identified a significant interaction between the ApoE
      epsilon4 allele and the SNP rs10423769_A allele, (beta = -0.54,SE = 0.12,p-value 
      = 7.50x10-6) in the discovery data set, and replicated this finding in Ibadan
      (beta = -1.32,SE = 0.52,p-value = 1.15x10-2) and Puerto Rican (beta = -1.27,SE = 
      0.64,p-value = 4.91x10-2) individuals. The non-Hispanic Whites analyses showed an
      interaction trending in the "protective" direction but failing to pass a 0.05
      significance threshold (beta = -1.51,SE = 0.84,p-value = 7.26x10-2). The presence
      of the rs10423769_A allele reduces the odds ratio for Alzheimer disease risk from
      7.2 for ApoE epsilon4/epsilon4 carriers lacking the A allele to 2.1 for ApoE
      epsilon4/epsilon4 carriers with at least one A allele. This locus is located
      approximately 2 mB upstream of the ApoE locus, in a large cluster of pregnancy
      specific beta-1 glycoproteins on chromosome 19 and lies within a long noncoding
      RNA, ENSG00000282943. This study identified a new African-ancestry specific locus
      that reduces the risk effect of ApoE epsilon4 for developing Alzheimer disease.
      The mechanism of the interaction with ApoEepsilon4 is not known but suggests a
      novel mechanism for reducing the risk for epsilon4 carriers opening the
      possibility for potential ancestry-specific therapeutic intervention.

AB  - Emerging evidence has linked Alzheimer's disease (AD) onset with musculoskeletal 
      aging via a muscle-brain crosstalk mediated by dysregulation of the mitochondrial
      microenvironment. This study investigated gene expression profiles from skeletal 
      muscle tissues of older healthy adults to identify potential gene biomarkers
      whose dysregulated expression and protein interactome were involved in AD.
      Screening of the literature resulted in 12 relevant microarray datasets
      (GSE25941, GSE28392, GSE28422, GSE47881, GSE47969, GSE59880) in musculoskeletal
      aging and (GSE4757, GSE5281, GSE16759, GSE28146, GSE48350, GSE84422) in AD.
      Retrieved differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were used to construct two unique
      protein-protein interaction networks and clustering gene modules were identified.
      Overlapping module DEGs in the musculoskeletal aging and AD networks were ranked 
      based on 11 topological algorithms and the five highest-ranked ones were
      considered as hub genes. The analysis revealed that the dysregulated expression
      of the mitochondrial microenvironment genes, NDUFAB1, UQCRC1, UQCRFS1, NDUFS3,
      and MRPL15, overlapped between both musculoskeletal aging and AD networks. Thus, 
      these genes may have a potential role as markers of AD occurrence in
      musculoskeletal aging. Human studies are warranted to evaluate the functional
      role and prognostic value of these genes in aging populations with sarcopenia and
      AD.

AB  - Although the link between microbial infections and Alzheimer's disease (AD) has
      been demonstrated in multiple studies, the involvement of pathogens in the
      development of AD remains unclear. Here, we investigated the frequency of the 10 
      most commonly cited viral (HSV-1, EBV, HHV-6, HHV-7, and CMV) and bacterial
      (Chlamydia pneumoniae, Helicobacter pylori, Borrelia burgdorferi, Porphyromonas
      gingivalis, and Treponema spp.) pathogens in serum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and
      brain tissues of AD patients. We have used an in-house multiplex PCR kit for
      simultaneous detection of five bacterial and five viral pathogens in serum and
      CSF samples from 50 AD patients and 53 healthy controls (CTRL). We observed a
      significantly higher frequency rate of AD patients who tested positive for
      Treponema spp. compared to controls (AD: 62.2%; CTRL: 30.3%; p-value=0.007).
      Furthermore, we confirmed a significantly higher occurrence of cases with two or 
      more simultaneous infections in AD patients compared to controls (AD: 24%; CTRL
      7.5%; p-value=0.029). The studied pathogens were detected with comparable
      frequency in serum and CSF. In contrast, Borrelia burgdorferi, human herpesvirus 
      7, and human cytomegalovirus were not detected in any of the studied samples.
      This study provides further evidence of the association between microbial
      infections and AD and shows that paralleled analysis of multiple sample specimens
      provides complementary information and is advisable for future studies.

TI  - Repopulated microglia induce expression of Cxcl13 with differential changes in
      Tau phosphorylation but do not impact amyloid pathology.
PG  - 173
LID - 10.1186/s12974-022-02532-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adult microglia rely on self-renewal through division to repopulate
      and sustain their numbers. However, with aging, microglia display morphological
      and transcriptional changes that reflect a heightened state of neuroinflammation.
      This state threatens aging neurons and other cells and can influence the
      progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we sought to determine
      whether renewing microglia through a forced partial depletion/repopulation method
      could attenuate AD pathology in the 3xTg and APP/PS1 mouse models. METHODS: We
      pharmacologically depleted the microglia of two cohorts of 21- to 22-month-old
      3xTg mice and one cohort of 14-month-old APP/PS1 mice using PLX5622 formulated in
      chow for 2 weeks. Following depletion, we returned the mice to standard chow diet
      for 1 month to allow microglial repopulation. We assessed the effect of depletion
      and repopulation on AD pathology, microglial gene expression, and surface levels 
      of homeostatic markers on microglia using immunohistochemistry, single-cell
      RNAseq and flow cytometry. RESULTS: Although we did not identify a significant
      impact of microglial repopulation on amyloid pathology in either of the AD
      models, we observed differential changes in phosphorylated-Tau epitopes after
      repopulation in the 3xTg mice. We provide evidence that repopulated microglia in 
      the hippocampal formation exhibited changes in the levels of homeostatic
      microglial markers. Lastly, we identified novel subpopulations of microglia by
      performing single-cell RNAseq analysis on CD45(int/+) cells from hippocampi of
      control and repopulated 3xTg mice. In particular, one subpopulation induced after
      repopulation is characterized by heightened expression of Cxcl13. CONCLUSION:
      Overall, we found that depleting and repopulating microglia causes overexpression
      of microglial Cxcl13 with disparate effects on Tau and amyloid pathologies.

AB  - Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers play an important role in diagnosing
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) which is characterized by amyloid-beta (Abeta)
      amyloidosis. Here, we used two App knock-in mouse models, App(NL-F/NL-F) and
      App(NL-G-F/NL-G-F), exhibiting AD-like Abeta pathology to analyze how the brain
      pathologies translate to CSF proteomes by label-free mass spectrometry (MS). This
      identified several extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins as significantly altered
      in App knock-in mice. Next, we compared mouse CSF proteomes with previously
      reported human CSF MS results acquired from patients across the AD spectrum.
      Intriguingly, the ECM protein decorin was similarly and significantly increased
      in both App(NL-F/NL-F) and App(NL-G-F/NL-G-F) mice, strikingly already at three
      months of age in the App(NL-F/NL-F) mice and preclinical AD subjects having
      abnormal CSF-Abeta42 but normal cognition. Notably, in this group of subjects,
      CSF-decorin levels positively correlated with CSF-Abeta42 levels indicating that 
      the change in CSF-decorin is associated with early Abeta amyloidosis.
      Importantly, receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that CSF-decorin
      can predict a specific AD subtype having innate immune activation and potential
      choroid plexus dysfunction in the brain. Consistently, in App(NL-F/NL-F) mice,
      increased CSF-decorin correlated with both Abeta plaque load and with decorin
      levels in choroid plexus. In addition, a low concentration of human Abeta42
      induces decorin secretion from mouse primary neurons. Interestingly, we finally
      identify decorin to activate neuronal autophagy through enhancing lysosomal
      function. Altogether, the increased CSF-decorin levels occurring at an early
      stage of Abeta amyloidosis in the brain may reflect pathological changes in
      choroid plexus, present in a subtype of AD subjects.
