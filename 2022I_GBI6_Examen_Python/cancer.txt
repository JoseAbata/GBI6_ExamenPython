TI  - Pleural plaques and risk of lung cancer in workers formerly occupationally
      exposed to asbestos: extension of follow-up.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Occupational asbestos exposure is associated with pleural plaques
      (PP), a benign disease often seen as a marker of past exposure to asbestos and
      lung cancer. The association between these two diseases has not been formally
      proved, the aim of this study was to evaluate this association in the
      asbestos-related disease cohort (ARDCO) cohort. METHODS: ARDCO is a French
      multicentric cohort including workers formerly occupationally exposed to asbestos
      from 2003 to 2005. CT scan was performed to diagnose PP with double reading and
      lung cancer (incidence and mortality) was followed through health insurance data 
      and death certificates. Cox models were used to estimate the association between 
      PP and lung cancer adjusting for occupational asbestos exposure (represented by
      cumulative exposure index, time since first exposure and time since last
      exposure) and smoking status. RESULTS: A total of 176 cases (of 5050 subjects)
      and 88 deaths (of 4938 subjects) of lung cancer were recorded. Smoking status was
      identified as an effect modifier. Lung cancer incidence and mortality were
      significantly associated with PP only in non-smokers, respectively, HR=3.13 (95% 
      CI 1.04 to 9.35) and HR=16.83 (95% CI 1.87 to 151.24) after adjustment for age,
      occupational asbestos exposure and smoking status. CONCLUSIONS: ARDCO study was
      the first to study this association considering equal asbestos exposure, and more
      specifically, our study is the first to test smoking as an effect modifier, so
      comparison with scientific literature is difficult. Our results seem to
      consolidate the hypothesis that PP may be an independent risk factor for lung
      cancer but they must be interpreted with caution.

TI  - Distinct immune-effector and metabolic profile of CD8(+) T cells in patients with
      autoimmune polyarthritis induced by therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Rheumatic immune-related adverse events (irAE) such as
      (poly)arthritis in patients undergoing immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)
      treatment pose a major clinical challenge. ICI therapy improves CD8(+) T cell
      (CD8) function, but CD8 contributes to chronic inflammation in autoimmune
      arthritis (AA). Thus, we investigated whether immune functional and metabolic
      changes in CD8 explain the development of musculoskeletal irAE in ICI-treated
      patients. METHODS: Peripheral CD8 obtained from ICI-treated patients with and
      without arthritis irAEs and from AA patients with and without a history of
      malignancy were stimulated in media containing (13)C-labelled glucose with and
      without tofacitinib or infliximab. Changes in metabolism, immune-mediator
      release, expression of effector cell-surface molecules and inhibition of tumour
      cell growth were quantified. RESULTS: CD8 from patients with irAE showed
      significantly lower frequency and expression of cell-surface molecule
      characteristic for activation, effector-functions, homing, exhaustion and
      apoptosis and reduced release of cytotoxic and proinflammatory immune mediators
      compared with CD8 from ICI patients who did not develop irAE. This was
      accompanied by a higher glycolytic rate and ATP production. Gene-expression
      analysis of pre-ICI-treated CD8 revealed several differentially expressed
      transcripts in patients who later developed arthritis irAEs. In vitro tofacitinib
      or infliximab treatment did not significantly change the immune-metabolic profile
      nor the capacity to release cytolytic mediators that inhibit the growth of the
      human lung cancer cell line H838. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that CD8 from
      ICI-treated patients who develop a musculoskeletal irAE has a distinct
      immune-effector and metabolic profile from those that remain irAE free. This
      specific irAE profile overlaps with the one observed in CD8 from AA patients and 
      may prove useful for novel therapeutic strategies to manage ICI-induced irAEs.

TI  - Behcet's disease risk-variant HLA-B51/ERAP1-Hap10 alters human CD8 T cell
      immunity.
LID - annrheumdis-2022-222277 [pii]
LID - 10.1136/ard-2022-222277 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase (ERAP1) haplotype Hap10
      encodes for a variant allotype of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident
      peptide-trimming aminopeptidase ERAP1 with low enzymatic activity. This haplotype
      recessively confers the highest risk for Behcet's diseases (BD) currently known, 
      but only in carriers of HLA-B*51, the classical risk factor for the disease. The 
      mechanistic implications and biological consequences of this epistatic
      relationship are unknown. Here, we aimed to determine its biological relevance
      and functional impact. METHODS: We genotyped and immune phenotyped a cohort of 26
      untreated Turkish BD subjects and 22 healthy donors, generated CRISPR-Cas9 ERAP1 
      KOs from HLA-B*51 (+) LCL, analysed the HLA class I-bound peptidome for peptide
      length differences and assessed immunogenicity of genome-edited cells in CD8 T
      cell co-culture systems. RESULTS: Allele frequencies of ERAP1-Hap10 were similar 
      to previous studies. There were frequency shifts between antigen-experienced and 
      naive CD8 T cell populations of carriers and non-carriers of ERAP1-Hap10 in an
      HLA-B*51 background. ERAP1 KO cells showed peptidomes with longer peptides above 
      9mer and significant differences in their ability to stimulate alloreactive CD8 T
      cells compared with wild-type control cells. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that
      hypoactive ERAP1 changes immunogenicity to CD8 T cells, mediated by an HLA class 
      I peptidome with undertrimmed peptides. Naive/effector CD8 T cell shifts in
      affected carriers provide evidence of the biological relevance of
      ERAP1-Hap10/HLA-B*51 at the cellular level and point to an HLA-B51-restricted
      process. Our findings suggest that variant ERAP1-Hap10 partakes in BD
      pathogenesis by generating HLA-B51-restricted peptides, causing a change in
      immunodominance of the ensuing CD8 T cell response.

TI  - Evaluation of the 'Talking Together' simulation communication training for 'goals
      of patient care' conversations: a mixed-methods study in five metropolitan public
      hospitals in Western Australia.
PG  - e060226
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2021-060226 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In partnership with Cancer Council Western Australia (WA), the East
      Metropolitan Health Service in Perth, WA has developed a clinical simulation
      training programme 'Talking Together' using role play scenarios with trained
      actors as patients/carers. The aim of the training is to improve clinicians'
      communication skills when having challenging conversations with patients, or
      their carers, in relation to goals of care in the event of clinical
      deterioration. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A multisite, longitudinal mixed-methods
      study will be conducted to evaluate the impact of the communication skills
      training programme on patient, family/carer and clinician outcomes. Methods
      include online surveys and interviews. The study will assess outcomes in three
      areas: evaluation of the 'Talking Together' workshops and their effect on
      satisfaction, confidence and integration of best practice communication skills;
      quality of goals of patient care conversations from the point of view of
      clinicians, carers and family/carers; and investigation of the nursing/allied
      role in goals of patient care. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has received 
      ethical approval from the Royal Perth Hospital, St John of God and Curtin
      University Human Research Ethics Committees. The outputs from this project will
      be a series of research papers and conference presentations.

TI  - Online information in Spanish on probiotics, yoghurt, kefir, kombucha, fibre and 
      prebiotics: an analysis of the quality of information and the certainty of the
      evidence supporting health claims.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the certainty of the evidence supporting health claims
      about probiotics, yoghurt, kefir, kombucha, fibre and prebiotics, and to assess
      the quality of online information in Spanish. DESIGN: Content analysis. METHODS: 
      We compiled a data set of 114 web pages by searching six popular search phrases
      in Spanish relating to probiotics, yoghurt, kefir, kombucha, fibre and prebiotics
      on Google.es and coded them for typology and health claims. We examined the
      certainty of the evidence for health claims from systematic reviews. Information 
      quality was assessed according to 10 criteria, where a web page: mentions
      scientific publications and reports their conclusions; quantifies relative and
      absolute effects; acknowledges some limitations; discusses certainty of evidence;
      reports the potential harms, alternatives and costs; and does not argue based on 
      personal experiences. RESULTS: Gastrointestinal health (86.0%), general health
      (57.9%), cardiovascular health (53.5%) and immune system health (50.9%) were the 
      most widely mentioned topics. Half of claims (52.6%, 70/133) were supported by
      evidence from systematic reviews. Probiotics had the highest number of claims
      supported by evidence and kombucha the lowest. The highest certainty was found
      for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, necrotising enterocolitis and otitis
      (moderate) in probiotics and yoghurt, infectious diarrhoea and hepatic
      encephalopathy (moderate) in prebiotics, and cardiovascular health (high to
      moderate) and colorectal cancer (moderate) in fibre. On a scale of 0-10, the
      median information quality score for all web pages was 3. Only 18.4% reported
      study conclusions, 7.9% quantified the effects, 28.9% acknowledged some
      limitations in the research and 42.1% reported potential harms. CONCLUSIONS: Most
      online health claims for dietary interventions intended for improving health
      through the gut microbiome are supported by low or very low certainty of
      evidence. Online information does not align with the evidence and is incomplete
      or unbalanced.

TI  - DNA Methylation Analysis to predict Regression of high-grade anal Intraepithelial
      Neoplasia in HIV+ men (MARINE): a cohort study protocol.
PG  - e060301
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2021-060301 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Anal cancer precursors, or high-grade anal intraepithelial
      neoplasia (HGAIN), are highly prevalent in HIV-seropositive (HIV+) men who have
      sex with men (MSM). Around 30% of lesions regress within 1 year, but current
      histopathological assessment is unable to distinguish between HGAIN likely to
      regress and HGAIN likely to persist or progress to cancer. We aim to assess if
      host cell DNA methylation markers can predict regression of HGAIN, thus
      determining the need for immediate treatment or active surveillance. This could
      reduce overtreatment and the associated anal and psycho-sexual morbidity. METHODS
      AND ANALYSIS: This is an active surveillance cohort study in three centres
      located in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, in 200 HIV+ MSM diagnosed with HGAIN.
      Participants will not be treated, but closely monitored during 24 months of
      follow-up with 6 monthly visits including cytology, and high-resolution anoscopy 
      with biopsies. The primary study endpoint is histopathological regression of each
      baseline HGAIN lesion at the end of the study. Regression is defined as </=low
      grade anal intraepithelial neoplasia in the exit biopsy at 24 months. Regression 
      proportions in lesions with low versus high methylation levels (ASCL1, ZNF582),
      other biomarkers (HPV genotype, HPV-E4, p16(INK4A), Ki-67) and immunological
      markers at baseline will be compared. Main secondary endpoints are the
      histological and clinical outcome (ie, the number of octants affected by HGAIN)
      of each baseline HGAIN lesion and overall HGAIN disease (i.e., all lesions
      combined) after each visit. The health-related quality of life of the study group
      will be compared with that of a control group of 50 HIV+ MSM receiving regular
      HGAIN treatment. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval was obtained from the 
      Institutional Review Board of the Academic Medical Center (Amsterdam, The
      Netherlands; reference no. 2021_099). Participants are required to provide
      written informed consent. Findings will be disseminated through publication in
      peer-reviewed scientific journals and presentations at international scientific
      conferences; dissemination to policy makers and the target patient group will be 
      achieved through our (inter-)national network, professional associations and
      collaboration with a patient representative organisation. TRIAL REGISTRATION

TI  - Online randomised factorial trial of electronic Screening and Brief Intervention 
      for alcohol use in pregnancy: a study protocol.
PG  - e062735
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2022-062735 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Approximately 1 in 7 pregnant women in the USA report past-month
      alcohol use. Strong evidence connects prenatal alcohol exposure with a range of
      adverse perinatal outcomes, including the spectrum of conditions known as fetal
      alcohol spectrum disorders. Screening and Brief Intervention (SBI) has been
      recommended for pregnant women but has proven difficult to implement. This study 
      will test the efficacy of single-session technology-delivered SBI (electronic
      SBI) for alcohol use in pregnancy, while simultaneously evaluating the possible
      additional benefit of tailored text messages and/or booster sessions in a 3x2
      factorial trial. METHOD AND ANALYSIS: This full factorial trial will use online
      advertising and clinic-based flyers to recruit pregnant women meeting criteria
      for unhealthy alcohol use, and randomly assign them to one of six conditions
      crossing three levels of brief intervention (none, single 120-minute session and 
      single session plus two 5-minute boosters) with two levels of tailored text
      messaging (none vs twice weekly messages). The primary analysis will test for
      dose-response effects of the brief intervention on alcohol abstinence, defined as
      no self-report of alcohol use in the 90 days prior to 34 weeks' gestation, and
      negative results for ethyl glucuronide analysis of fingernail samples. Secondary 
      analyses will examine main and interaction effects of tailored text messaging as 
      well as intervention effects on birth outcomes. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical
      approval was provided by the Michigan State University Biomedical and Health
      Institutional Review Board (STUDY00005298). Results will be presented at
      conferences and community forums, in addition to being published in a
      peer-reviewed journal. Intervention content demonstrating sufficient efficacy and
      safety will be made publicly available. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER:
      ClinicalTrials.gov Registry (NCT04332172).

      review.
PG  - e052053
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2021-052053 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Studies, mainly from high-income countries, suggest that there are
      ethnic and racial variations in prevalence of uterine fibroids (UF). However,
      there have been few studies of the epidemiology of UF in sub-Saharan Africa
      (SSA). We reviewed published articles on the epidemiology of UF in SSA. DESIGN:
      This was a scoping review of literature. SETTINGS: We searched three databases
      (PubMed, African Wide Information (EBSCO) and African Journals OnLine (AJOL)).
      The search for eligible articles was conducted between December 2019 and January 
      2021. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: To describe the reported
      prevalence/incidence of, and risk factors for UF in SSA. RESULTS: Of the 1052
      articles retrieved, 9 met the inclusion criteria for review. The articles were
      from Nigeria (4/9), Ghana (2/9), Cameroon (1/9), Kenya (1/9) and South Africa
      (1/9). Two studies from pathology departments and three studies from radiology
      departments reported prevalence of UF. We did not find any study on the incidence
      or genomics of UF in SSA. Of the three studies that reported on the risk factors 
      of UF, only one case-control study that was conducted using retrospective data of
      attendees at a gynaecological clinic conducted multivariable analysis.
      CONCLUSION: There is lack of robust epidemiological studies of the prevalence,
      incidence and risk factors of UF in SSA. There is urgent need to study
      epidemiological and genomics risk factors of UF in SSA because UF is the most
      common gynaecological neoplasm in this population where it is associated with
      significant morbidity and occasional, usually perioperative, mortality.

LID - e100588 [pii]
LID - 10.1136/bmjhci-2022-100588 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the impact on efficiency and quality of
      preprostatectomy multidisciplinary therapy conferences (MDT) at Karolinska
      University Hospital related to the use of a digital solution compared with
      standard of care. Further, to explore whether gains in MDT efficiency and quality
      impact oncological or functional patient outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a
      prospective, observational study of preoperative prostate cancer MDT at
      Karolinska between February 2017 and March 2021, including 1329 patients. We
      compared efficiency and quality of the standard MDT and the MDT using the digital
      solution IntelliSpace Precision Medicine Multidisciplinary Team Orchestrator
      (ISPM) based on the previously used MDT-MODe approach. Clinical and
      patient-reported functional outcomes were derived from the medical records and
      the Swedish National Prostate Cancer Register. RESULTS: While ISPM was used
      during the MDT meeting, the time spent per patient was reduced by 24% (p<0.001)
      and most of the MDT-MODe items were scored significantly higher. There was a
      reduction in pelvic lymph-node dissection procedures in the ISPM cohort (p=0.001)
      and an increased proportion of unilateral nerve-sparing procedures (p=0.005),
      while all other outcome-related measures were not significantly different between
      the two patient groups. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: To increase the value of the
      MDT, all data relevant for treatment decision need to be purposefully presented
      and compiled, which also enables secondary use of the data.The use of a digital
      solution during preoperative MDTs for prostate cancer decision making at
      Karolinska University Hospital improved the efficiency and quality of this
      multidisciplinary team meeting without impacting patient outcomes.

AB  - The advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors has reinvigorated the field of
      immuno-oncology. These monoclonal antibody-based therapies allow the immune
      system to recognize and eliminate malignant cells. This has resulted in improved 
      survival of patients across several tumor types. However, not all patients
      respond to immunotherapy therefore predictive biomarkers are important. There are
      only a few Food and Drug Administration-approved biomarkers to select patients
      for immunotherapy. These biomarkers do not consider the heterogeneity of tumor
      characteristics across lesions within a patient. New molecular imaging tracers
      allow for whole-body visualization with positron emission tomography (PET) of
      tumor and immune cell characteristics, and drug distribution, which might guide
      treatment decision making. Here, we summarize recent developments in molecular
      imaging of immune checkpoint molecules, such as PD-L1, PD-1, CTLA-4, and LAG-3.
      We discuss several molecular imaging approaches of immune cell subsets and
      briefly summarize the role of FDG-PET for evaluating cancer immunotherapy. The
      main focus is on developments in clinical molecular imaging studies, next to
      preclinical studies of interest given their potential translation to the clinic.

TI  - Role of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination on HPV infection and recurrence of
      HPV related disease after local surgical treatment: systematic review and
      meta-analysis.
PG  - e070135
LID - 10.1136/bmj-2022-070135 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the efficacy of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination on
      the risk of HPV infection and recurrent diseases related to HPV infection in
      individuals undergoing local surgical treatment. DESIGN: Systematic review and
      meta-analysis DATA SOURCES: PubMed (Medline), Scopus, Cochrane, Web of Science,
      and ClinicalTrials.gov were screened from inception to 31 March 2021. REVIEW
      METHODS: Studies reporting on the risk of HPV infection and recurrence of disease
      related to HPV infection after local surgical treatment of preinvasive genital
      disease in individuals who were vaccinated were included. The primary outcome
      measure was risk of recurrence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or
      higher (CIN2+) after local surgical treatment, with follow-up as reported by
      individual studies. Secondary outcome measures were risk of HPV infection or
      other lesions related to HPV infection. Independent and in duplicate data
      extraction and quality assessment were performed with ROBINS-I and RoB-2 tools
      for observational studies and randomised controlled trials, respectively. Grading
      of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) was
      implemented for the primary outcome. Observational studies and randomised
      controlled trials were analysed separately from post hoc analyses of randomised
      controlled trials. Pooled risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals were
      calculated with a random effects meta-analysis model. The restricted maximum
      likelihood was used as an estimator for heterogeneity, and the
      Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman method was used to derive confidence intervals.
      RESULTS: 22 articles met the inclusion criteria of the review; 18 of these
      studies also reported data from a non-vaccinated group and were included in the
      meta-analyses (12 observational studies, two randomised controlled trials, and
      four post hoc analyses of randomised controlled trials). The risk of recurrence
      of CIN2+ was reduced in individuals who were vaccinated compared with those who
      were not vaccinated (11 studies, 19 909 participants; risk ratio 0.43, 95%
      confidence interval 0.30 to 0.60; I(2)=58%, tau(2)=0.14, median follow-up 36
      months, interquartile range 24-43.5). The effect estimate was even stronger when 
      the risk of recurrence of CIN2+ was assessed for disease related to HPV subtypes 
      HPV16 or HPV18 (six studies, 1879 participants; risk ratio 0.26, 95% confidence
      interval 0.16 to 0.43; I(2)=0%, tau(2)=0). Confidence in the meta-analysis for
      CIN2+ overall and CIN2+ related to HPV16 or HPV18, assessed by GRADE, ranged from
      very low to moderate, probably because of publication bias and inconsistency in
      the studies included in the meta-analysis. The risk of recurrence of CIN3 was
      also reduced in patients who were vaccinated but uncertainty was large (three
      studies, 17 757 participants; 0.28, 0.01 to 6.37; I(2)=71%, tau(2)=1.23).
      Evidence of benefit was lacking for recurrence of vulvar, vaginal, and anal
      intraepithelial neoplasia, genital warts, and persistent and incident HPV
      infections, although the number of studies and participants in each outcome was
      low. CONCLUSION: HPV vaccination might reduce the risk of recurrence of CIN, in
      particular when related to HPV16 or HPV18, in women treated with local excision. 
      GRADE assessment for the quality of evidence indicated that the data were
      inconclusive. Large scale, high quality randomised controlled trials are required
      to establish the level of effectiveness and cost of HPV vaccination in women
      undergoing treatment for diseases related to HPV infection. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW

      countries: Different practices of assessment and management.
LID - 10.1111/bjh.18397 [doi]
AB  - Patients undergoing treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) are at risk
      of coagulopathy, especially thromboembolism. We conducted a survey on practices
      in the assessment and management of coagulopathy during the new ALLTogether
      protocol in 29 (17 paediatric, 12 adult) Nordic and Baltic cancer centres. While 
      92% of adult centres used thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin,
      no paediatric centre did. Almost all providers performed baseline coagulation
      studies, but only 59% continued the assessment. Fibrinogen replacement was
      conducted in 59%, and antithrombin replacement in 28% of the centres. The survey 
      highlights the need for guidelines in the management of coagulopathy during ALL
      therapy.

TI  - The Low Rate of Adherence to Checklist for Artificial Intelligence in Medical

LID - 10.1016/j.jacr.2022.05.022 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the rigor, generalizability, and reproducibility of
      published classification and detection artificial intelligence (AI) models for
      prostate cancer (PCa) on MRI using the Checklist for Artificial Intelligence in
      Medical Imaging (CLAIM) guidelines, a 42-item checklist that is considered a
      measure of best practice for presenting and reviewing medical imaging AI
      research. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This review searched English literature for
      studies proposing PCa AI detection and classification models on MRI. Each study
      was evaluated with the CLAIM checklist. The additional outcomes for which data
      were sought included measures of AI model performance (eg, area under the curve
      [AUC], sensitivity, specificity, free-response operating characteristic curves), 
      training and validation and testing group sample size, AI approach, detection
      versus classification AI, public data set utilization, MRI sequences used, and
      definition of gold standard for ground truth. The percentage of CLAIM checklist
      fulfillment was used to stratify studies into quartiles. Wilcoxon's rank-sum test
      was used for pair-wise comparisons. RESULTS: In all, 75 studies were identified, 
      and 53 studies qualified for analysis. The original CLAIM items that most studies
      did not fulfill includes item 12 (77% no): de-identification methods; item 13
      (68% no): handling missing data; item 15 (47% no): rationale for choosing ground 
      truth reference standard; item 18 (55% no): measurements of inter- and
      intrareader variability; item 31 (60% no): inclusion of validated
      interpretability maps; item 37 (92% no): inclusion of failure analysis to
      elucidate AI model weaknesses. An AUC score versus percentage CLAIM fulfillment
      quartile revealed a significant difference of the mean AUC scores between
      quartile 1 versus quartile 2 (0.78 versus 0.86, P = .034) and quartile 1 versus
      quartile 4 (0.78 versus 0.89, P = .003) scores. Based on additional information
      and outcome metrics gathered in this study, additional measures of best practice 
      are defined. These new items include disclosure of public dataset usage, ground
      truth definition in comparison to other referenced works in the defined task, and
      sample size power calculation. CONCLUSION: A large proportion of AI studies do
      not fulfill key items in CLAIM guidelines within their methods and results
      sections. The percentage of CLAIM checklist fulfillment is weakly associated with
      improved AI model performance. Additions or supplementations to CLAIM are

TI  - Surgical outcomes and sexual function after laparoscopic colon cancer surgery
      with transvaginal versus conventional specimen extraction: A retrospective
      propensity score matched cohort study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Natural orifice specimen extraction has been shown to reduce
      postoperative pain and wound complications, and provide better cosmetic outcome. 
      However, whether transvaginal specimen extraction affects sexual function remains
      controversial. The purpose of this study was to investigate the short-term
      outcome, sexual function, cosmetic outcomes and prognosis after colon cancer
      surgery with transvaginal specimen extraction. METHOD: This study was a
      propensity score-matched comparative retrospective study, based on prospectively 
      collected data in a single center. This study included 70 pairs of propensity
      score-matched female patients who underwent laparoscopic curative resection for
      stage I-III colon cancer with transvaginal specimen extraction and conventional
      specimen extraction between November 2015 and November 2020. Covariates used in
      the propensity score included age, tumor diameter, tumor differentiation, T stage
      and American Joint Committee on Cancer stage. Outcome measures included
      postoperative complication, postoperative sexual function, cosmetic result,
      disease-free survival and overall survival. RESULTS: Patients in transvaginal
      group were administered with less additional analgesics (P=0.008), and had fewer 
      wound complications (P=0.028). None of patient in the two groups underwent
      anastomotic leakage, incisional disruption or vaginal fistula. The baseline
      pre-operative Female Sexual Function Index scores in two groups were the same,
      and no difference was found in postoperative score between the two groups
      (P=0.790). The cosmetic score was significantly better in transvaginal group than
      that of conventional laparoscopy group (P=0.000). During the follow-up period,
      there were no differences in OS or DFS between the two groups (P=0.658, P=0.663).
      CONCLUSIONS: Compared with laparoscopic colon cancer radical resection with
      specimen extraction, transvaginal specimen extraction is oncologically safe,
      brings better short-term outcomes, improved cosmetic results and has limited
      adverse effect on female's sexual function. This procedure can be further carried
      out in more appropriate patients.

AB  - Radiotherapy is a standard-of-care treatment approach for glioblastoma (GBM)
      patients, but therapeutic resistance to radiotherapy remains a major challenge.
      Here we demonstrate that diallyl trisulfide (DATS) directly conjugates with
      cysteine (C) 32 and C35 (C32/35) residues of thioredoxin 1 (Trx1) through Michael
      addition reactions. Due to localizing in activity center of Trx1, the conjugation
      between DATS and C32/35 results in inhibition of Trx1 activity, therefore
      disturbing thioredoxin system and leading to accumulated levels of reactive
      oxygen species (ROS). High levels of Trx1 expression are correlated with poor
      prognosis of glioma patients. Notably, we reveal that DATS synergistically
      enhances irradiation (IR)-induced ROS accumulation, apoptosis, DNA damage, as
      well as inhibition of tumor growth of GBM cells. These findings highlight the
      potential benefits of DATS in sensitizing radiotherapy of GBM patients.

AB  - Both innate and adaptive immune systems play a crucial role in the pathology of
      skin diseases. To control these cells, there is a need for transdermal drug
      delivery systems that can target multiple cell populations at independently
      tunable rates. Herein, we describe a tissue-adhesive hydrogel system that
      contains particles capable of regulating the release of small molecule drugs at
      defined rates. Resiquimod (a macrophage-targeting drug) and palbociclib (a T
      cell-targeting drug) are encapsulated within two types of silicone particles
      embedded within the hydrogels. We demonstrate that drug release is mediated by
      the crosslink density of the particles, which is decoupled from the bulk
      properties of the hydrogel. We show that this system can be used to sustainably
      polarize macrophages toward an anti-tumor phenotype in vitro and ex vivo, and
      that the hydrogels can remain attached to skin explants for several days without 
      generating toxicity. The hydrogel is compatible with standard dermatological
      procedures and allows transdermal passage of drugs. The multimodal, tunable
      nature of this system has implications in treating a variety of skin disorders,
      managing infections, and delivering vaccines. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: :We
      describe a tissue-adhesive hydrogel that can regulate the release of drugs in a
      manner that is decoupled from its bulk properties. The mechanism of drug release 
      is mediated by embedded microparticles with well-defined crosslink densities. The
      significance of this system is that, by encapsulating different drugs into the
      particles, it is possible to achieve multimodal drug release. We demonstrate this
      capability by releasing two immunomodulatory drugs at disparate rates. A drug
      that targets innate immune cells is released quickly, and a drug that targets
      adaptive immune cells is released slowly. This programmable system offers a
      direct means by which cellular responses can be enhanced through independent
      targeting for a variety of transdermal applications, including cancer treatment
      and vaccine delivery.

TI  - Favorable Outcome with Conditioning Regimen of Flu/Bu4/Mel in Acute Myeloid
      Leukemia Patients in Remission Undergoing Cord Blood Transplantation.
LID - S2666-6367(22)01513-5 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jtct.2022.07.026 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cord blood transplantation (CBT) is a curative therapeutic option for
      patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who do not have human leukocyte
      antigen-matched donors. The decline in early non-relapse mortality (NRM) after
      CBT has significantly improved overall survival (OS) during the past 20 years
      because of advances in CBT practices, such as more careful patient selection, use
      of safer conditioning regimens, better unit selection of cord blood, and
      improvement in supportive care. A previous study reported a conditioning regimen 
      comprising fludarabine, busulfan, and melphalan (Flu/Bu4/Mel) developed for
      patients undergoing CBT in non-complete remission (CR) myeloid malignancies,
      which showed durable engraftment and remission with acceptable non-relapse
      mortality (NRM), leading to excellent survival outcomes. However, no prior study 
      has focused on the role of Flu/Bu4/Mel in CBT conditioning and compared it with
      conventional myeloablative conditioning (MAC) for AML patients in CR. OBJECTIVES:
      We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of Flu/Bu4/Mel compared to
      cyclophosphamide and total-body irradiation (CY/TBI)-based MAC for AML patients
      in CR who underwent CBT. STUDY DESIGN: Patients were selected from the Japanese
      nationwide transplantation registry according to the following inclusion
      criteria: (1) patients with AML aged >/=16 years; (2) first transplantation of
      single-unit cord blood; (3) CR at the time of transplantation. RESULTS: Of 477
      eligible patients, 148 (31.0%) received CY/TBI, 223 (46.8%) received HDCA/CY/TBI,
      and 106 (22.2%) received Flu/Bu4/Mel. The probabilities of OS in the CY/TBI,
      HDCA/CY/TBI, and Flu/Bu4/Mel groups were 64.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]:
      56.0%-72.3%), 65.1% (95% CI: 57.8%-71.4%), and 65.5% (95% CI: 53.7%-74.9%) at 3
      years, respectively (P=0.71). The cumulative incidences of relapse in the CY/TBI,
      HDCA/CY/TBI, and Flu/Bu4/Mel groups were 22.0% (95% CI: 15.2%-29.5%), 17.2% (95% 
      CI: 12.2%-22.9%), and 18.0% (95% CI: 11.2%-26.2%) at 3 years, respectively
      (P=0.40). The cumulative incidences of NRM in the CY/TBI, HDCA/CY/TBI, and
      Flu/Bu4/Mel groups were 17.2% (95% CI: 11.5%-24.0%), 20.7% (95% CI: 15.4%-26.7%),
      and 18.6% (95% CI: 11.4%-27.2%) at 3 years, respectively (P=0.95). Multivariate
      analysis revealed that Flu/Bu4/Mel was a favorable factor for OS; however, it was
      not significantly favorable for relapse and NRM among the CY/TBI, HDCA/CY/TBI,
      and Flu/Bu4/Mel groups (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.50 [95% CI, 0.29-0.88]; P=0.015, HR:
      0.67 [95% CI, 0.31-1.46]; P=0.31, and HR: 0.55 [95% CI, 0.26-1.18]; P=0.12,
      respectively). Flu/Bu4/Mel was a favorable factor for neutrophil engraftment
      (1.51 [95% CI, 1.08-2.12]; P=0.016). CONCLUSION: The multivariate analysis showed
      that Flu/Bu4/Mel had a favorable prognostic impact on OS and neutrophil
      engraftment despite the non-TBI regimen. Our findings suggest that Flu/Bu4/Mel
      may sustain antileukemia effect with decreasing NRM and it could be a favorable
      CBT conditioning regimen for patients with AML in CR.

AB  - With the development of epigenetic engineering tools for manipulating DNA
      methylation at the desired locus, the stable maintenance of targeted methylation 
      status in edited cells after division poses a major obstacle. Transient
      methylation levels, along with the reversible inhibition of the desired genes, by
      some epigenetic editing techniques, limit their further application in functional
      and therapeutic studies of critical regulators in the cancer epigenome. In this
      study, we utilized CRISPR/Cas9-mediated the homology-directed repair (HDR)
      pathway following double-strand breaks (DSBs) information to target de novo
      methylation of the vital epigenetic biomarker, O(6)-methylguanine-DNA
      methyltransferase (MGMT). Based on synthetic single and double stranded
      methylated repair templates, DNA methylation patterns can be incorporated into
      the endogenous MGMT gene. In addition, we observed upregulation of DNA
      methyltransferases (DNMTs) in edited HeLa cells. In particular, we employed an
      optimized method of using the DNA ligase IV inhibitor SCR7 to markedly enhance
      the insertion efficiency induced by the long methylated repair template,
      contributing to the induction of stable methylation alterations through
      epigenetic recombination after cell division. Additionally, our study confirmed
      that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated target methylation in a site-specific manner enabled
      the maintenance of gene silencing in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, we show
      that a combination of CRISPR/Cas9 components, SCR7 treatment, and the long
      methylated HDR template can enhance CRISPR/Cas9-directed epigenomic editing
      efficiency and further induce stable effects on methylation modifications and
      transcriptional suppression.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Tirzepatide, a dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist,
      delivered superior glycemic control and weight loss compared to selective GLP-1
      receptor (GLP-1R) agonism in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). These results
      have fueled mechanistic studies focused on understanding how tirzepatide achieves
      its therapeutic efficacy. Recently, we found that treatment with tirzepatide
      improves insulin sensitivity in humans with T2D and obese mice in concert with a 
      reduction in circulating levels of branched-chain amino (BCAAs) and keto (BCKAs) 
      acids, metabolites associated with development of systemic insulin resistance
      (IR) and T2D. Importantly, these systemic effects were found to be coupled to
      increased expression of BCAA catabolic genes in thermogenic brown adipose tissue 
      (BAT) in mice. These findings led us to hypothesize that tirzepatide may lower
      circulating BCAAs/BCKAs by promoting their catabolism in BAT. METHODS: To address
      this question, we utilized a murine model of diet-induced obesity and employed
      stable-isotope tracer studies in combination with metabolomic analyses in BAT and
      other tissues. RESULTS: Treatment with tirzepatide stimulated catabolism of
      BCAAs/BCKAs in BAT, as demonstrated by increased labeling of BCKA-derived
      metabolites, and increases in levels of byproducts of BCAA breakdown, including
      glutamate, alanine, and 3-hydroxyisobutyric acid (3-HIB). Further, chronic
      administration of tirzepatide increased levels of multiple amino acids in BAT
      that have previously been shown to be elevated in response to cold exposure.
      Finally, chronic treatment with tirzepatide led to a substantial increase in
      several TCA cycle intermediates (alpha-ketoglutarate, fumarate, and malate) in
      BAT. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that tirzepatide induces a
      thermogenic-like amino acid profile in BAT, an effect that may account for
      reduced systemic levels of BCAAs in obese IR mice.

AB  - Hematopoiesis and the immune system beyond the tumor microenvironment are
      typically dysregulated in cancer. Tumor-derived small extracellular vesicles
      (sEVs) containing exosomes are emerging contributors to tumor progression and
      immunomodulation. However, a comprehensive definition of how tumor-derived sEVs
      impacts systemic immunity is lacking. In this study, we used mass cytometry with 
      extensive antibody panels to determine the expression of 24 immune cell markers, 
      eight intracellular proteins, and seven immune checkpoint proteins in systemic
      immune cell lineages. The systemic immune landscape in response to tumor-derived 
      sEVs across three immune organs in a melanoma mouse model was then characterized.
      Melanoma-derived sEVs significantly and extensively influenced the composition
      and intracellular pathways of immune lineage and T cells. An immunosuppressive
      immune system with decreased natural killer and CD8 T cells in the spleen and
      bone marrow (BM), increased regulatory T cells in lymph nodes, and increased
      polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSC) in the BM, was
      induced by melanoma-derived sEVs. Additionally, melanoma-derived sEVs
      significantly enhanced the PD-1/PD-L1 axis in CD4 T cells and myeloid cell
      subsets. These sEVs largely promoted the proliferation of multiple hematopoietic 
      stem and progenitor cell subsets and accelerated their differentiation towards
      MDSCs in naive mice and mice undergoing hematopoietic reconstruction. Moreover,
      melanoma-derived sEVs directly promoted the survival and activation of MDSCs in
      vitro. Collectively, our work examines the effects of tumor-derived sEVs on the
      systemic onco-immune macroenvironments and highlights the contribution of these
      sEVs to the dysregulation of hematopoiesis and systemic immune landscape in
      cancer.

AB  - Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark in multiple types of malignancies.
      Fast-growing cancer cells require facilitated synthesis of essential metabolites 
      and excessive energy production. However, whether they are internally coordinated
      remains largely unknown. Herein, we found that de novo pyrimidine synthesis
      enhanced aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells. Mechanistically, pyrimidine
      biosynthesis augmented Notch signaling and transcriptionally increased c-Myc
      expression, leading to up-regulation of critical glycolytic enzymes. Further
      studies revealed that pyrimidine synthesis could stabilize gamma-secretase
      subunit Nicastrin at post-translational N-linked glycosylation level, thereby
      inducing the cleavage and activation of Notch. Besides, we found that
      up-regulation of the key enzymes for de novo pyrimidine synthesis CAD and DHODH
      conferred the chemotherapeutic resistance of gastric cancer via accelerating
      glycolysis, and pharmacologic inhibition of pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway
      sensitized cancer cells to chemotherapy in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, our
      findings provide more insights into the regulation of aerobic glycolysis and a
      metabolic vulnerability that can be exploited to enhance chemotherapy efficacy in
      gastric cancer.

AB  - Inflammation, which triggers the release of a variety of growth factors,
      cytokines, and chemokines, is a critical component of tumor progression.
      Prokineticin 2 belongs to a new family of chemokines bound to two
      G-protein-coupled receptors called prokineticin receptor 1 and 2 that exert
      various tissue-specific biological functions. Under pathological conditions,
      prokineticin 2 can induce the proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis of
      endothelial cells, suggesting that this molecule plays a role in tumor growth,
      angiogenesis, and metastasis. The aim of this review is to provide a complete
      compendium of the involvement of prokineticin 2 in some cancers and to evaluate
      its role not only in the tumor microenvironment as an angiogenic factor and a
      mediator of immune cell migration, but also in modulating tumor growth and spread
      as a suppressor of tumor cell apoptosis, and as a trigger of their proliferation 
      and movements required for metastasis. The involvement of prokineticin 2 in tumor
      pain and resistance responses is also described, and finally, the potential role 
      of prokineticin 2 as a novel prognostic tumor biomarker is highlighted.

AB  - Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a group of malignant heterogeneous cancer arising
      from the biliary tree. CCA has become a global health problem with rising
      incidence and mortality that threatens the health of human beings. The immune
      microenvironment of CCA is characterized by abundant cancer-associated fibroblast
      and suppressive immune components. The increasing body of knowledge and recent
      developments in transcriptomic studies have given insight into the immune
      landscape of CCA, paving the way for better application of immunotherapy.
      Immunotherapy mainly applies in a limited subset of CCA with deficient mismatch
      and high microsatellite instability. With limited response rates and treatment
      efficacy, researchers are looking into novel strategies on combination strategies
      and alternatives, such as immune vaccines and adoptive cell therapy. Biomarker
      identification is also critical for patient selection. We present an up-to-date
      summary of the current research on immunotherapy for CCA patients, covering
      pre-clinical and clinical exploration beyond immune checkpoint inhibitors, immune
      vaccines, and adoptive cell therapy. In addition, we review the promising
      biomarkers for CCA immunotherapy and discuss recent development.

AB  - Paclitaxel (PTX) is a widely used chemotherapeutic drug particularly effective
      against lung, breast, and ovarian cancer, though its usefulness is limited due to
      its multi-organ toxicity. The mechanisms underlying PTX toxicity are currently
      not yet known and there are no approved treatments for its control or prevention.
      This study aimed to investigate whether hesperidin (HSP) had a protective effect 
      on paclitaxel-induced hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity from biochemical, and
      molecular perspectives. The rats were administered PTX 2mg/kg, b.w.
      intraperitoneally for the first 5 consecutive days, then 100 or 200mg/kg b.w. HSP
      orally for 10 consecutive days. Our results demonstrated that HSP decreased the
      PTX induced lipid peroxidation, improved the serum hepatic and renal functions
      (by decreasing the levels of AST, ALT, ALP, urea, and creatinine), and restored
      the liver and kidney antioxidant armory (SOD, CAT, GPx, and GSH). HSP also
      significantly reduced mRNA expression levels of NF-kappaB, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta,
      IL-6, MAPK 14, Caspase-3, Bax, LC3A, LC3B, MMP2, and MMP9 whereas caused an
      increase in levels of Nrf2, HO-1, and Bcl-2 in the kidney and liver of
      PTX-induced rats. In addition, caspase-3, Bax, and Bcl-2 protein levels were
      examined by western blot analysis, and it was determined that HSP decreased
      caspase-3 and Bax protein levels, but increased Bcl-2 protein levels. The
      findings of the study suggest that HSP has chemopreventive potential against
      PTX-induced hepatorenal toxicity plausibly through the attenuation of oxidative
      stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and autophagy.

AB  - A series of seleno-biotin analogs were synthesized and their anticancer activity 
      and mode of action were assessed using ovarian cancer cells. Compound 2, out of
      the other analogs, in direct comparison to biotin alone, more effectively reduced
      the cell viability and induced apoptosis in ovarian cancer cell lines in a dose
      dependent manner as demonstrated by the cell viability assay, trypan blue dye
      exclusion assay, Annexin V/7-AAD, and Caspase 3/7 apoptosis assays. Furthermore, 
      compound 2 showed efficacy better than 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and similar to
      cisplatin, in vitro; notably it was more cytotoxic to drug-resistant Hey A8 cells
      than cisplatin. The cytotoxicity of compound 2 was primarily mediated by reactive
      oxygen species (ROS) as demonstrated by DCFDA based ROS estimation. Biotin
      receptors (BR) saturation and the use of a BR negative cell line showed a
      significant decline in the cytotoxic ativity of the compound 2, confirming that
      its activity is BR-mediated. These experiments demonstrated that selenium
      modified biotin which contains an ester linked redox cycling selenocyanate group 
      has the potential for human therapeutic applications against ovarian and other
      cancers over-expressing BR.

AB  - Cancer cells adapt their intracellular energy metabolism to the oxygen-deprived
      tumor microenvironment (TME) to ensure tumor progression. This adaptive mechanism
      has focused attention on the metabolic phenotypes of tumor cells under hypoxic
      TME for developing novel cancer therapies. Although widely used monolayer (2D)
      culture does not fully reflect in vivo hypoxic TME, spheroid (3D) culture can
      produce a milieu similar to the TME in vivo. However, how different metabolic
      phenotypes are expressed in 3D cultures mimicking tumor hypoxia compared with 2D 
      cultures under hypoxia remains unclear. To address this issue, we investigated
      the metabolic phenotypes of 2D- and 3D-cultured cancer cells by (13)C-metabolic
      flux analysis ((13)C-MFA). Principal component analysis of (13)C mass isotopomer 
      distributions clearly demonstrated distinct metabolic phenotypes of 3D-cultured
      cells. (13)C-MFA clarified that 3D culture significantly upregulated pyruvate
      carboxylase flux in line with the pyruvate carboxylase protein expression level. 
      On the other hand, 3D culture downregulated glutaminolytic flux. Consistent with 
      our findings, 3D-cultured cells are more resistant to a glutaminase inhibitor
      than 2D-cultured cells. This study suggests the importance of considering the
      metabolic characteristics of the particular in vitro model used for research on
      cancer metabolism.

AB  - The expression of the neuroendocrine markers synaptophysin and chromogranin A was
      analyzed by immunohistochemistry in 14,584 samples from 103 different tumor types
      and subtypes in a tissue microarray format. At least one of these markers was
      found to be positive in 96.7% of tumors from various subtypes of neuroendocrine
      neoplasms. In non-neuroendocrine tumors, synaptophysin and/or chromogranin A
      staining was seen in 6.3% (n=584), specifically in 41 of 88 non-neuroendocrine
      tumor entities. Basal cell carcinomas of the skin (50% positive for chromogranin 
      A alone) and adrenocortical carcinomas (91.7% positive for synaptophysin alone)
      stood out due to a frequent expression of only one specific marker. A subdivision
      of non-neuroendocrine neoplasms revealed "neuroendocrine differentiation" most
      commonly in adenocarcinomas from the female genital tract (18.9%), from
      pancreatico-/hepato-/biliary tract (15.8%) and the prostate (14.9%) while it was 
      rare in urothelial (1.0%) and squamous cell carcinomas (0.6%). A comparison with 
      clinico-pathological parameters of tumor aggressiveness did not suggest a
      clinical significance of neuroendocrine marker expression in 204 endometrium
      cancers, 249 pancreatic adenocarcinomas, 233 gastric adenocarcinomas and 1,182
      colorectal adenocarcinomas. Within a cohort of 1,073 breast cancers of no special
      type, synaptophysin positivity was seen in 4.9% of cases and it was significantly
      linked to advanced tumor stage (p=0.0427), high tumor grade (p=0.0319) and loss
      of estrogen receptor expression (p=0.0061) but unrelated to patient outcome. In
      conclusion, "neuroendocrine differentiation" can be observed in many different
      tumor types with non-neuroendocrine morphology. Evidence for a statistically
      significant association (p<0.0001) between such a "neuroendocrine
      differentiation" and tumor aggressiveness could not be found.

AB  - Chronic allograft dysfunction with progressive fibrosis of unknown cause remains 
      a major issue after kidney transplantation, characterized by ischemia-reperfusion
      injury (IRI). One hypothesis to account for this is that spontaneous progressive 
      tubulointerstitial fibrosis following IRI is driven by cellular senescence
      evolving from a prolonged, unresolved DNA damage response (DDR). Since cellular
      communication network factor 2 ((CCN2), formerly called connective tissue growth 
      factor), an established mediator of kidney fibrosis, is also involved in
      senescence associated pathways, we investigated the relation between CCN2 and
      cellular senescence following kidney transplantation. Tubular CCN2 overexpression
      was found to be associated with DDR, loss of kidney function and
      tubulointerstitial fibrosis in both the early and the late phase in human kidney 
      allograft biopsies. Consistently, CCN2 deficient mice developed reduced
      senescence and tubulointerstitial fibrosis in the late phase; six weeks after
      experimental IRI. Moreover, tubular DDR markers and plasma urea were less
      elevated in CCN2 knockout than in wild type mice. Finally, CCN2 administration or
      overexpression in epithelial cells induced upregulation of tubular
      senescence-associated genes including p21, while silencing of CCN2 alleviated DDR
      induced by anoxia-reoxygenation injury in cultured proximal tubule epithelial
      cells. Thus, our observations indicate that inhibition of CCN2 can mitigate
      IRI-induced acute kidney injury, DNA damage, and the subsequent
      DDR-senescence-fibrosis sequence. Hence, targeting CCN2 might help to protect the
      kidney from transplantation associated post-IRI chronic kidney dysfunction.

AB  - Tripartite motif containing 37 (TRIM37) was reported to function as a tumor
      promoter in the development of various cancers. However, the biological role of
      TRIM37 in ovarian cancer (OC) was still unclear. Expressions of TRIM37 and HUWE1 
      were detected by qRT-PCR and western blotting in OC cells. Cell proliferation was
      evaluated by CCK-8 assay and colony formation assay. Cell migration and invasion 
      capabilities were examined by wound healing and transwell assay. Flow cytometry
      and western blotting were performed to measure cell apoptosis. Wnt/beta-catenin
      pathway and the expression of c-Myc were identified by qRT-PCR and western
      blotting. The binding of TRIM37 and HUWE1 was predicted by STRING database and
      verified by co-immunoprecipitation. In addition, a xenograft mouse model was
      established to evaluate the effects of TRIM37 and HUWE1 on tumor growth and c-MYC
      expression in vivo. The present study revealed that TRIM37 expression was
      upregulated in OC tissues and cells. TRIM37 silencing inhibited OC cell migration
      and invasion, promoted OC cell apoptosis, and blocked Wnt/beta-catenin signaling 
      pathway, as well as suppressing c-MYC protein expression. Mechanistic studies
      suggested that TRIM37 binds to HUWE1. HUWE1 was upregulated in OC cells and
      TRIM37 promoted the c-MYC expression through targeting HUWE1. Animal experiments 
      showed that TRIM37 silencing significantly repressed the tumor growth and c-MYC
      protein level, but HUWE1 overexpression reversed the effects of TRIM37 knockdown 
      on mice with OC. Our findings revealed that TRIM37 accelerated the progression of
      OC and promoted c-MYC expression by binding to HUWE1, which provides therapeutic 
      targetsfor OC treatment.

AB  - Disruption of fetal growth results in severe consequences to human health,
      including increased fetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality, as well as
      potential lifelong health problems. Molecular mechanisms promoting fetal growth
      represent potential therapeutic strategies to treat and/or prevent fetal growth
      restriction (FGR). Here we identify a previously unknown role for the
      mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 4 (MAP3K4) in promoting fetal and 
      placental growth. We demonstrate inactivation of MAP3K4 kinase activity causes
      FGR due in part to placental insufficiency. Significantly, MAP3K4 kinase-inactive
      mice display highly penetrant lethality prior to weaning and persistent growth
      reduction of surviving adults. Additionally, we elucidate molecular mechanisms by
      which MAP3K4 promotes growth through the control of the insulin-like growth
      factor 1 receptor (IGF1R), insulin receptor (IR), and Akt signaling pathway.
      Specifically, MAP3K4 kinase inactivation in trophoblast stem (TS) cells results
      in reduced IGF1R and IR expression and decreased Akt activation. We observe these
      changes in TS cells also occur in differentiated trophoblasts created through in 
      vitro differentiation of cultured TS cells and in vivo in placental tissues
      formed by TS cells. Furthermore, we show that MAP3K4 controls this pathway by
      promoting Igf1r transcript expression in TS cells through activation of CREB
      binding protein (CBP). In the MAP3K4 kinase-inactive TS cells, Igf1r transcripts 
      are repressed due to reduced CBP activity and increased histone deacetylase 6
      (HDAC6) expression and activity. Together, these data demonstrate a critical role
      for MAP3K4 in promoting fetal and placental growth by controlling the activity of
      the IGF1R/IR and Akt signaling pathway.

      of human coronaviruses.

AB  - The Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses mediates host cell entry 
      and is S-acylated on multiple phylogenetically conserved cysteine residues.
      Multiple protein acyltransferase enzymes have been reported to
      post-translationally modify Spike proteins; however, strategies to exploit this
      modification are currently lacking. Using resin-assisted capture mass
      spectrometry, we demonstrate here the Spike protein is S-acylated in
      SARS-CoV-2-infected human and monkey cells. We further show increased abundance
      of the human acyltransferase ZDHHC5 associates with increased S-acylation of the 
      Spike protein, whereas ZDHHC5 knockout cells had a 40% reduction in the
      incorporation of an alkynyl-palmitate using click chemistry detection. We also
      find the S-acylation of the Spike protein is not limited to palmitate, as
      clickable versions of myristate and stearate were also found on the
      immunocaptured protein. Yet, we observed ZDHHC5 was only modified when incubated 
      with alkyne-palmitate, suggesting it has specificity for this acyl-CoA, and that 
      other ZDHHC enzymes may use additional fatty acids to modify the Spike protein.
      Since multiple ZDHHC isoforms may modify the Spike protein, we also examined the 
      ability of the fatty acid synthase inhibitor TVB-3166 to prevent S-acylation of
      the Spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and human CoV-229E. We show treating cells with 
      TVB-3166 inhibited S-acylation of ectopically expressed Spike and attenuated the 
      ability of SARS-CoV-2 and human CoV-229E to spread in vitro. Our findings further
      substantiate the necessity of CoV Spike protein S-acylation and demonstrate that 
      de novo fatty acid synthesis is critical for the proper S-acylation of the Spike 
      protein.

AB  - Exosomes transfer molecules horizontally to surrounding cells and therefore have 
      a key role in cancer progression. To clarify the role of exosomes in cancer
      progression, trace amounts of proteins in their lumen and membrane fractions
      should be analyzed separately. For this purpose, an adequate and easy-to-use
      method of separating the lumen and membrane fractions of exosomes must be
      developed. Further, because exosomes contain only trace amounts of proteins, an
      ultrasensitive protein detection method is necessary. To develop an adequate and 
      easy-to-use lumen and membrane fraction separation method, we applied a
      commercially available kit originally developed for cells to exosomes and
      examined the validity of the results compared with those obtained using a
      conventional, complicated Na2CO3 method. To develop an ultrasensitive protein
      detection method, we designated GRP78, which is upregulated in cancer cells and
      contributes to cancer progression, as the target protein and detected it at the
      subattomolar level using an ultrasensitive ELISA combined with thio-NAD cycling. 
      By applying these methods together, GRP78 was successfully quantified in both the
      lumen and membrane fractions of exosomes obtained from cultured cancer cells. The
      present results will facilitate studies to broaden our understanding of the tumor
      microenvironment.

TI  - Predicting Non-home Discharge after Lung Surgery: Analysis of the General
      Thoracic Surgery Database.

LID - 10.1016/j.athoracsur.2022.07.020 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anticipating the need for non-home discharge (NHD) enables improved
      patient counseling and expedites placement, potentially reducing length of stay
      and hospital readmission. The objective of this study was to create a simple,
      preoperative, clinical prediction tool for NHD using the Society of Thoracic
      Surgeons General Thoracic Surgery Database (STS GTSD). METHODS: The STS GTSD was 
      queried for patients who underwent elective anatomic lung cancer resection
      between 2009-2019. Exclusion criteria included age<18, DLCO< 20% or >150%, N3 or 
      M1 disease, incomplete datasets, and mortality. The primary outcome was defined
      as discharge to an extended care, transitional care, rehabilitation center, or
      another hospital. Multivariable logistic regression was used to select risk
      factors and a nomogram for predicting risk of NHD was developed. The approach was
      cross validated in 100 replications of a training set consisting of randomly
      selected 2/3(rd) of the cohort and a validation set of remaining patients.
      RESULTS: A total of 35948 patients from the STS GTSD met inclusion criteria.
      Final model variables used to derive the nomogram for NHD risk prediction
      included age (P<0.001), DLCO% (P<0.001), open surgery (P0.001), cerebrovascular
      history (P<0.001), and Zubrod score (P<0.001). The ROC curve, using sensitivities
      and specificities of the model, yielded AUC =0.74. In 100 replicated
      cross-validations, out-of-sample AUC ranged 0.72-0.76. CONCLUSIONS: Using readily
      available preoperative variables, our nomogram prognosticates the risk of
      non-home discharge after anatomic lung resection with good discriminatory
      ability. Such risk stratification can enable improved patient counseling and
      facilitate better planning of patients' post-operative needs.

TI  - Effect of Concomitant Drug Use on the Onset and Exacerbation of Diabetes Mellitus
      in Everolimus-Treated Cancer.
PG  - 245-252

AB  - PURPOSE: Everolimus-induced diabetes mellitus (DM) outcomes include
      everolimus-resistant tumors and poor hyperglycemia outcomes, which lead to
      various other negative clinical outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate the effect
      of associations between concomitant drug treatment and time to DM event
      occurrence (onset or exacerbation) on the outcomes of everolimus-induced DM in
      patients with cancer. METHODS: Data from the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report
      database (JADER) were used, and patient drug use, time of DM event occurrence,
      and DM outcomes were determined from patient records. Associations between
      concomitant drug groups with everolimus and DM event occurrence were then
      evaluated for patients with both good and poor DM outcomes. RESULTS: Top ten
      groups used concomitantly were drugs for the treatment of hypertension (HT),
      controlled DM, constipation, hypothyroidism, kidney disease, insomnia,
      hyperlipidemia, hyperuricemia, anemia, and gastritis. Among them, only HT,
      controlled DM, and hyperlipidemia were associated with DM event occurrence. These
      three drug groups were examined by the outcome of everolimus concomitant usage
      and revealed a significantly shorter time to DM event occurrence for patients
      with poor outcomes than for those with good outcomes (p = 0.015) among patients
      without a concomitant drug for DM. Each of these three drug groups was analyzed
      on patients who were concomitantly administered with one of each drug group with 
      everolimus and revealed a significantly shorter time to DM event occurrence for
      patients with poor outcomes than for those with good outcomes in patients who
      received concomitant HT drugs (p = 0.006). Moreover, among the four HT drug
      categories, calcium channel blockers were significantly associated with poor
      outcomes (odds ratio, 2.18 [1.09-4.34], p = 0.028). CONCLUSION: To prevent
      everolimus-induced poor DM outcomes, early DM detection and treatment are
      necessary, and the effect of the concomitant drug should be considered before
      initiating everolimus treatment.

AB  - Although COVID-19 vaccines have been developed, multiple pathogenic coronavirus
      species exist, urging on development of multispecies coronavirus vaccines. Here
      we develop prototype lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-mRNA vaccine candidates against
      SARS-CoV-2 Delta, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, and we test how multiplexing LNP-mRNAs 
      can induce effective immune responses in animal models. Triplex and duplex
      LNP-mRNA vaccinations induce antigen-specific antibody responses against
      SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. Single-cell RNA sequencing profiles the
      global systemic immune repertoires and respective transcriptome signatures of
      vaccinated animals, revealing a systemic increase in activated B cells and
      differential gene expression across major adaptive immune cells. Sequential
      vaccination shows potent antibody responses against all three species,
      significantly stronger than simultaneous vaccination in mixture. These data
      demonstrate the feasibility, antibody responses, and single-cell immune profiles 
      of multispecies coronavirus vaccination. The direct comparison between
      simultaneous and sequential vaccination offers insights into optimization of
      vaccination schedules to provide broad and potent antibody immunity against three
      major pathogenic coronavirus species.

TI  - Development of alimentary tract organs for ICRP pediatric mesh- type reference
      computational phantoms.
LID - 10.1088/1361-6498/ac8683 [doi]
AB  - In line with the activities of Task Group 103 under the International Commission 
      on Radiological Protection (ICRP), the present study developed a new set of
      alimentary tract organs consisting of the oral cavity, oesophagus, stomach, small
      intestine, and colon for newborn, 1-year-old, 5-year-old, 10-year-old, and
      15-year-old males and females for use in the pediatric mesh-type reference
      computational phantoms (MRCPs). The developed alimentary tract organs of the
      pediatric MRCPs, while nearly preserving the original topology and shape of those
      of the pediatric voxel-type reference computational phantoms (VRCPs) of ICRP
      Publication 143, present considerable anatomical improvement and include all
      micrometer-scale target and source regions prescribed in ICRP Publication 100. To
      investigate the dosimetric impact of the developed alimentary tract organs, organ
      doses and specific absorbed fractions (SAFs) were computed for certain external
      exposures to photons and electrons and internal exposures to electrons,
      respectively, which were then compared with the values computed using the current
      ICRP models (i.e. pediatric VRCPs and ICRP-100 stylized models). The results
      showed that for external exposures to penetrating radiations (i.e. photons >0.04 
      MeV), there was generally good agreement between the compared values, within a
      10% difference, except for the oral mucosa. For external exposures to weakly
      penetrating radiations (i.e. low-energy photons and electrons), there were
      significant differences, up to a factor of ~8,300, owing to the geometric
      difference caused by the anatomical enhancement in the MRCPs. For internal
      exposures of electrons, there were significant differences, the maximum of which 
      reached a factor of ~73,000. This was attributed not only to the geometric
      difference but also to the target mass difference caused by the different luminal
      content mass and shape.

AB  - PURPOSE: We aimed to investigate the role of dual-phase FDG PET/CT in predicting 
      the prognosis of patients with operable breast cancer. METHODS: We
      retrospectively reviewed the data of 998 patients who underwent radical treatment
      for breast cancer. Before treatment, PET/CT scans were performed 1 and 2 h after 
      FDG administration. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) at both time
      points (SUVmax1 and SUVmax2) in the primary tumor and the retention index (RI)
      were calculated. PET recurrence risk (PET-RR) was determined based on the SUVmax1
      and RI, and disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated 
      according to the metabolic parameters. Propensity score matching was performed to
      adjust for biological characteristics. RESULTS: The cut-off values for SUVmax1
      and RI were 3 and 5%, respectively. The 5-year DFS was 94.9% and 86.1% (P <
      0.001), and the 5-year OS was 97.6% and 92.7% (P < 0.001) in the low and high
      PET-RR groups, respectively. In multivariate analysis, high T status, nodal
      metastasis, the triple-negative subtype, and high PET-RR were independent factors
      of poor DFS. Propensity score matching revealed similar findings (5-year DFS
      91.8% vs. 88.6%, P = 0.041 and 5-year OS 97.1% vs. 94.2%, P = 0.240,
      respectively). CONCLUSION: The combined parameters of SUVmax1 and RI on
      dual-phase FDG PET/CT were useful for predicting prognosis of patients with
      breast cancer. Patients with a high SUVmax1 and a negative time course of FDG
      uptake had a favorable prognosis.

TI  - Efficacy of neoadjuvant treatment with or without pertuzumab in patients with
      stage II and III HER2-positive breast cancer: a nationwide cohort analysis of
      pathologic response and 5-year survival.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pathologic complete response (pCR) rates in early stage HER2-positive
      breast cancer improved after pertuzumab was added to neoadjuvant treatment.
      However, survival benefit is less-well established and seems mostly limited to
      node-positive patients. We used national cancer registry data to compare outcomes
      of patients treated with and without pertuzumab. METHODS: We identified stage
      II-III HER2-positive breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant
      trastuzumab-based chemotherapy between November 2013 until January 2016 from the 
      Netherlands Cancer Registry. During that period pertuzumab was only available in 
      the 37 hospitals that participated in the TRAIN-2 study. Missing grade and
      pCR-status were obtained from the Dutch Pathology Registry (PALGA) and cause of
      death from Statistics Netherlands. We used multiple imputation to impute missing 
      data, multivariable logistic regression to evaluate the association between
      pertuzumab and pCR (ypT0/is, ypN0) and multivariable Cox regression models for
      overall survival and breast cancer specific survival (BCSS). RESULTS: We
      identified 1124 patients of whom 453 received pertuzumab. Baseline
      characteristics were comparable, although tumor grade was missing more often in
      patients treated without pertuzumab (12% vs. 2%). Pertuzumab improved pCR rates
      (41% vs 65%, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.91; 95% CI:2.20-3.94). After a median
      follow-up of 6.0 years, 5-year BCSS rates were 95% and 98% respectively (adjusted
      hazard ratio [aHR]: 0.58; 95% CI:0.36-0.95). Younger patients derived more
      benefit from pertuzumab, but no other significant interactions were found.
      CONCLUSION: These results support earlier data of a small survival benefit with
      the addition of pertuzumab to trastuzumab-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy which is
      most meaningful in younger patients.

TI  - Simple oncoplastic breast defect closure improves long-term cosmetic outcome of
      breast conserving surgery for breast cancer: A randomised controlled trial.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Breast conserving surgery (BCS) is associated with unsatisfactory
      cosmetic outcomes in up to 30% of patients, carrying psychological and
      quality-of-life implications. This study compares long-term cosmetic outcomes
      after BCS for breast cancer with v without simple oncoplastic defect closure.
      METHODS: A randomised controlled trial was performed, recruiting patients who
      underwent BCS over four years and randomising to the "reshaping" group (closure
      of excision defect with mobilised breast tissue; n = 124) and to the "control"
      group (no attempt at defect closure; n = 109). The estimated excision volume
      (EEV) was <20% of breast volume (BV) in both groups. Photography and breast
      retraction assessment (BRA) were recorded preoperatively. Cosmetic outcomes were 
      blindly assessed annually for five years by BRA, panel assessment of patients,
      and body image questionnaire (BIQ). RESULTS: There were no significant
      differences between the reshaping and control groups in mean age (52.4 v 53.0; p 
      = 0.63), body mass index (27.8 v 27.7; p = 0.80), margin re-excision (9 v 9; p = 
      0.78), mean BV (562.5 v 590.3 cc; p = 0.56), mean EEV (54.6 v 60.1 cc; p = 0.14),
      mean EEV/BV ratio (11.2 v 11.0; p = 0.84), or mean specimen weight (52.1 v 57.7
      g; p = 0.24). Reshaping group patients had significantly better outcomes compared
      to control group patients in terms of mean BRA (0.9 v 2.8; p < 0.0001), achieving
      a score of "good" or "excellent" by panel assessment at 5 years (75.8% v 48%, p <
      0.0001), body image questionnaire top score at 5 years (66.9% v 35.8%; p =
      0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Simple oncoplastic closure of defects after
      breast-conserving surgery improves long-term objective and subjective cosmetic
      outcomes.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 easily infects human monocytes, macrophages and possibly dendritic
      cells (DCs), causing dysfunctions of these important antigen presenting cells
      (APCs). Observed DC dysfunctions facilitate improper antigen presentation, which 
      obviously results T cell anergy, exhaustion and apoptosis, thus, may be
      contributing significantly in SARS-CoV-2 infection associated lymphopenia. Neem
      Leaf Glycoprotein or NLGP has enormous role in altered DC functions, thereby,
      offering optimum T cell mediated cytotoxicity, as experienced from cancer system.
      Such NLGP guided correction of altered DCs might also be effective to generate
      proper SARS-CoV-2-specific effector and central memory T cells.

AB  - Long-standing inflammatory bowel disease predisposes to the development of
      colorectal cancer (CRC). Interleukin (IL) -6, a pivotal link between chronic
      inflammation and tumor progression, has recently been recognized as a potential
      therapeutic target. The effect of IL-6 on proliferation and metastasis of CRC by 
      activating the STAT3 pathway has been widely demonstrated in recent years, but
      few on mediating tumor immune evasion. In this study, we found that IL-6 was
      remarkably overexpressed in CRC and its elevation was associated with a poor
      prognosis. We studied CRC tumorigenesis in vivo by inoculating MC38 tumors and
      induced-CRC model via AOM/DSS (azoxymethane/dextransulfate sodium) in IL-6
      deficient (IL-6(-/-)) and wild-type (WT) mice and found that IL-6(-/-) mice were 
      less susceptible to develop tumors, compared to WT mice. We detected CD8(+) T
      cells via immunofluorescence and found they exhibit high expression in tumor of
      IL-6(-/-) mice. High level of IL-6 was found in colitis model, with
      down-regulation of MHC-I molecules. In in vitro experiments, we found that IL-6
      may act as a negative regulator in IFNgamma-STAT1-MHC-I signaling. In addition,
      vivo trials also confirmed that MHC-I mRNA level was negatively related to the
      existence of IL-6. Furthermore, the blockade of IL-6 also activated CD8(+)T-cell 
      accumulation and led to the high PD-L1 expression in CRC, which can sensitize
      animals to anti-PD-1 therapy. Our study provides a research basis for the
      significant role of IL-6 in tumor evasion and highlights a novel target to
      improve the efficacy of immunotherapy.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs containing 19-26 nucleotides, and they
      directly regulate the translation of mRNAs by binding to them. MiRNAs participate
      in various physiological processes and are associated with the development of
      diseases, such as cancer. Therefore, understanding miRNAs regulation on targets
      is crucial for understanding the mechanisms of diseases and for obtaining a more 
      suitable treatment. In animals, the base complementarity between miRNAs and the
      mRNA is imperfect, hindering the prediction of these targets. Thus, over the past
      15 years, several computational tools have emerged for the prediction of miRNA
      targets in animals, generally with a focus on human expression data. Taking into 
      account the wide range of prediction tools, a systematic review is presented here
      to analyze and classify these methods and features to enable the most appropriate
      choice according to the needs of each researcher. In this study, only articles
      whose methods met the inclusion and exclusion criteria established in the
      protocol were considered. The search was performed in November 2020, in two
      search engines PubMed and VHL Regional Portal. Among the initial 5315 journals
      found in the two searches, 78 articles were accepted, comprising 49 different
      tools analyzed and grouped by features and method similarities. As we limited our
      criteria to animals, all tools found in our search were suitable for human
      studies. The results demonstrated the evolution of prediction tools, including
      the most used features, such as alignment and thermodynamics, the methods used,
      as well as performance issues. It is possible to conclude that the currently
      available miRNA target prediction tools and methods can be aggregated with new
      features or other methods to improve accuracy.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has severely affected cancer
      care and research by disrupting the prevention and treatment paths as well as the
      preclinical, clinical, and translational research ecosystem. In Italy, this has
      been particularly significant given the severity of the pandemic's impact and the
      intrinsic vulnerabilities of the national health system. However, whilst
      detrimental, disruption can also be constructive and may stimulate innovation and
      progress. The Italian Association of Medical Oncology (AIOM) has recognized the
      impact of COVID-19 on cancer care continuum and research and proposes the '2021
      Matera statement' which aims at providing pragmatic guidance for policymakers and
      health care institutions to mitigate the impact of the global health crisis on
      Italian oncology and design the recovery plan for the post-pandemic scenario. The
      interventions are addressed both to the pillars (prevention, diagnosis,
      treatment, follow-up, health care professionals) and foundations of cancer care
      (communication and care relationship, system organization, resources, research,
      networking). The priorities to be implemented can be summarized in the MATERA
      acronym: Multidisciplinarity; Access to cancer care; Telemedicine and
      Territoriality; Equity, ethics, education; Research and resources; Alliance
      between stakeholders and patients.

TI  - Phase I, first-in-human study of MSC-1 (AZD0171), a humanized anti-leukemia
      inhibitory factor monoclonal antibody, for advanced solid tumors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Activation of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is linked to an
      immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), with a strong association between
      LIF expression and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). MSC-1 (AZD0171) is a
      humanized monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to LIF, promoting
      antitumor inflammation through TAM modulation and cancer stem cell inhibition,
      slowing tumor growth. In this phase I, first-in-human, open-label,
      dose-escalation study, MSC-1 monotherapy was assessed in patients with advanced, 
      unresectable solid tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using accelerated-titration
      dose escalation followed by a 3 + 3 design, MSC-1 doses of 75-1500 mg were
      administered intravenously every 3 weeks (Q3W) until progression or unmanageable 
      toxicity. Additional patients were enrolled in selected cohorts to further
      evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics after escalation to 
      the next dose had been approved. The primary objective was characterizing safety 
      and determining the recommended phase II dose (RP2D). Evaluating antitumor
      activity and progression-free survival (PFS) by RECIST v1.1, PK and
      immunogenicity were secondary objectives. Exploratory objectives included
      pharmacodynamic effects on circulating LIF and TME immune markers. RESULTS:
      Forty-one patients received treatment. MSC-1 monotherapy was safe and well
      tolerated at all doses, with no dose-limiting toxicities. The maximum tolerated
      dose was not reached and the RP2D was determined to be 1500 mg Q3W. Almost half
      of the patients had treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs), with no apparent
      trends across doses; no patients withdrew due to TRAEs. There were no objective
      responses; 23.7% had stable disease for >/=2 consecutive tumor assessments.
      Median PFS was 5.9 weeks; 23.7% had PFS >16 weeks. On-treatment changes in
      circulating LIF and TME signal transducers and activators of transcription 3
      signaling, M1:M2 macrophage populations, and CD8+ T-cell infiltration were
      consistent with the hypothesized mechanism of action. CONCLUSIONS: MSC-1 was very
      well tolerated across doses, with prolonged PFS in some patients. Biomarker and
      preclinical data suggest potential synergy with checkpoint inhibitors.

AB  - Mapping the structural changes in membrane lipids, proteins, polysaccharides and 
      nucleic acids has opened new channels for understanding the mode of action of
      anticancer natural products. Earlier, we synthesized chrysin nanoparticles (NChr)
      with good bioavailability, and characterized its size, surface charge, entrapment
      efficiency, and drug release pattern using PLGA polymer. NChr induced
      concentration dependent cytotoxicity in HeLa cells with an IC50 of 61.54 +/- 1.2 
      microM in comparison with free chrysin with IC50 of 86.51 +/- 2.9 microM. Since
      nanoparticles interact dynamically with cell membranes, organelles, proteins and 
      DNA, it is necessary to understand the interplay of nanodrug induced
      macromolecular changes in cancer cells. In this work, we obtained signatures of
      NChr-induced biochemical changes in HeLa cells by Attenuated Total
      Reflectance-Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy technique coupled with flow
      cytometry. NChr induced cell membrane disruption, G1 phase cell cycle arrest, and
      increased externalization of phosphatidylserine leading to apoptosis indicating
      the biochemical perturbations in membrane lipids and DNA of HeLa cells in
      comparison with untreated cells. The 1300-1000 cm(-1) spectral region indicated
      NChr interaction with the ribose sugar backbone and DNA denaturation. Spectral
      range 1800-1400 cm(-1) indicated a concentration dependent decrease in alpha
      helical and beta sheet structures which may lead to protein degradation during
      apoptosis. The spectral range 3000-2800 cm(-1) indicated the lipid peroxidation
      in response to NChr treatment. This is the first study describing the
      bio-macromolecular changes induced by a nano encapsulated drug and can pave the
      way to investigate unconventional modes of action for bioactive formulations.

AB  - Natural killer cells (NKs) hold great promise in cancer treatment, but their
      application in solid tumors remains a great challenge because current solutions
      hardly can overcome various difficulties that faced. Herein, we endow NKs with
      the phytochemical feature for effective immunotherapy of solid tumors. NKs are
      decorated with natural thylakoid (Tk) membranes through an efficient and
      convenient membrane fusion strategy. Tk engineering effectively activates NKs,
      because the antioxidase on Tk induce glycogen synthase kinase-3beta inhibition,
      and subsequently increase the expression of activating receptor and cytotoxic
      effector molecules in NKs. After systemic administration, the phytochemical NKs
      (PC-NKs) can target tumor tissues, and then profoundly reprogram tumor
      microenvironment (TME) with the help of catalase on Tk, resulting in
      significantly enhanced direct killing of PC-NKs and immune activated TME.
      Therefore, potent therapeutic effects with few abnormalities are achieved,
      providing a novel idea for the development of highly efficient NKs for solid
      tumors.

AB  - Type I interferon pathway is a crucial component of innate immune signaling upon 
      pathogen infection or endogenous instability. An imbalance of type I interferon
      can lead to many diseases, such as autoimmune diseases and inflammatory diseases.
      Meanwhile, the side effects of clinical drugs on type I interferon signaling may 
      result in impaired outcomes in clinical treatment, especially in cancer
      immunotherapy which is associated with type I interferon signaling. Here, we
      found that sorafenib, an FDA-approved drug for HCC chemotherapy, suppresses both 
      DNA- and RNA-sensing mediated type I interferon pathway. Mechanistically,
      sorafenib treatment induces the autophagic degradation of MAVS, cGAS, TBK1, and
      IRF3, and attenuates the signaling transduction. In addition, sorafenib also
      inhibits the recruiting of STING or MAVS with TBK1 and IRF3. This work reveals
      the negative role of sorafenib in the regulation of type I interferon pathway.
      Sorafenib treatment is not only a potential drug for autoimmune disease and
      inflammation diseases, but also needs to be noticed in HCC chemotherapy.

AB  - Bladder cancer is a common urinary cancer that still lacks effective treatments. 
      In the present study, we evaluated the effect of BET inhibitor, mivebresib, in
      combination with PZ703b, a Bcl-xl PROTAC, on apoptosis in bladder cancer cells.
      The results revealed that mivebresib and PZ703b synergistically decreased the
      viabilities of bladder cancer cells. Co-treatment of mivebresib and PZ703b
      induced apoptosis in bladder cancer cells via the mitochondrial pathway in a
      caspase-dependent manner. Mechanistically, mivebresib and PZ703b treatment
      inhibited the expression of Mcl-1 and Bcl-xl, accompanied by upregulation of Bim.
      Hence, co-treatment of mivebresib and PZ703b rebalanced the level of pro- and
      anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins in cells. Further investigations showed that forced
      expression of Mcl-1 or Bcl-xl markedly protected bladder cancer cells from
      apoptosis induced by combination treatment of mivebresib and PZ703b. In addition,
      knockdown of Bim also inhibited the cell death induced by mivebresib/PZ703b in
      bladder cancer cells. In summary, our findings reveal that the combination
      treatment of mivebresib and PZ703b represents a novel promising strategy to treat
      bladder cancer.

      deficiency by UPLC-Q/TOF-MS and molecular docking.

AB  - Er-Zhi-Wan (EZW), a classical traditional Chinese formulation, has attracted more
      and more attention. This study was carried out to analyze the constituents of EZW
      absorbed into blood and find out the potential active ingredients for treating
      osteoporosis (OP) with kidney-yin deficiency (KYD). The rat model of OP with KYD 
      was achieved by ovariectomies and using the mixture of thyroxine and reserpine.
      Then ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with a quadrupole
      time-of-flight mass spectrometer (UPLC-Q/TOF-MS) combined with statistical
      analysis was used to analyze the constituents of EZW absorbed into blood and
      differential components between the normal and OP with KYD rats. Finally, the
      components identified in OP with KYD rats were docked with targets of OP with KYD
      found in online databases. The results of molecular docking were adopted to find 
      the potential active ingredients and further verified in vitro experiment. A
      total of 21 prototype compounds and 69 metabolites were identified in serum.
      Among them, 63 components in model rats and 50 components in normal rats were
      summarized, respectively. Most of the identified metabolites in serum of model
      rats were produced by hydrolysis, oxidation or glucuronidation, while in serum of
      normal rats were produced by hydrolysis, oxidation and methylation. According to 
      the results of molecular docking, specnuezhenide, salidroside, tyrosol,
      echinacoside and verbascoside could be classified as potential active
      ingredients. The activity of salidroside and a metabolite was verified by
      pharmacodynamics analysis. In summary, UPLC-Q/TOF-MS system was combined with
      molecular docking to search the potential active ingredients from model rats of
      OP with KYD, which provided a new idea for the research on the pharmacodynamic
      material basis of other traditional medicine. Moreover, the result of this study 
      lays the foundation for further study regarding the mechanism of EZW in treating 
      OP with KYD.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Carcinoma ex Pleomorphic Adenoma (CXPA) is a rare primary salivary
      gland malignancy, typically arising from a pre-existing pleomorphic adenoma. This
      systematic review examines prognostic factors affecting overall survival (OS) in 
      major and minor salivary gland CXPA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Systematic review of 
      MEDLINE, Cochrane, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Open Grey databases from
      inception to 31st March 2022 for all English-language literature pertaining to
      'carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma'. All study types with greater than five
      patients with CXPA of the major and minor salivary glands were eligible for
      inclusion. RESULTS: Of 8143 studies, 39 studies (n = 5637 patients) meeting the
      inclusion criteria were included. Median OS at one, three, five, and ten years
      were 90.0 %, 72.0 %, 61.9 %, and 45.0 % respectively for all CXPA. Higher
      staging, T stage, nodal disease, grading, and invasion >/= 1.5 mm had worse
      outcomes. Histological subtype, perineural invasion, and radiotherapy did not
      demonstrate a consistent trend. Three studies were evaluated to have high risk of
      bias, and was removed for sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSION: Survival outcomes
      worsen with time for all salivary gland CXPA. Further research on
      histopathological features and the utility of radiation therapy is required to
      guide patient selection for more aggressive treatment. REGISTRATION:

AB  - Chemotherapy is severely limited by continuously decreased therapeutic efficacy
      and uncontrolled side effects on normal tissue, which can be improved by
      constructing a nanoparticle-based drug delivery system (DDS). Nevertheless, no
      studies have reported on DDS-based on carbon-nanodots (CNDs), combining
      subcellular organelle-targeted imaging/drug delivery, high drug loading content, 
      and glutathione (GSH)-sensitive drug release into one system. Herein, the
      as-fabricated CNDs can be covalently conjugated with a mitochondria-targeting
      ligand (triphenylphosphine, TPP), a smart GSH-responsive disulfide linker (S-S), 
      and the anticancer drug (camptothecin, CPT) to initially prepare a theranostic
      nano-DDS (TPP-CNDs-S-CPT) with the drug loading efficiency of 64.6 wt%. Owing to 
      excellent water dispersibility, superior fluorescence properties, satisfactory
      cell permeability, and favorable biocompatibility, TPP-CNDs-S-CPT was
      successfully used for intracellular mitochondrial-targeted imaging in vitro. High
      intracellular GSH concentrations in tumor cells caused the cleavage of S-S,
      resulting in concomitant activation and release of CPT, as well as significant
      fluorescence enhancement. In vivo, TPP-CNDs-S-CPT exhibited lower biological
      toxicity and even higher tumor-activatable performance than free CPT, as well as 
      specific cancer therapy with few side effects. The mitochondria-targeted ability 
      and the precise drug-release in tumor make TPP-CNDs-S-CPT a hopeful chemotherapy 
      prodrug, providing significant theoretical basis and data support for in-depth
      understanding and exploration of chemotherapeutic DDS-based on CNDs.

TI  - Development of a Novel Multi-dimensional Measure of Aging to Predict Mortality
      and Morbidity in the Prospective MJ Cohort.
LID - glac161 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/gerona/glac161 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although biological aging has been proposed as a more accurate
      measure of aging, few biological aging measures have been developed for Asians,
      especially for young adults. METHODS: A total of 521,656 participants were
      enrolled in the MJ cohort (1996 -2011) and were followed until death,
      loss-to-follow-up, or Dec 31, 2011, whichever came first. We selected 14 clinical
      biomarkers including chronological age using random forest algorithm and
      developed a multi-dimensional aging measure (MDAge). Model performance was
      assessed by area under the curve (AUC) and internal calibration. We evaluated the
      associations of MDAge and residuals from regressing MDAge on chronological age
      (MDAgeAccel) with mortality and morbidity, and assessed the robustness of our
      findings. RESULTS: MDAge achieved an excellent AUC of 0.892 in predicting
      all-cause mortality (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.889-0.894). Participants
      with higher MDAge at baseline were at a higher risk of death (per 5 years,
      HR=1.671, 95%CI: 1.662-1.680), and the association remained after controlling for
      other variables and in different subgroups. Furthermore, participants with higher
      MDAgeAccel were associated with shortened life expectancy. For instance, compared
      to men who were biologically younger (MDAgeAccel</=0) at baseline, men in the
      highest tertiles of MDAgeAccel had shortened life expectancy by 17.23 years. In
      addition, higher MDAgeAccel was associated with having chronic disease either
      cross-sectionally (per 1-SD, OR=1.564, 95%CI: 1.552-1.575) or longitudinally (per
      1-SD, OR=1.218, 95% CI: 1.199-1.238). CONCLUSIONS: MDAge accurately predicted
      mortality and morbidity, which has great potential in the early identification of
      individuals at higher risk, and therefore promoting early intervention.

TI  - Arsenic Prodrug-Mediated Tumor Microenvironment Modulation Platform for
      Synergetic Glioblastoma Therapy.
LID - 10.1021/acsami.2c12076 [doi]
AB  - Glioblastoma (GBM) has a distinct internal environment characterized by high
      levels of glutathione (GSH) and low oxygen partial pressure, which significantly 
      restrict most drugs' effectiveness. Arsenic-based drugs are emerging candidates
      for treating solid tumors; however, relatively high doses in solo systems and
      inconsistent complementary systems severely damage the normal tissues. We
      proposed a novel covalently conjugated strategy for arsenic-based therapy via
      arsenic-boronic acid complex formation. The boronic acid was modified on silver
      (AgL) to capture As(V) under an alkaline condition named arsenate plasmonic
      complex (APC) with a distinct Raman response. The APC can precisely release the
      captured As(V) in lysosomal acidic pH that specifically targets TME to initiate a
      multimodal therapeutic effect such as GSH depletion and reactive oxygen species
      generation. In addition, GSH activation leads to subconverted As(V) into As(III),
      which further facilitated glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase
      inhibition, whereas the tumor selective etching of the silver core triggered by
      endogenous H2O2 that can oxidize to generate highly toxic Ag ions produces and
      supplies O2 to help the alleviated hypoxia. Both in vitro and in vivo data verify
      the APC-based chemotherapy paving the way for efficient nanomedicine-enabled
      boronate affinity-based arsenic chemotherapeutics for on demand site-specific
      cancer combination treatment of GBM tumors.

TI  - Coordination-Regulated Terpyridine-Mn(II) Complexes for Photodynamic Therapy
      Guided by Multiphoton Fluorescence/Magnetic Resonance Imaging.
LID - 10.1021/acs.inorgchem.2c01603 [doi]
AB  - The synergy of multiphoton fluorescence imaging (MP-FI) and magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) provides an imaging platform with high resolution and unlimited
      penetration depth for early disease detection. Herein, two kinds of
      terpyridine-Mn(II) complexes (FD-Mn-O2NO and FD-Mn-FD) possessing seven and six
      coordination modes, respectively, were designed rationally for photodynamic
      therapy (PDT) guided by MP-FI/MRI. The complexes obtain different multiphoton
      fluorescence/magnetic resonance properties by adjusting the number of terpyridine
      ligands. Among them, FD-Mn-FD exhibits the following superiorities: (1) The
      optimal three-photon excitation wavelength of FD-Mn-FD falls at 1450 nm (NIR-II),
      which brings high sensitivity and deep tissue penetration in MP-FI. (2) FD-Mn-FD 
      has effective longitudinal relaxation efficiency (r1 = 2.6 m M(-1) s(-1)), which 
      can be used for T1-weighted MRI, overcoming the problems of limited tissue
      penetration depth and low spatial resolution. (3) FD-Mn-FD generates endogenous
      (1)O2 under irradiation by 808 nm light, thereby enhancing the PDT effect in
      vitro and in vivo. To the best of our knowledge, the complex FD-Mn-FD is the
      first complex to guide PDT through MP-FI/MRI, providing a blueprint for accurate 
      and effective early detection and timely treatment of the complex in the early
      stages of cancer.

      Navigation.
LID - 10.1021/acs.analchem.2c01790 [doi]
AB  - Multimodality imaging recognized as a promising monitoring strategy can serve the
      needs of accurate diagnosis and treatment of cancer by providing molecular and
      anatomic information about tumor sites. However, the probes based on multiple
      imaging modalities for surgery navigation remain limited due to poor
      biocompatibility and tumor targeting specificity. Herein, we present a
      small-molecule near-infrared fluorescence/magnetic resonance (NIRF/MR) imaging
      probe, Gd-NMC-3, covalently coupled with DCDSTCY and Gd-DOTA via butane diamine, 
      for precise detection and intraoperative visualization. The in vitro and in vivo 
      studies demonstrated that Gd-NMC-3 could be effectively accumulated in tumor
      sites as a bimodal imaging molecule exhibiting significant fluorescence
      accumulation and reasonable relaxation property in tumors with low cytotoxicity
      and good biocompatibility. Furthermore, Gd-NMC-3 was successfully applied to
      provide real-time visual navigation in LM3 orthotopic and subcutaneous tumor
      models to guide the resection of tumors. Importantly, no more fluorescence was
      observed in mice after operation, implying the total removal of tumor tissues. In
      conclusion, Gd-NMC-3 has great potential to be applied in the clinic based on its
      high resolution and sensitivity in tumor imaging.

TI  - Target-Modulated Hydrophobic Precipitation in Photocatalytic Nanochannels for
      Sensitive Detection of Alpha Fetoprotein.
LID - 10.1021/acs.analchem.2c01937 [doi]
AB  - It is important to detect cancer biomarkers at an early stage of tumor
      development for the effective diagnosis and treatment of cancer. As a well-known 
      probe for detecting superoxide (.O2(-)) radicals, nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT)
      can rapidly react with .O2(-) to form a hydrophobic formazan precipitate. In this
      study, by deliberately utilizing this reaction, Pt asymmetrically decorated on a 
      TiO2 nanochannel membrane (Pt/TiNM) is explored to fabricate an electrochemical
      immunosensing platform with outstanding selectivity and ultrahigh sensitivity.
      Using NBT as the substrate, hydrophobic formazan precipitation induces a
      substantial block of ionic diffusion flux in nanochannels. Using alpha
      fetoprotein (AFP) as the target analyte, the established immunorecognition event 
      was used to induce MoS2-Ab2 conjugates. Thanks to the excellent light-shielding
      ability of MoS2 nanosheets, the production of .O2(-) radicals from the
      photocatalysis of Pt/TiNM is effectively depressed because of the attenuated
      arrival of light. The reduced formazan precipitation results in ionic transport
      changes in nanochannels, which in turn enables the selective recognition of AFP
      down to 2 ng mL(-1). This target-modulated sensing strategy is also capable of
      sensing other immune targets, thus paving a new way for designing
      nanochannel-based sensing platforms.

TI  - Overall Survival, Progression-Free Survival, and Tumor Response Benefit
      Supporting Initial US Food and Drug Administration Approval and Indication
      Extension of New Cancer Drugs, 2003-2021.
PG  - JCO2200535
LID - 10.1200/JCO.22.00535 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Clinical trial evidence is routinely evaluated for initial drug
      approvals, yet the benefit of indication extensions remains uncertain. This study
      evaluates the clinical benefit supporting new cancer drugs' initial and
      supplemental US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indication approval. PATIENTS 
      AND METHODS: Clinical trial evidence supporting each indication's FDA approval
      was collected from the Drugs@FDA database between 2003 and 2021. Drug,
      indication, and clinical trial characteristics are described. Hazard ratios (HRs)
      for overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and relative risk for
      tumor response were meta-analyzed. RESULTS: Out of 124 FDA-approved drugs, 78
      were approved across multiple indications. Out of 374 indications, 141 were
      approved as combination therapies, 255 for solid cancers, 121 with biomarkers,
      and 182 as first-line therapy. Approval was mostly supported by open-label (267
      [71%]) phase III (238 [64%]) concurrent randomized controlled trials (248 [66%]) 
      with a median of 331 enrolled patients (interquartile range [IQR], 123-665
      patients). Across 234 randomized controlled trials with available data, drugs'
      HRs were 0.73 (95% CI, 0.72 to 0.75; I(2) = 29.6%) for OS and 0.57 (95% CI, 0.54 
      to 0.60; I(2) = 90.6%) for PFS, whereas tumor response was 1.38 (95% CI, 1.33 to 
      1.42; I(2) = 80.7%). Novel pharmaceuticals increased patient survival by a median
      of 2.80 months (IQR, 1.97-4.60 months) for OS and 3.30 months (IQR, 1.50-5.58
      months) for PFS. Initial indications more frequently received accelerated
      approval, supported by single-arm trials for advanced-line monotherapies, than
      indication extensions. Initial approvals provided a higher PFS (HR, 0.48 v 0.58; 
      P = .002) and tumor response (relative risk, 1.76 v 1.36; P < .001). CONCLUSION: 
      New cancer drugs substantially reduce the risk of death and tumor progression,
      yet only marginally extend patient survival. The FDA, physicians, patients, and
      insurers must evaluate and decide on a drug's safety and efficacy approval,
      pricing, coverage, and reimbursement on an indication-specific level.

TI  - Lenvatinib Combined With Transarterial Chemoembolization as First-Line Treatment 
      for Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Phase III, Randomized Clinical Trial
      (LAUNCH).
PG  - JCO2200392
LID - 10.1200/JCO.22.00392 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Lenvatinib (LEN) is a first-line therapy for patients with advanced
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, it has shown modest survival benefits.
      Therefore, we aimed to compare clinical outcomes of LEN combined with
      transarterial chemoembolization (LEN-TACE) versus LEN monotherapy in patients
      with advanced HCC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a multicenter, randomized,
      open-label, parallel group, phase III trial. Patients with primary
      treatment-naive or initial recurrent advanced HCC after surgery were randomly
      assigned (1:1) to receive LEN plus on-demand TACE (LEN-TACE) or LEN monotherapy. 
      LEN was initiated within 3 days after random assignment (initial dose: 12 mg once
      daily for patients >/= 60 kg; 8 mg once daily for patients < 60 kg). TACE was
      initiated one day after LEN initiation. The primary end point was overall
      survival (OS). RESULTS: Between June 2019 and July 2021, a total of 338 patients 
      underwent random assignment at 12 centers in China: 170 to LEN-TACE and 168 to
      LEN. At a prespecified event-driven interim analysis after a median follow-up of 
      17.0 months, the median OS was significantly longer in the LEN-TACE group (17.8 v
      11.5 months; hazard ratio, 0.45; P < .001). The median progression-free survival 
      was 10.6 months in the LEN-TACE group and 6.4 months in the LEN group (hazard
      ratio, 0.43; P < .001). Patients in the LEN-TACE group had a higher objective
      response rate according to the modified RECIST (54.1% v 25.0%, P < .001).
      Multivariable analysis revealed that portal vein tumor thrombus and treatment
      allocation were independent risk factors for OS. CONCLUSION: The addition of TACE
      to LEN improves clinical outcomes and is a potential first-line treatment for
      patients with advanced HCC.

TI  - Folic Acid-Modified Cyclodextrin Multivalent Supramolecular Assembly for
      Photodynamic Therapy.
LID - 10.1021/acs.biomac.2c00276 [doi]
AB  - The construction of supramolecular multivalent assemblies with unique
      photoluminescence behaviors and biological functions has become a research hot
      spot recently in the biomaterial field. Herein, we report an adaptive
      supramolecular assembly via a multivalent co-assembly strategy prepared in two
      stages by using an adamantane-connected pyrenyl pyridinium derivative (APA2),
      sulfonated aluminum phthalocyanine (PcS), and folic acid-modified
      beta-cyclodextrin (FA-CD) for efficient dual-organelle targeted photodynamic
      cancer cell ablation. Benefiting from pi-pi and electrostatic interactions, APA2 
      and PcS could first assemble into non-fluorescent irregular nanoaggregates
      because of the heterodimer aggregation-induced quenching and then secondarily
      assemble with FA-CD to afford targeted spherical nanoparticles (NPs) with an
      average diameter of around 50 nm, which could be specifically taken up by HeLa
      cancer cells through endocytosis in comparison with 293T normal cells.
      Intriguingly, such multivalent NPs could adaptively disaggregate in an
      intracellular physiological environment of cancer cells and further respectively 
      and selectively accumulate in mitochondria and lysosomes, which not only
      displayed near-infrared two-organelle localization in situ but also aroused
      efficient singlet oxygen generation under light irradiation to effectively
      eliminate cancer cells up to 99%. This supramolecular multivalent assembly with
      an adaptive feature in a specific cancer cell environment provides a feasible
      strategy for precise organelle-targeted imaging and an efficiently synergetic
      photodynamic effect in situ for cancer cell ablation.

TI  - Association Between Immunoglobulin G4-Related Ophthalmic Disease and Nonlymphoid 
      Malignancy Case Series and Comprehensive Review of the Literature.
LID - 10.1097/WNO.0000000000001674 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) and immunoglobulin
      G4-related ophthalmic disease (IgG4-ROD) complicated with nonlymphoid malignancy 
      (NL-malignancy) are rare. No exact relationship between IgG4-RD and
      NL-malignancies has been established yet, and there have been few reports of
      different types of IgG4-ROD and related malignancies. METHODS: We retrospectively
      reviewed medical records of patients diagnosed with IgG4-RD and NL-malignancy,
      whichever occurred first, from January 2015 to March 2021. In addition, the
      literature on the relationship between IgG4-ROD and NL-malignancy was reviewed.
      RESULTS: There were 115 patients diagnosed with IgG4-RD, and 10 patients were
      enrolled in the study with NL-malignancy. Three patients were diagnosed with
      IgG4-ROD. One patient reported a previous history of cancer, and the other 2
      patients developed cancer at or after the diagnosis of IgG4-RD. The 3 patients'
      cancers were located in the lung, gastrointestinal tract, and thyroid.
      CONCLUSIONS: There may be potential malignancy occurrence during follow-up of
      IgG4-RD patients, especially among elderly patients. In addition, IgG4-RD could
      be a paraneoplastic syndrome at or before the diagnosis of malignancy.

TI  - MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE-DRIVEN TREATMENT INTENSIFICATION WITH SEQUENTIAL
      ADDITION OF IBRUTINIB TO VENETOCLAX IN R/R CLL.
LID - blood.2022016901 [pii]
LID - 10.1182/blood.2022016901 [doi]
AB  - Undetectable MRD (uMRD) is achievable in patients with CLL with the
      BCL2-inhibitor venetoclax alone or combined with the BTK-inhibitor ibrutinib.
      This phase 2 multicenter MRD-driven study was designed to discontinue treatment
      upon reaching uMRD4(<10-4) in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL receiving
      venetoclax monotherapy or after the addition of ibrutinib. Primary endpoint of
      the study was proportion of uMRD4 with venetoclax+/-ibrutinib. Secondary
      endpoints were ORR, PR, CR, PFS, DOR, OS, and safety of venetoclax+/-ibrutinib.
      Patients with uMRD4 at Cycle12Day1 discontinued venetoclax. MRD+ patients added
      ibrutinib and continued both drugs up to Cycle24Day28/uMRD4/progression/toxicity.
      After Cycle24Day28, MRD+ patients continued ibrutinib. Thirty-eight patients (29%
      with TP53-aberrations; 79% unmutated IGHV) started venetoclax. ORR with
      venetoclax was 36/38(95%) (20 complete; 16 partial response). Seventeen patients 
      (45%) with uMRD4 at Cycle12Day1 discontinued venetoclax. Nineteen (55%) MRD+
      subjects added ibrutinib. After a median of 7 months (range 3-10) of combined
      treatment, 16/19 (84%) achieved uMRD4, thus stopping both drugs. Two MRD+
      patients at Cycle 24 Day 28 continued ibrutinib until progression/toxicity. After
      a median follow-up of 36.5 months, median PFS was not reached; 10 patients
      progressed (4 restarted venetoclax, 3 without treatment need, 2 developed Richter
      transformation, 1 dropped-out). 7/32 patients (22%) remain uMRD4 after 3 years of
      follow-up. Neutropenia was the most frequent G3-4 adverse event, no grade 5
      events occurred on study. This sequential MRD-guided approach led to uMRD4 in
      33/38 patients (87%) with venetoclax monotherapy or combined with ibrutinib.,
      delivering treatment combination only in a fraction, and ultimately identifying
      the few patients benefiting from continuous therapy. Clinical trial number:
      NCT04754035.

TI  - Genome-wide CRISPR screens identify CD48 defining susceptibility to NK
      cytotoxicity in peripheral T-cell lymphomas.
LID - blood.2022015646 [pii]
LID - 10.1182/blood.2022015646 [doi]
AB  - Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is one of the aggressive peripheral T-cell 
      neoplasms with a poor prognosis. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that escape
      from adaptive immunity is a hallmark for ATLL pathogenesis. However, the
      mechanisms by which ATLL cells evade NK-cell-mediated immunity have been poorly
      understood. Here we show that CD48 expression in ATLL cells determines the
      sensitivity for NK-cell-mediated cytotoxicity against ATLL cells. We performed
      unbiased genome-wide clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat
      (CRISPR) screening using two ATLL derived cell lines and discovered CD48 as one
      of the best enriched genes whose knockout conferred resistance to YT-1 NK cell
      line mediated cytotoxicity. The ability of CD48-knockout ATLL cells to evade NK
      cell effector function was confirmed using human primary NK cells with reduced
      IFNg induction and degranulation. We found that primary ATLL cells had reduced
      CD48 expression along with disease progression. Furthermore, other subgroups
      among aggressive peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) also expressed lower levels
      of CD48 than normal T-cells, suggesting that CD48 is a key molecule in malignant 
      T-cell evasion of NK cell surveillance. Thus, this study demonstrates that CD48
      expression is likely critical for malignant T-cell lymphoma cell regulation of NK
      cell mediated immunity and provides a rationale for future evaluation of CD48 as 
      a molecular biomarker in NK cell-associated immunotherapies.

LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-22-1362 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in general have shown poor efficacy 
      in bladder cancer (BCa). The purpose of this project was to determine whether
      photodynamic therapy (PDT) with BCa-specific porphyrin-based PLZ4-nanoparticles
      (PNP) potentiated ICI. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: SV40 T/Ras double-transgenic mice
      bearing spontaneous BCa and C57BL/6 mice carrying syngeneic bladder cancer models
      were used to determine the efficacy and conduct molecular correlative studies.
      RESULTS: PDT with PNP generated reactive oxygen species, induced protein
      carbonylation and dendritic cell maturation. In SV40 T/Ras double-transgenic mice
      carrying spontaneous bladder cancer, the median survival was 33.7 days in the
      control, compared to 44.8 (p=0.0123), 52.6 (p=0.0054) and over 75 (p=0.0001) days
      in the anti-programmed cell death-1 antibody(anti-PD-1), PNP PDT and combination 
      groups, respectively. At Day 75 when all mice in other groups died, only one in 7
      mice in the combination group died. For the direct anti-tumor activity, compared 
      to the control, the ani-PD-1, PNP PDT and combination groups induced a 40.25%
      (p=0.0003), 80.72% (p<0.0001) and 93.03% (p<0.0001) tumor reduction,
      respectively. For the abscopal anti-cancer immunity, the anti-PD-1, PNP PDT and
      combination groups induced tumor reduction of 45.73% (p=0.0001), 54.92%
      (p<0.0001) and 75.96% (p<0.0001), respectively. The combination treatment also
      diminished spontaneous and induced lung metastasis. Potential of immunotherapy by
      PNP PDT is multifactorial. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to its potential for
      photodynamic diagnosis and therapy, PNP PDT can synergize immunotherapy in
      treating locally advanced and metastatic bladder cancer. Clinical trials are
      warranted to determine the efficacy and toxicity of this combination.

TI  - Identification of a molecularly-defined subset of breast and ovarian cancer
      models that respond to WEE1 or ATR inhibition, overcoming PARP inhibitor
      resistance.
LID - CCR-22-0568 [pii]
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-22-0568 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: PARP inhibitors (PARPi) induce synthetic lethality in homologous
      recombination repair (HRR) deficient tumors and are used to treat breast,
      ovarian, pancreatic and prostate cancers. Multiple PARPi resistance mechanisms
      exist, most resulting in restoration of HRR and protection of stalled replication
      forks. ATR inhibition was highlighted as a unique approach to reverse both
      aspects of resistance. Recently, however, a PARPi/WEE1 inhibitor combination
      demonstrated enhanced anti-tumor activity associated with the induction of
      replication stress, suggesting another approach to tackling PARPi resistance.
      EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We analyzed breast and ovarian patient-derived xenoimplant
      (PDX) models resistant to PARPi to quantify WEE1i and ATRi responses as single
      agents and in combination with PARPi. Biomarker analysis was conducted at the
      genetic and protein level. Metabolite analysis by mass spectrometry and
      nucleoside rescue experiments ex vivo were also conducted in patient-derived
      models. RESULTS: While WEE1i response was linked to markers of replication
      stress, including STK11/RB1 and phospho-RPA, ATRi response associated with ATM
      mutation. When combined with olaparib, WEE1i could be differentiated from the
      ATRi/olaparib combination, providing distinct therapeutic strategies to overcome 
      PARPi resistance by targeting the replication stress response. Mechanistically,
      WEE1i sensitivity was associated with shortage of the dNTP pool and a concomitant
      increase in replication stress. CONCLUSION: Targeting the replication stress
      response is a valid therapeutic option to overcome PARPi resistance including
      tumors without an underlying HRR deficiency. These preclinical insights are now
      being tested in several clinical trials where the PARPi is administered with
      either the WEE1i or the ATRi.

TI  - Differential requirement of Hippo cascade during CTNNB1 or AXIN1 mutation driven 
      hepatocarcinogenesis.
LID - 10.1002/hep.32693 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Gain-of-function (GOF) mutations of CTNNB1 and
      loss-of-function (LOF) mutations of AXIN1 are recurrent genetic alterations in
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We aim to investigate the functional contribution
      of Hippo/YAP/TAZ in GOF CTNNB1 or LOF AXIN1 mutant HCCs. APPROACH & RESULTS: The 
      requirement of YAP/TAZ in c-Met/beta-Catenin and c-Met/sgAxin1 driven HCC was
      analyzed using conditional Yap, Taz, and Yap;Taz knockout (KO) mice. Mechanisms
      of AXIN1 in regulating YAP/TAZ were investigated using AXIN1 mutated HCC cells.
      Hepatocyte-specific inducible TTR-CreER(T2) KO system was applied to evaluate the
      role of Yap;Taz during tumor progression. Cabozantinib and G007-LK combinational 
      treatment were tested in vitro and in vivo. Nuclear YAP/TAZ was strongly induced 
      in c-Met/sgAxin1 mouse HCC cells. Activation of Hippo via overexpression of Lats2
      or concomitant deletion of Yap and Taz significantly inhibited c-Met/sgAxin1
      driven HCC development, whereas the same approaches had mild effects in
      c-Met/beta-Catenin HCCs. YAP is the major Hippo effector in c-Met/beta-Catenin
      HCCs, and both YAP and TAZ are required for c-Met/sgAxin1 dependent
      hepatocarcinogenesis. Mechanistically, AXIN1 binds to YAP/TAZ in human HCC cells 
      and regulates YAP/TAZ stability. Genetic deletion of YAP/TAZ suppresses already
      formed c-Met/sgAxin1 liver tumors, supporting the requirement of YAP/TAZ during
      tumor progression. Importantly, tankyrase inhibitor G007-LK, which targets Hippo 
      and Wnt pathways, synergizes with cabozantinib, a c-MET inhibitor, leading to
      tumor regression in the c-Met/sgAxin1 HCC model. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies
      demonstrate that YAP/TAZ are major signaling molecules downstream of LOF AXIN1
      mutant HCCs, and targeting YAP/TAZ as an effective treatment against AXIN1 mutant
      human HCCs.

AB  - Fruits of Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck var. Valencia contain hesperidin as a major
      flavanone glycoside. Hesperidin (H) was isolated from the peels of Valencia
      orange and formulated as hexosomal nanodispersions (F1) adopting the hot
      emulsification method. The antimycobacterial activity(anti-TB) was evaluated
      through a microplate Alamar blue (MABA) assay where F1 showed significant
      activity with MIC = 0.19 microM. To unravel the potential mechanism of the
      anti-TB, a molecular docking study of H using the Mycobacterial Dihydrofolate
      reductase (Mtb. DHFR) enzyme was performed. Hesperidin exhibited significant
      interactions with Mtb. DHFR active site. Sulforhodamine B assay was applied to
      evaluate cytotoxic activity against the lung cancer cell line (A-549). F1 showed 
      a cytotoxic effect at IC50= 33 microM. It also has potent antiviral activity

TI  - Protein Design: From the Aspect of Water Solubility and Stability.
LID - 10.1021/acs.chemrev.1c00757 [doi]
AB  - Water solubility and structural stability are key merits for proteins defined by 
      the primary sequence and 3D-conformation. Their manipulation represents important
      aspects of the protein design field that relies on the accurate placement of
      amino acids and molecular interactions, guided by underlying physiochemical
      principles. Emulated designer proteins with well-defined properties both fuel the
      knowledge-base for more precise computational design models and are used in
      various biomedical and nanotechnological applications. The continuous
      developments in protein science, increasing computing power, new algorithms, and 
      characterization techniques provide sophisticated toolkits for solubility design 
      beyond guess work. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the protein
      design field with respect to water solubility and structural stability. After
      introducing fundamental design rules, we discuss the transmembrane protein
      solubilization and de novo transmembrane protein design. Traditional strategies
      to enhance protein solubility and structural stability are introduced. The
      designs of stable protein complexes and high-order assemblies are covered.
      Computational methodologies behind these endeavors, including structure
      prediction programs, machine learning algorithms, and specialty software
      dedicated to the evaluation of protein solubility and aggregation, are discussed.
      The findings and opportunities for Cryo-EM are presented. This review provides an
      overview of significant progress and prospects in accurate protein design for
      solubility and stability.

TI  - Controversies in Selecting Nobel Laureates: An Historical Commentary.
LID - 10.5041/RMMJ.10479 [doi]
AB  - There is universal agreement that the Nobel Prizes, given to individuals who have
      made an extraordinarily notable contribution to humankind in the fields of
      chemistry, physics, physiology or medicine, literature, and peace, are the most
      prestigious prizes offered for human achievement. This commentary gives an
      overview of the basis for Alfred Nobel writing his third will that established
      the five prizes and includes a discussion of why those five fields were chosen.
      The commentary includes factors that influenced his choices and contains examples
      of controversial selections or omissions, especially in the earlier years. A few 
      were errors of omission (e.g. Tolstoy, Tesla, Edison, Best, Gandhi, Franklin),
      some errors of commission (e.g. Fibiger, Moniz); but, given the complexity of the
      task, the error rate is small. In some cases, the conclusion that an error had
      been made is debatable. Such decisions are difficult. Arne Tiselius, a Nobel
      laureate in chemistry and President of the Nobel Foundation said that one cannot 
      in practice apply the principle that the Nobel Prize should be given to the
      person who is best; it is impossible to define who is best. Hence, there is only 
      one alternative: to try to find a particularly worthy candidate. This paper
      includes a brief review of the integration of the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in
      Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, established in 1968, and added to
      the original five Nobel Prizes; the prize was first awarded in 1969. A short
      discussion on the absence of a Nobel Prize in mathematics is provided.
      Adaptations to the development of "big" science, especially in physics, may
      require the Nobel Foundation to extend its limit of no more than three awardees
      for the prize in physics and, perhaps, other scientific disciplines.

TI  - Triple-negative breast cancer metastasis involves complex epithelial-mesenchymal 
      transition dynamics and requires vimentin.
PG  - eabn7571
LID - 10.1126/scitranslmed.abn7571 [doi]
AB  - Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype associated with
      early metastatic recurrence and worse patient outcomes. TNBC tumors express
      molecular markers of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), but its
      requirement during spontaneous TNBC metastasis in vivo remains incompletely
      understood. We demonstrated that spontaneous TNBC tumors from a genetically
      engineered mouse model (GEMM), multiple patient-derived xenografts, and archival 
      patient samples exhibited large populations in vivo of hybrid E/M cells that lead
      invasion ex vivo while expressing both epithelial and mesenchymal
      characteristics. The mesenchymal marker vimentin promoted invasion and repressed 
      metastatic outgrowth. We next tested the requirement for five EMT transcription
      factors and observed distinct patterns of utilization during invasion and colony 
      formation. These differences suggested a sequential activation of multiple EMT
      molecular programs during the metastatic cascade. Consistent with this model, our
      longitudinal single-cell RNA analysis detected three different EMT-related
      molecular patterns. We observed cancer cells progressing from epithelial to
      hybrid E/M and strongly mesenchymal patterns during invasion and from epithelial 
      to a hybrid E/M pattern during colony formation. We next investigated the
      relative epithelial versus mesenchymal state of cancer cells in both GEMM and
      patient metastases. In both contexts, we observed heterogeneity between and
      within metastases in the same individual. We observed a complex spectrum of
      epithelial, hybrid E/M, and mesenchymal cell states within metastases, suggesting
      that there are multiple successful molecular strategies for distant organ
      colonization. Together, our results demonstrate an important and complex role for
      EMT programs during TNBC metastasis.

TI  - Intracavity generation of glioma stem cell-specific CAR macrophages primes
      locoregional immunity for postoperative glioblastoma therapy.
PG  - eabn1128
LID - 10.1126/scitranslmed.abn1128 [doi]
AB  - Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remains incurable despite aggressive implementation
      of multimodal treatments after surgical debulking. Almost all patients with GBM
      relapse within a narrow margin around the initial resected lesion due to
      postsurgery residual glioma stem cells (GSCs). Tracking and eradicating
      postsurgery residual GSCs is critical for preventing postoperative relapse of
      this devastating disease, yet effective strategies remain elusive. Here, we
      report a cavity-injectable nanoporter-hydrogel superstructure that creates
      GSC-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) macrophages/microglia (MPhis)
      surrounding the cavity to prevent GBM relapse. Specifically, we demonstrate that 
      the CAR gene-laden nanoporter in the hydrogel can introduce GSC-targeted CAR
      genes into MPhi nuclei after intracavity delivery to generate CAR-MPhis in mouse 
      models of GBM. These CAR-MPhis were able to seek and engulf GSCs and clear
      residual GSCs by stimulating an adaptive antitumor immune response in the tumor
      microenvironment and prevented postoperative glioma relapse by inducing long-term
      antitumor immunity in mice. In an orthotopic patient-derived glioblastoma
      humanized mouse model, the combined treatment with nanoporter-hydrogel
      superstructure and CD47 antibody increased the frequency of positive immune
      responding cells and suppressed the negative immune regulating cells, conferring 
      a robust tumoricidal immunity surrounding the postsurgical cavity and inhibiting 
      postoperative glioblastoma relapse. Therefore, our work establishes a
      locoregional treatment strategy for priming cancer stem cell-specific tumoricidal
      immunity with broad application in patients suffering from recurrent
      malignancies.

TI  - Molecular mechanism for strengthening E-cadherin adhesion using a monoclonal
      antibody.
PG  - e2204473119
LID - 10.1073/pnas.2204473119 [doi]
AB  - E-cadherin (Ecad) is an essential cell-cell adhesion protein with tumor
      suppression properties. The adhesive state of Ecad can be modified by the
      monoclonal antibody 19A11, which has potential applications in reducing cancer
      metastasis. Using X-ray crystallography, we determine the structure of 19A11 Fab 
      bound to Ecad and show that the antibody binds to the first extracellular domain 
      of Ecad near its primary adhesive motif: the strand-swap dimer interface.
      Molecular dynamics simulations and single-molecule atomic force microscopy
      demonstrate that 19A11 interacts with Ecad in two distinct modes: one that
      strengthens the strand-swap dimer and one that does not alter adhesion. We show
      that adhesion is strengthened by the formation of a salt bridge between 19A11 and
      Ecad, which in turn stabilizes the swapped beta-strand and its complementary
      binding pocket. Our results identify mechanistic principles for engineering
      antibodies to enhance Ecad adhesion.

TI  - Gammaherpesvirus-mediated repression reveals EWSR1 to be a negative regulator of 
      B cell responses.
PG  - e2123362119
LID - 10.1073/pnas.2123362119 [doi]
AB  - The germinal center (GC) plays a central role in the generation of
      antigen-specific B cells and antibodies. Tight regulation of the GC is essential 
      due to the inherent risks of tumorigenesis and autoimmunity posed by
      inappropriate GC B cell processes. Gammaherpesviruses such as Epstein-Barr virus 
      (EBV) and murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) utilize numerous armaments to drive 
      infected naive B cells, independent of antigen, through GC reactions to expand
      the latently infected B cell population and establish a stable latency reservoir.
      We previously demonstrated that the MHV68 microRNA (miRNA) mghv-miR-M1-7-5p
      represses host EWSR1 (Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1) to promote B cell
      infection. EWSR1 is a transcription and splicing regulator that is recognized for
      its involvement as a fusion protein in Ewing sarcoma. A function for EWSR1 in B
      cell responses has not been previously reported. Here, we demonstrate that 1) B
      cell-specific deletion of EWSR1 had no effect on generation of mature B cell
      subsets or basal immunoglobulin levels in naive mice, 2) repression or ablation
      of EWSR1 in B cells promoted expansion of MHV68 latently infected GC B cells, and
      3) B cell-specific deletion of EWSR1 during a normal immune response to nonviral 
      antigen resulted in significantly elevated numbers of antigen-specific GC B
      cells, plasma cells, and circulating antibodies. Notably, EWSR1 deficiency did
      not affect the proliferation or survival of GC B cells but instead resulted in
      the generation of increased numbers of precursor GC B cells. Cumulatively, these 
      findings demonstrate that EWSR1 is a negative regulator of B cell responses.

TI  - New Cancer-Related Symptoms Predict Recurrence in CA19-9 Non-Expressers After
      Resection of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.
PG  - 31348221117031
LID - 10.1177/00031348221117031 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: CA19-9 elevation has been reported to predict recurrence after
      resection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), although only two-thirds of
      patients are expressers. Preoperatively, cancer-related symptoms predict outcome;
      however, it is unknown whether symptoms predict recurrence during surveillance,
      particularly for CA19-9 non-expressers. METHODS: Patients undergoing resection of
      PDAC at our institution from 2012 to 21 (n = 165) were retrospectively reviewed
      for CA19-9 and symptoms, which were correlated with recurrence-free survival
      (RFS). Multivariate analysis was performed using Cox regression. RESULTS: During 
      postoperative surveillance, CA19-9 elevation and development of symptoms
      (abdominal pain, weight loss, or jaundice) were associated with worse RFS (P <
      .05). Multivariate analysis showed that both symptoms and CA19-9 were
      independently predictive of RFS (HR 1.8 [1.1-2.9; P = .025] and 2.5 [1.0-6.0; P =
      .048]). Among CA19-9 non-expressers (n = 51), development of symptoms was
      associated with detection of recurrence (P = .012). CONCLUSIONS: Among CA19-9
      non-expressers, development of symptoms predicted recurrence, providing a useful 
      tool for recurrence detection in these patients.

TI  - Metallo-alginate hydrogel can potentiate microwave tumor ablation for synergistic
      cancer treatment.
PG  - eabo5285
LID - 10.1126/sciadv.abo5285 [doi]
AB  - Microwave ablation (MWA) as a local tumor ablation strategy suffers from
      posttreatment tumor recurrence. Development of adjuvant biomaterials to
      potentiate MWA is therefore of practical significance. Here, the high
      concentration of Ca(2+) fixed by alginate as Ca(2+)-surplus alginate hydrogel
      shows enhanced heating efficiency and restricted heating zone under microwave
      exposure. The high concentration of extracellular Ca(2+) synergizes with mild
      hyperthermia to induce immunogenic cell death by disrupting intracellular Ca(2+) 
      homeostasis. Resultantly, Ca(2+)-surplus alginate hydrogel plus MWA can ablate
      different tumors on both mice and rabbits at reduced operation powers. This
      treatment can also elicit antitumor immunity, especially if synergized with
      Mn(2+), an activator of the stimulation of interferon genes pathway, to suppress 
      the growth of both untreated distant tumors and rechallenged tumors. This work
      highlights that in situ-formed metallo-alginate hydrogel could act as
      microwave-susceptible and immunostimulatory biomaterial to reinforce the MWA
      therapy, promising for clinical translation.

TI  - Transcriptional variability accelerates preleukemia by cell diversification and
      perturbation of protein synthesis.
PG  - eabn4886
LID - 10.1126/sciadv.abn4886 [doi]
AB  - Transcriptional variability facilitates stochastic cell diversification and can
      in turn underpin adaptation to stress or injury. We hypothesize that it may
      analogously facilitate progression of premalignancy to cancer. To investigate
      this, we initiated preleukemia in mouse cells with enhanced transcriptional
      variability due to conditional disruption of the histone lysine acetyltransferase
      gene Kat2a. By combining single-cell RNA sequencing of preleukemia with
      functional analysis of transformation, we show that Kat2a loss results in global 
      variegation of cell identity and accumulation of preleukemic cells. Leukemia
      progression is subsequently facilitated by destabilization of ribosome biogenesis
      and protein synthesis, which confer a transient transformation advantage. The
      contribution of transcriptional variability to early cancer evolution reflects a 
      generic role in promoting cell fate transitions, which, in the case of
      well-adapted malignancies, contrastingly differentiates and depletes cancer stem 
      cells. That is, transcriptional variability confers forward momentum to cell fate
      systems, with differential multistage impact throughout cancer evolution.

TI  - KCTD7 mutations impair the trafficking of lysosomal enzymes through CLN5
      accumulation to cause neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses.
PG  - eabm5578
LID - 10.1126/sciadv.abm5578 [doi]
AB  - Lysosomes are central organelles for cellular degradation and energy metabolism. 
      Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are a group of the most common
      neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorders characterized by intracellular
      accumulation of ceroid in neurons. Mutations in KCTD7, a gene encoding an adaptor
      of the CUL3-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL3) complex, are categorized as a unique 
      NCL subtype. However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we report
      various lysosomal and autophagic defects in KCTD7-deficient cells.
      Mechanistically, the CRL3-KCTD7 complex degrades CLN5, whereas patient-derived
      KCTD7 mutations disrupt the interaction between KCTD7-CUL3 or KCTD7-CLN5 and
      ultimately lead to excessive accumulation of CLN5. The accumulated CLN5 disrupts 
      the interaction between CLN6/8 and lysosomal enzymes at the endoplasmic reticulum
      (ER), subsequently impairing ER-to-Golgi trafficking of lysosomal enzymes. Our
      findings reveal previously unrecognized roles of KCTD7-mediated CLN5 proteolysis 
      in lysosomal homeostasis and demonstrate that KCTD7 and CLN5 are biochemically
      linked and function in a common neurodegenerative pathway.

      program and restrains tumor development.
PG  - eabn3986
LID - 10.1126/sciadv.abn3986 [doi]
AB  - Current therapies remain unsatisfactory in preventing the recurrence of
      glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), which leads to poor patient survival. By rational 
      engineering of the transcription factor SOX2, a key promoter of GBM malignancy,
      together with the Kruppel-associated box and DNA methyltransferase3A/L catalytic 
      domains, we generated a synthetic repressor named SOX2 epigenetic silencer (SES),
      which induces the transcriptional silencing of its original targets. By doing so,
      SES kills both glioma cell lines and patient-derived cancer stem cells in vitro
      and in vivo. SES expression, through local viral delivery in mouse xenografts,
      induces strong regression of human tumors and survival rescue. Conversely, SES is
      not harmful to neurons and glia, also thanks to a minimal promoter that restricts
      its expression in mitotically active cells, rarely present in the brain
      parenchyma. Collectively, SES produces a significant silencing of a large
      fraction of the SOX2 transcriptional network, achieving high levels of efficacy
      in repressing aggressive brain tumors.

AB  - Cancer is a predominant disease across animals. We applied a comparative genomics
      approach to systematically characterize genes whose conservation levels correlate
      positively (PC) or negatively (NC) with cancer resistance estimates across 193
      vertebrates. Pathway analysis reveals that NC genes are enriched for metabolic
      functions and PC genes in cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, and immune response,
      pointing to their corresponding roles in mediating cancer risk. We find that PC
      genes are less tolerant to loss-of-function (LoF) mutations, are enriched in
      cancer driver genes, and are associated with germline mutations that increase
      human cancer risk. Their relevance to cancer risk is further supported via the
      analysis of mouse functional genomics and cancer mortality of zoo mammals' data. 
      In sum, our study describes a cross-species genomic analysis pointing to
      candidate genes that may mediate human cancer risk.

AB  - The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is frequently co-opted by cancer
      cells to enhance migratory and invasive cell traits. It is a key contributor to
      heterogeneity, chemoresistance, and metastasis in many carcinoma types, where the

      spanning the EMT spectrum having diverse migratory, tumor-initiating, and
      metastatic qualities, including three unique intermediates. Using a multiomics
      approach, we identify CBFbeta as a key regulator of metastatic ability in the
      intermediate state. To quantify epithelial-mesenchymal heterogeneity within
      tumors, we develop an advanced multiplexed immunostaining approach using
      SUM149-derived orthotopic tumors and find that the EMT state and
      epithelial-mesenchymal heterogeneity are predictive of overall survival in a
      cohort of stage III breast cancer. Our model reveals previously unidentified
      insights into the complex EMT spectrum and its regulatory networks, as well as
      the contributions of epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity (EMP) in tumor
      heterogeneity in breast cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer is usually detected at later stages and no effective
      screening approach, has been identified. Therefore, sensitive and specific
      biomarkers for detecting ovarian cancer are urgently needed. OBJECTIVE: This
      study aimed to investigate the efficacy of six biomarkers for the early clinical 
      diagnosis of ovarian cancer. SUBJECTS & METHODS: The study included 120 patients 
      (benign ovarian tumors and early and late ovarian carcinoma) and 30 control
      healthy volunteers. MiRNA-204, CA125, CA19.9, hepcidin, microfibril-associated
      glycoprotein 2, and ferroportin levels were determined in all patients and
      control volunteers. RESULTS: The combined area under the receiver operating
      characteristic curves for miRNA-204, CA125, and CA19.9 were 0.938, 1.000, and
      0.998 for benign tumors and early and late ovarian carcinomas, respectively. The 
      sensitivities of miRNA-204, CA125, and CA19.9 were 98.04%, 100.00%, and 96.19%
      and the specificities were 58.33%, 62.50%, and 57.78%, respectively. CONCLUSION: 
      The positive predictivity of miRNA-204, CA125, and CA19.9 for ovarian cancer is
      high (59.57%, 58.24%, and 61.67%, respectively). Thus, the combination of these
      three biomarkers is a good diagnostic tool for ovarian cancer.

PG  - e0270487
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0270487 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Color vision deficiency describes the inability to distinguish
      certain shades of color. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of having
      color vision deficiency on the accuracy of distinguishing benign and malignant
      skin lesions by naked-eye examination. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study 
      conducted during the period August 2020 to February 2021. We randomly selected a 
      total of 20 nevi and 20 melanoma images from an open access image database. The
      40 images were divided into four sets of images, each set contained 5 benign and 
      5 malignant skin lesion images simulated as if they were seen by a protanope
      physician, deuteranope physician, tritanope physician, and a set of images
      presented without simulation. In an online survey, students who were in their
      final year of medical school or had newly graduated were asked to diagnose each
      image as benign or malignant. RESULTS: A total of 140 participants were included 
      with a mean (SD) age of 24.88 (1.51). We found a significantly higher mean
      accuracy for non-simulated images compared to deuteranope simulated images (p<
      0.001, mean difference = 11.07, 95% CI 8.40 to 13.74). We did not find a
      significant difference in accuracy classification for protanope simulated images 
      (p = 0.066), nor for tritanope simulated images (p = 0.315). Classification
      accuracy for malignant lesions was higher than classification accuracy for benign
      lesions, with the highest difference belonging to deuteranope simulated images,
      with a difference in mean accuracy of classifying malignant lesions by 32.2 (95% 
      CI 27.0 to 37.6). CONCLUSION: Deuteranope participants (i.e., green color
      deficiency) had a significantly lower accuracy of distinguishing pigmented skin
      lesions as benign or malignant, an impact not found for other color vision
      deficiencies, which was mainly for misdiagnosing benign lesions as malignant.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272337 [doi]
AB  - To determine and evaluate the benefits of aquatic physical therapy as a
      rehabilitation strategy for women with breast cancer on health outcomes.
      Electronic databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library
      and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Weipu (VIP) and Wanfang
      database were systematically searched until June 2021. Randomized controlled
      trials were included if they evaluated the effects of aquatic physical therapy in
      breast cancer patients. The quality of the trials included was assessed by the
      two independent researchers according to the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook
      recommendations. Outcome measures were fatigue, waist circumference and quality
      of life (QoL). The study was registered under PROSPERO (CRD42021157323). Totally,
      five studies comprising 356 participants were included in the study.
      Meta-analyses showed that aquatic physical therapy interventions significantly
      reduced the fatigue score (MD = -2.14, 95%CI: -2.82, -1.45, p<0.01) compared with
      usual care; In addition, we also observed that, compared with land-based
      exercise, aquatic physical therapy greatly improved the QoL (MD = 2.85, 95%CI:
      0.62, 5.09, p = 0.01). However, aquatic physical therapy cannot improve physical 
      index (waist circumference) compared to usual care (MD = -3.49, 95%CI:
      -11.56,4.58, p = 0.4). Consequently, aquatic physical therapy had a positive
      effect on the fatigue and QoL. The results of this meta-analysis can provide a
      reliable evidence for evaluating the interventional effectiveness of aquatic
      physical therapy.

      mortality in a cohort of men and women free of diabetes at baseline.
PG  - e0272437
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272437 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The association between insulin resistance and cancer-mortality is
      not fully explored. We investigated the association between several insulin
      sensitivity indices (ISIs) and cancer-mortality over 3.5 decades in a cohort of
      adult men and women. We hypothesized that higher insulin resistance will be
      associated with greater cancer-mortality risk. METHODS: A cohort of 1,612 men and
      women free of diabetes during baseline were followed since 1979 through 2016
      according to level of insulin resistance (IR) for cause specific mortality, as
      part of the Israel study on Glucose Intolerance, Obesity and Hypertension (GOH). 
      IR was defined according to the Mcauley index (MCAi), calculated by fasting
      insulin and triglycerides, the Homeostatic Model Assessment (HOMA), the Matsuda
      Insulin Sensitivity Index (MISI), and the Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check 
      Index (QUICKI), calculated by plasma glucose and insulin. RESULTS: Mean age at
      baseline was 51.5 +/- 8.0 years, 804 (49.9%) were males and 871 (54.0%) had
      prediabetes. Mean follow-up was 36.7+/-0.2 years and 47,191 person years were
      accrued. Cox proportional hazard model and competing risks analysis adjusted for 
      age, sex, country of origin, BMI, blood pressure, total cholesterol, smoking and 
      glycemic status, revealed an increased risk for cancer-mortality, HR = 1.5 (95%
      CI: 1.1-2.0, p = 0.005) for the MCAi Q1 compared with Q2-4. No statistically
      significant associations were observed between the other ISIs and
      cancer-mortality. CONCLUSION: The MCAi was independently associated with an
      increased risk for cancer-mortality in adult men and women free of diabetes and
      should be further studied as an early biomarker for cancer risk.

TI  - Partner-Specific Drug Repositioning Approach Based on Graph Convolutional
      Network.
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2022.3194891 [doi]
AB  - Drug repositioning identifies novel therapeutic potentials for existing drugs and
      is considered an attractive approach due to the opportunity for reduced
      development timelines and overall costs. Prior computational methods usually
      learned a drug's representation from an entire graph of drug-disease
      associations. Therefore, the representation of learned drugs representation are
      static and agnostic to various diseases. However, for different diseases, a
      drug's mechanism of actions (MoAs) are different. The relevant context
      information should be differentiated for the same drug to target different
      diseases. Computational methods are thus required to learn different
      representations corresponding to different drug-disease associations for the
      given drug. In view of this, we propose an end-to-end partner-specific drug
      repositioning approach based on graph convolutional network, named PSGCN. PSGCN
      firstly extracts specific context information around drug-disease pairs from an
      entire graph of drug-disease associations. Then, it implements a graph
      convolutional network on the extracted graph to learn partner-specific graph
      representation. As the different layers of graph convolutional network contribute
      differently to the representation of the partner-specific graph, we design a
      layer self-attention mechanism to capture multi-scale layer information. Finally,
      PSGCN utilizes sortpool strategy to obtain the partner-specific graph embedding
      and formulates a drug-disease association prediction as a graph classification
      task. A fully-connected module is established to classify the partner-specific
      graph representations. The experiments on three benchmark datasets prove that the
      representation learning of partner-specific graph can lead to superior
      performances over state-of-the-art methods. In particular, case studies on small 
      cell lung cancer and breast carcinoma confirmed that PSGCN is able to retrieve
      more actual drug-disease associations in the top prediction results. Moreover, in
      comparison with other static approaches, PSGCN can partly distinguish the
      different disease context information for the given drug.

AB  - Ovarian cancer (OC) is a lethal gynecological malignancy with a five-year
      survival rate of only 46%. Development of resistance to platinum-based
      chemotherapy is a common cause of high mortality rates among OC patients. Tumor
      and transcriptomic heterogeneity are drivers of platinum resistance in OC.
      Platinum-based chemotherapy enriches for ovarian cancer stem cells (OCSCs) that
      are chemoresistant and contribute to disease recurrence and relapse. Studies
      examining the effect of different treatments on subpopulations of HGSOC cell
      lines are limited. Having previously demonstrated that combined treatment with an
      enhancer of zeste homolog 2 inhibitor (EZH2i) and a RAC1 GTPase inhibitor (RAC1i)
      inhibited survival of OCSCs, we investigated EZH2i and RAC1i combination effects 
      on HGSOC heterogeneity using single cell RNA sequencing. We demonstrated that
      RAC1i reduced expression of stemness and early secretory marker genes, increased 
      expression of an intermediate secretory marker gene and induced inflammatory gene
      expression. Importantly, RAC1i alone and in combination with EZH2i significantly 
      reduced oxidative phosphorylation and upregulated Sirtuin signaling pathways.
      Altogether, we demonstrated that combining a RAC1i with an EZH2i promoted
      differentiation of subpopulations of HGSOC cells, supporting the future
      development of epigenetic drug combinations as therapeutic approaches in OC.

TI  - Global Burden of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, 1990 to 2019: Findings From
      the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019.
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0000000000001739 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the leading cause of
      chronic liver diseases worldwide. We provided a comprehensive description
      regarding the disease burden of NAFLD in 204 countries and territories. MATERIALS
      AND METHODS: We reported the deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs)
      related to NAFLD in the Global Burden of Disease database by sex, age, specific
      causes, and regions. Estimated annual percentage change was applied to describe
      the changing trends. RESULTS: Globally, the NAFLD-related deaths and DALYs in
      2019 were 0.17 million [95% uncertainty interval (UI): 0.13 to 0.21] and 4.42
      million (95% UI: 3.35 to 5.67), increased by 80.2% and 62.9% compared with 1990, 
      respectively. The overall age-standardized rate of mortality and DALYs (ASMR and 
      ASDR) showed a downward trend from 1990 to 2019, the estimated annual percentage 
      change were -0.67 (95% confidence interval: -0.76, -0.57) and -0.82 (95%
      confidence interval: -0.93, -0.7), respectively. NAFLD-related deaths due to
      cirrhosis and liver cancer increased by 76.7% and 95.1% between 1990 and 2019.
      The ASMR and ASDR were the highest in the middle and low sociodemographical index
      regions in 2019, respectively. Of the 21 Global Burden of Disease regions,
      Eastern Europe, Central Asia, High-income North America, and Australasia
      experienced an increase in both ASMR and ASDR. CONCLUSIONS: NAFLD imposes heavy
      disease burden on humankind worldwide, especially in countries with low-to-middle
      sociodemographical index level. More potent measures are urgently needed in
      regions with rising age-standardized rate to forestall the increase of NAFLD
      disease burden.

AB  - Exosome DNA (exoDNA) can be used for liquid biopsy. This study was the first to
      use droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) to detect tumor-specific mutations in exoDNA and 
      to evaluate the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. 60 HCC
      patients were enrolled in the study. We used ddPCR to detect c.747 G > T mutation
      in TP53 gene. We analyzed the correlation between detectable mutation in exoDNA
      and clinicopathologic characteristics using Multivariate logistics regression
      analysis. We performed Cox regression to assess the correlation between mutation 
      frequency (mutant droplets/total droplets, MD/TD) and prognostic. We found that
      48 of 60 patients had c.747 G > T mutation in TP53 gene in exoDNA (80.0%). We
      found that detectable mutation in exoDNA and age were associated with
      microvascular invasion (MVI) (P < .01). The ROC curve analysis revealed that the 
      best cutoff value of mutation frequency to predict MVI was 67% (sensitivity
      48.15%, specificity 93.94%,), the corresponding AUC was 0.761 (95%CI,
      0.640-0.866; P < .01). Furthermore, we found that patients suffered
      high-frequency mutation (>67%) had shorted median recurrence-free survival (RFS) 
      with 63 days (range, 53-202 days), compared with 368 days (range, 51-576 days)
      for patients with low-frequency mutation (<67%) (HR:4.61; 95% CI, 1.70-12.48; P =
      0 .003). We also found that high-frequency mutation was associated with poor
      prognosis though patients had better pathological characteristics, such as AFP
      (<400 ng/mL), Liver cirrhosis (Negative), Tumor thrombus (Negative), Tumor
      numbers (Single) and Post-operation TACE (Executed). We provided evidence that
      the mutations in exoDNA might be used to predict patients with poor
      RFS.Abbreviations: TP53: Tumor protein p53; ExoDNA: Exosomal DNA; HCC:

TI  - Real-world outcomes of molecular targeted agents for patients with hepatocellular
      carcinoma over 80 years old.
LID - 10.1111/hepr.13818 [doi]
AB  - AIM: There is insufficient evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of
      molecular targeted agents (MTAs) for elderly patients with hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC), who are likely to be vulnerable to adverse events (AEs) of
      therapy. The aim of this study was to compare sorafenib and lenvatinib use in
      elderly patients with HCC from the viewpoint of overall survival (OS) and rate of
      AE-induced MTA discontinuation. METHODS: This retrospective study included
      patients with HCC over 80 years old who received first-ine molecular targeted
      therapy (MTT) at four hospitals between June 2009 and September 2019. They were
      divided into three groups according to the era and type of first-line MTA:
      E1-Sora (sorafenib, between 2009 and 2016), E2-Sora (sorafenib, between 2017 and 
      2019), and E2-Len (lenvatinib, between 2017 and 2019). RESULTS: The study
      included 173 patients (E1-Sora: n=79, E2-Sora: n=50, E2-Len: n=44) with a median 
      age of 81.9 years (range 80-93). Median OS was 15.1 months in the entire cohort
      (E1-Sora, 12.7 months; E2-Sora, 20.5 months; E2-Len, 10.3 months). The rate of
      treatment discontinuation due to AEs was high in the entire cohort, especially in
      E1-Sora and E2-Len (49.4% in E1-Sora, 28.0% in E2-Sora, and 54.6% in E2-Len,
      p=0.0753). More E2-Sora patients received subsequent MTT than E2-Len patients
      (E2-Sora, 50%; E2-Len, 28.6%; p=0.0111). CONCLUSION: Both sorafenib and
      lenvatinib were effective and feasible for elderly patients with HCC. In terms of
      discontinuation due to AEs and subsequent MTT, sorafenib might be more desirable 
      for old patients with HCC over 80 years. This article is protected by copyright.

TI  - Tumor Suppressor Genes are Reactivated by miR-26A1 via Enhancer Reprogramming in 
      NSCLC.

AB  - Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the most malignant epithelial
      tumors. Studies have suggested that DNA hypermethylation of promoters and
      abnormal histone modifications could induce tumor suppressor genes (TSGs)
      downregulation in NSCLC. However, the exact mechanism of TSGs downregulation
      remains unclear. In this study, we found that there is no difference in the
      regions of most TSGs promoters in NSCLC. Moreover, we found that there is no
      methylation difference in the region of VILL promoter in NSCLC compared with
      adjacent tissue samples by pyrosequencing. We further demonstrated that VILL was 
      markedly reactivated in A549 and H1703 cells infected with miR-26A1 lentivirus
      while this activation was inhibited by JQ1, an enhancer inhibitor. In addition,
      we identified that miR-26A1 could function as a tumor suppressor to inhibit
      proliferation and metastasis of NSCLC cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays
      revealed that transfection of miR-26A1 could significantly induce the enrichment 
      of H3K27ac at the enhancer regions in A549 cells. To sum up, our findings
      revealed that enhancer-mediated TSGs regulation in NSCLC, suggesting that
      miR-26A1 could serve as a key regulator and may be a potential therapeutic target
      for NSCLC.

TI  - Variations in oral microbiome and its predictive functions between tumorous and
      healthy individuals.
LID - 10.1099/jmm.0.001568 [doi]
AB  - Introduction. The oral cavity is one of the largest reservoirs of microorganisms 
      and many pathogenic bacteria have been shown to be associated with the aetiology 
      of oral cancers.Gap Statement. Owing to the complexity of oral microbial
      communities and their unclear relationship with oral cancer, identification of
      specific bacteria which contribute to oral cancer is a key imperative.Aim. To
      compare and investigate the variations in the composition of the bacterial
      microbiome and its functions between patients with oral tumorous lesions and
      healthy subjects.Methodology. Twenty-seven samples from individuals with oral
      tumours (five oral benign tumours and 22 oral squamous cell carcinomas) and 15
      samples from healthy subjects were collected. Genomic DNA was extracted and the
      V3-V5 region of the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced. Subsequently, bioinformatic
      assessment was conducted using QIIME2, PICRUSt and linear discriminant analysis
      effect size analyses (LEfSe).Results. The oral microbiota was composed mainly of 
      the phyla Proteobacteria (31.76 %, 35.00 %), Bacteroidetes (30.13 %, 25.13 %) and
      Firmicutes (23.92 %, 17.07 %) in tumorous and healthy individuals, respectively. 
      Neisseria, Prevotella, Fusobacterium, Streptococcus, Capnocytophaga, Veillonella,
      Haemophilus, Prevotella, Porphyromonas and Leptotrichia were the most abundant
      genera. Alpha diversity in the tumour group was significantly greater than that
      in the healthy group (P<0.05). Differential analysis of microbes between groups
      demonstrated a significantly higher number of Neisseria, Veillonella,
      Streptococcus, Leptotrichia, Lautropia, Sphingopyxis, Sphingobium, Tannerella,
      Actinomyces and Rothia in healthy controls compared with the tumour group.
      However, the genera Treponema, Micrococcus, Pseudomonas, Janthinobacterium,
      Parvimos, Loktanella, Staphylococcus, Acinetobacter, Catonella, Aggregatibacter
      and Propionibacterium were significantly higher in the tumour group. Pathways
      related to cancers, cell motility, environmental adaptation, metabolism and
      signal transduction were enhanced in the tumour group, while functions associated
      with immune system diseases, replication, repair and translation were
      significantly enhanced in the healthy group.Conclusion. Variations in the oral
      microbiota and its functions showed a correlation with oral tumours. The tumour
      group showed an increased abundance of some multi-drug-resistant and
      periodontitis-related pathogens. The significantly altered microbiotas may serve 
      as potential biomarkers or inform combination therapy for oral tumours.

TI  - Prognostic impact of the tumor volume doubling time in clinical T1 non-small cell
      lung cancer with solid radiological findings.
LID - 10.1002/jso.27043 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to investigate better radiological
      prognostic factors in clinical T1 pure-solid non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 
      METHODS: This study enrolled 284 patients with clinical T1 solid NSCLC who
      underwent anatomical lung resection. The Cox proportional hazard model was used
      to evaluate the prognostic impact of tumor volume doubling time (VDT) at
      disease-free survival (DFS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS). RESULTS: The
      median VDT was 347 days. Age (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.04; 95% confidence interval
      (CI), 1.01-1.07) and standardized uptake value max (SUVmax) (>6.0) (HR = 2.61;
      95% CI, 1.52-4.66) were identified as significantly independent worse prognostic 
      factors for DFS in a multivariable analysis without VDT. Furthermore, a
      multivariable analysis without SUVmax identified age (HR = 1.06; 95% CI,
      1.03-1.09), CEA (>5.0 ng/ml) (HR = 2.34; 95% CI, 1.30-4.02), tumor diameter on CT
      (>2.0 cm) (HR = 1.91; 95% CI, 1.18-3.13), and VDT (HR = 4.03; 95% CI, 2.41-6.93) 
      as significantly independent worse prognostic factors for DFS. CONCLUSIONS: The
      VDT value could be a useful prognostic factor in clinical T1 solid NSCLC.

TI  - A Nurse-Led mHealth Self-Management Program (mChemotherapy) for Breast Cancer
      Patients Undergoing Chemotherapy: Study Protocol of a Randomized Controlled Pilot
      Study.
PG  - 10732748221115469
LID - 10.1177/10732748221115469 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The global pandemic has caused breast cancer (BC) patients who are
      receiving chemotherapy to face more challenges in taking care of themselves than 
      usual. A novel nurse-led mHealth program (mChemotherapy) is designed to foster
      self-management for this population. The aim of the pilot study is to determine
      the feasibility, usability, and acceptability of an mChemotherapy program for
      breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. The objective also is to evaluate
      the preliminary effects of this program on adherence to app usage, self-efficacy,
      quality of life, symptom burden, and healthcare utilization among this group of
      patients. METHODS: This is a single-blinded randomized controlled pilot study
      that includes one intervention group (mChemotherapy group) and one control group 
      (routine care group). Ninety-four breast cancer patients who commence
      chemotherapy in a university-affiliated hospital will be recruited. Based on the 
      Individual and Family Self-management Theory, this 6-week mChemotherapy program, 
      which includes a combination of self-regulation activities and nurse-led support,
      will be provided. Data collection will be conducted at baseline, week 3 (T1), and
      week 6 (T2). A general linear model will be utilized for identifying the
      between-group, within-group, and interaction effects. Qualitative content
      analysis will be adopted to analyze, extract, and categorize the interview
      transcripts. DISCUSSIONS: Breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy are a
      population that often experiences a heavy symptom burden. During the pandemic,
      they have had difficulties in self-managing the side effects of chemotherapy due 
      to the lack of face-to-face professional support. An mChemotherapy program will
      be adopted through a self-regulation process and with the provision of nurse-led 
      real-time professional support for these patients. If proven effective, BC
      patients who engage in this program will be more likely to take an active role in
      managing their symptoms, take responsibility for their own health, and
      subsequently improve their self-efficacy and adherence to the use of the app.

TI  - Coronin2A links actin-based endosomal processes to the EHD1 fission machinery.
PG  - mbcE21120624
LID - 10.1091/mbc.E21-12-0624 [doi]
AB  - Fission of transport vesicles from endosomes is a crucial step in the recycling
      of lipids and receptors to the plasma membrane, but this process remains poorly
      understood. Although key components of the fission machinery, including the actin
      cytoskeleton and the ATPase Eps15 Homology Domain Protein 1 (EHD1) have been
      implicated in endosomal fission, how this process is coordinately regulated is
      not known. We have identified the actin regulatory protein Coronin2A (CORO2A) as 
      a novel EHD1 interaction partner. CORO2A localizes to stress fibers and actin
      microfilaments, but also can be observed in partial overlap with EHD1 on
      endosomal structures. siRNA knockdown of CORO2A led to enlarged lamellae-like
      actin-rich protrusions, consistent with a role of other Coronin-family proteins
      in attenuating actin-branching. Moreover, CORO2A depletion also caused a marked
      decrease in the internalization of clathrin-dependent cargo, but had little
      impact on the uptake of clathrin-independent cargo, highlighting key differences 
      in the role of branched actin for different modes of endocytosis. However, CORO2A
      was required for recycling of clathrin-independent cargo, and its depletion led
      to enlarged endosomes, supporting a role for CORO2A in the fission of endosomal
      vesicles. Our data support a novel role for CORO2A in coordinating endosomal
      fission and recycling with EHD1. [Media: see text] [Media: see text].

TI  - alpha-catenin Dependent Vinculin Recruitment to Adherens Junctions is
      Antagonistic to Focal Adhesions.
PG  - mbcE22020071
LID - 10.1091/mbc.E22-02-0071 [doi]
AB  - Vinculin is a protein found in both focal adhesions (FAs) and adherens junctions 
      (AJs) which regulates actin connectivity to these structures. Many studies have
      demonstrated that mechanical perturbations of cells result in enhanced
      recruitment of vinculin to FAs and/or AJs. Likewise, many other studies have
      shown "crosstalk" between FAs and AJs. Vinculin itself has been suggested to be a
      probable regulator of this adhesion crosstalk. In this study we used MDCK as a
      model system of epithelia, developing cell lines in which vinculin recruitment
      was reduced or enhanced at AJs. Careful analysis of these cells revealed that
      perturbing vinculin recruitment to AJs resulted in a reduction of detectable FAs.
      Interestingly the crosstalk between these two structures was not due to a limited
      pool of vinculin, as increasing expression of vinculin did not rescue FA
      formation. Instead, we demonstrate that vinculin translocation between AJs and
      FAs is necessary for actin cytoskeleton rearrangements that occur during cell
      migration, which is necessary for large, well-formed FAs. Lastly, we show using a
      wound assay that collective cell migration is similarly hindered when vinculin
      recruitment is reduced or enhanced at AJs, highlighting that vinculin
      translocation between each compartment is necessary for efficient collective
      migration. [Media: see text] [Media: see text] [Media: see text].

TI  - Development of a Self-management and Peer-Mentoring Intervention to Improve
      Transition Readiness Among Young Adult Survivors of Pediatric Cancer: Formative
      Qualitative Research Study.
PG  - e36323
LID - 10.2196/36323 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Childhood cancer survivors require lifelong risk-based follow-up
      care. It should be noted that less than one-third of adult survivors of childhood
      cancer report any survivor-focused care, and fewer than 1 in 5 obtain risk-based 
      follow-up care. It is thought that this may be due to inadequate transition
      readiness, including low levels of knowledge, skills, motivation, and resources
      to make the transition to independent self-management of follow-up care.
      Interventions that focus specifically on improving the transition from
      parent-managed to self-managed care are needed. Theory and prior research suggest
      that targeting self-management skills and using peer mentoring may be innovative 
      strategies to improve transition readiness. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to
      identify the content of a self-management intervention to improve transition
      readiness among adolescent and young adult (AYA) survivors. METHODS: Intervention
      development occurred in 3 stages: formative research with AYA survivors to
      identify barriers and facilitators to obtaining risk-based survivorship care,
      content development using feedback from multiple stakeholders (AYA survivors,
      parents, and providers), and content refinement (usability testing) of the
      initial proposed educational modules for the program. Content analysis, guided by
      the social-ecological model of AYA readiness for transition, was used to identify
      themes and develop and refine the content for the intervention. RESULTS: A total 
      of 19 AYA survivors participated in the formative research stage, and 10 AYA
      survivors, parents, and health care providers participated in the content
      development and refinement stages. The major barrier and facilitator themes
      identified included knowledge of cancer history and risks; relationships with
      health care providers; relationships with family members involved in care;
      emotions about health, follow-up care, and transfer of care; and lifestyle
      behaviors and life transitions. These themes were translated into 5
      self-management modules: understanding treatment history and the survivorship
      care plan, managing health care logistics and insurance, communicating with
      health care providers and family members involved in care, dealing with emotions,
      and staying healthy in the context of life transitions. Feedback from the key
      stakeholders indicated that the content was relevant but should include
      participative elements (videos and tailored feedback) to make the intervention
      more engaging. The AYA survivors were receptive to the idea of working with a
      peer mentor and expressed a preference for using SMS text messaging, telephone
      calls, or videoconference to communicate with their mentor. CONCLUSIONS:
      Incorporating AYA survivors, parents, and providers in the design was essential
      to developing the content of a self-management and peer-mentoring intervention.
      AYA survivors confirmed the important targets for the intervention and
      facilitated design decisions in line with our target users' preferences. The next
      step will be to conduct a single-arm trial to determine the feasibility and
      acceptability of the proposed intervention among AYA survivors of childhood
      cancer.

TI  - Robust and Efficient Assessment of Potency (REAP) as a quantitative tool for
      dose-response curve estimation.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.78634 [doi]
LID - e78634 [pii]
AB  - The median-effect equation has been widely used to describe the dose-response
      relationship and identify compounds that activate or inhibit specific disease
      targets in contemporary drug discovery. However, the experimental data often
      contain extreme responses, which may significantly impair the estimation accuracy
      and impede valid quantitative assessment in the standard estimation procedure. To
      improve the quantitative estimation of the dose-response relationship, we
      introduce a novel approach based on robust beta regression. Substantive
      simulation studies under various scenarios demonstrate solid evidence that the
      proposed approach consistently provides robust estimation for the median-effect
      equation, particularly when there are extreme outcome observations. Moreover,
      simulation studies illustrate that the proposed approach also provides a narrower
      confidence interval, suggesting a higher power in statistical testing. Finally,
      to efficiently and conveniently perform common lab data analyses, we develop a
      freely accessible web-based analytic tool to facilitate the quantitative
      implementation of the proposed approach for the scientific community.

OAB - Finding a new drug which is both safe and efficient is an expensive and
      time-consuming endeavour. In particular, establishing the 'dose-effect
      relationship' - how beneficial a drug is at different dosages - can be
      challenging. Predicting this curve requires gathering experimental data by
      exposing and recording how cells respond to various levels of the drug. However, 
      extreme values are often observed at low and high dosages, potentially
      introducing errors that are hard to correct in the prediction process. Yet, these
      extreme observations are sometimes genuine so researchers cannot just ignore
      them. To improve dose-effect estimation, Zhou, Liu, Fang et al. developed a new
      general-purpose approach. It uses advanced statistical modelling to account for
      extremes in lab data. This strategy outperformed other methods when dealing with 
      these observations while also providing higher efficiency in data analysis with
      more uniform data in experiments. To facilitate implementation, Zhou, Liu, Fang
      et al. set up a user-friendly tool baptized 'REAP'; this free online resource
      allows scientists without advanced statistical experience to harness the new
      approach and to perform dose-effect analysis more easily and accurately. This
      could boost research across many different disciplines that examine the effects
      of chemicals on cells.

TI  - Interactions between Nitric Oxide and Hyaluronan Implicate the Migration of
      Breast Cancer Cells.
LID - 10.1021/acs.biomac.2c00545 [doi]
AB  - Nitric oxide ((*)NO) is one of the prominent free radicals, playing a pivotal
      role in breast cancer progression. Hyaluronic acid (HA) plays an essential role
      in neutralizing free radicals in tumor tissues. However, its interactions with
      nitric oxide have not been thoroughly investigated. Hence, this study attempts to
      understand the mechanism of these interactions and the different effects on the
      intracellular (*)NO levels and migration of breast cancer cells. The affinity of 
      HA to scavenge (*)NO was investigated alongside the accompanying changes in
      specific physico-chemical properties and the further effects on the (*)NO-induced
      attachment and migration of the breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and HCC1806.
      The reaction of the nitrogen dioxide radical, formed via (*)NO/O2 interactions,
      with HA initiated a series of oxidative reactions, which, in the presence of
      (*)NO, induce the fragmentation of the polymeric chains. Furthermore, these
      interactions were found to hinder the NO-induced migration of cancer cells.
      However, the NO-induced HA modification/fragmentation was inhibited in the
      presence of hemin, a NO-scavenging compound. Collectively, these results help
      toward understanding the involvement of HA in the (*)NO-induced cell migration
      and suggest the possible modification of HA, used as one of the main materials in
      different biomedical applications.

TI  - Therapeutic Value of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Patients With Melanoma: A
      Randomized Clinical Trial.
LID - 10.1001/jamasurg.2022.2055 [doi]
AB  - Importance: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is a standard staging procedure for 
      cutaneous melanoma. Regional disease control is a clinically important
      therapeutic goal of surgical intervention, including nodal surgery. Objective: To
      determine how frequently SLN biopsy without completion lymph node dissection
      (CLND) results in long-term regional nodal disease control in patients with SLN
      metastases. Design, Setting, and Participants: The second Multicenter Selective
      Lymphadenectomy Trial (MSLT-II), a prospective multicenter randomized clinical
      trial, randomized participants with SLN metastases to either CLND or nodal
      observation. The current analysis examines observation patients with regard to
      regional nodal recurrence. Trial patients were aged 18 to 75 years with melanoma 
      metastatic to SLN(s). Data were collected from December 2004 to April 2019, and
      data were analyzed from July 2020 to January 2022. Interventions: Nodal
      observation with ultrasonography rather than CLND. Main Outcomes and Measures:
      In-basin nodal recurrence. Results: Of 823 included patients, 479 (58.2%) were
      male, and the mean (SD) age was 52.8 (13.8) years. Among 855 observed basins, at 
      10 years, 80.2% (actuarial; 95% CI, 77-83) of basins were free of nodal
      recurrence. By univariable analysis, freedom from regional nodal recurrence was
      associated with age younger than 50 years (hazard ratio [HR], 0.49; 95% CI,
      0.34-0.70; P < .001), nonulcerated melanoma (HR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.36-0.49; P <
      .001), thinner primary melanoma (less than 1.5 mm; HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.27-0.78; P
      = .004), axillary basin (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.44-0.86; P = .005), fewer positive
      SLNs (1 vs 3 or more; HR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.14-0.75; P = .008), and SLN tumor
      burden (measured by diameter less than 1 mm [HR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.26-0.60; P =
      .001] or less than 5% area [HR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.24-0.54; P < .001]). By
      multivariable analysis, younger age (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.39-0.84; P = .004),
      thinner primary melanoma (HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.22-0.70; P = .002), axillary basin 
      (HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.31-0.96; P = .03), SLN metastasis diameter less than 1 mm
      (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.33-0.81; P = .007), and area less than 5% (HR, 0.58; 95% CI,
      0.38-0.88; P = .01) were associated with basin control. When looking at the
      identified risk factors of age (50 years or older), ulceration, Breslow thickness
      greater than 3.5 mm, nonaxillary basin, and tumor burden of maximum diameter of 1
      mm or greater and/or metastasis area of 5% or greater and excluding missing value
      cases, basin disease-free rates at 5 years were 96% (95% CI, 88-100) for patients
      with 0 risk factors, 89% (95% CI, 82-96) for 1 risk factor, 86% (95% CI, 80-93)
      for 2 risk factors, 80% (95% CI, 71-89) for 3 risk factors, 61% (95% CI, 48-74)
      for 4 risk factors, and 54% (95% CI, 36-72) for 5 or 6 risk factors. Conclusions 
      and Relevance: This randomized clinical trial was the largest prospective
      evaluation of long-term regional basin control in patients with melanoma who had 
      nodal observation after removal of a positive SLN. SLN biopsy without CLND
      cleared disease in the affected nodal basin in most patients, even those with
      multiple risk factors for in-basin recurrence. In addition to its well-validated 
      value in staging, SLN biopsy may also be regarded as therapeutic in some
      patients. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00297895.

TI  - Association of Endocrine Therapy Initiation Timeliness With Adherence and
      Continuation in Low-Income Women With Breast Cancer.
PG  - e2225345
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.25345 [doi]
AB  - Importance: Though adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) has proven efficacy in
      treating hormone receptor-positive (HR-positive) breast cancer, patient adherence
      to AET and continuation of treatment as recommended by guidelines remain
      suboptimal, especially for low-income patients. Objective: To quantify timelines 
      for initiating AET and assess their association with short- and long-term
      adherence and continuation of AET in low-income women with breast cancer. Design,
      Setting, and Participants: This population-based retrospective cohort study
      included women younger than 65 years diagnosed with first primary HR-positive
      breast cancer between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2013, followed up for 5
      years after the first use of AET through December 2018, and identified from the
      linked Missouri Cancer Registry and Medicaid claims data set. Exposures: Time to 
      initiation (TTI) as days from the date of last treatment (surgery, radiotherapy, 
      or chemotherapy) to the first date of AET prescription fill. Main Outcomes and
      Measures: The main outcomes were adherence to AET as medication possession ratio 
      of 80% or greater and continuation of AET as no gap in medication supply for at
      least 90 days. Odds ratios (ORs) of adherence and continuation over 1 to 5 years 
      were estimated using logistic regression adjusted for demographic, clinical, and 
      neighborhood variables. Analyses were performed between September 1, 2020, and
      May 31, 2022. Results: Among 1711 patients, median TTI was 53 (IQR, 26-117) days.
      A total of 1029 patients (60.1%) were aged 50 to 64 years old, 1270 (74.2%) were 
      non-Hispanic White, and 1133 (66.2%) were unmarried. In the first year after
      initiation, 1317 (77.0%) were adherent and 1015 (59.3%) continued AET. Over the
      full 5 years, 376 (22.0%) were adherent and 409 (23.9%) continued AET. Longer TTI
      was significantly associated with poorer adherence at every year, with an OR of
      0.97 (95% CI, 0.95-0.99) for 1-year adherence and an OR of 0.94 (95% CI,
      0.90-0.97) for 5-year adherence per 1-month increase in TTI. Longer TTI was also 
      associated with lower odds of short-term, but not long-term, continuation (OR,
      0.97 [95% CI, 0.95-0.99] for 1-year continuation and 0.98 [95% CI, 0.96-0.99] for
      2-year continuation). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, longer
      time to AET initiation was associated with lower odds of short-term and long-term
      adherence to AET in Medicaid-insured patients with breast cancer. Therefore,
      early interventions targeting treatment initiation timelines may positively
      impact adherence throughout the course of treatment and, therefore, outcomes.

TI  - Nucleic Acid Aptamers Increase the Anticancer Efficiency and Reduce the Toxicity 
      of Cisplatin-Arabinogalactan Conjugates In Vivo.
LID - 10.1089/nat.2022.0024 [doi]
AB  - Cisplatin is an effective drug for treating various cancer types. However, it is 
      highly toxic for both healthy and tumor cells. Therefore, there is a need to
      reduce its therapeutic dose and increase targeted bioavailability. One of the
      ways to achieve this could be the coating of cisplatin with polysaccharides and
      specific carriers for targeted delivery. Nucleic acid aptamers could be used as
      carriers for the specific delivery of medicine to cancer cells.
      Cisplatin-arabinogalactan-aptamer (Cis-AG-Ap) conjugate was synthesized based on 
      Cis-dichlorodiammineplatinum, Siberian larch arabinogalactan, and aptamer AS-42
      specific to heat-shock proteins (HSP) 71 kDa (Hspa8) and HSP 90-beta (Hsp90ab1). 
      The antitumor effect was estimated using ascites and metastatic Ehrlich tumor
      models. Cis-AG-Ap toxicity was assessed by blood biochemistry on healthy mice.
      Here, we demonstrated enhanced anticancer activity of Cis-AG-Ap and its specific 
      accumulation in tumor foci. It was shown that targeted delivery allowed a 15-fold
      reduction in the therapeutic dose of cisplatin and its toxicity. Cis-AG-Ap
      sufficiently suppressed the growth of Ehrlich's ascites carcinoma, the mass and
      extent of tumor metastasis in vivo. Arabinogalactan and the aptamers promoted
      cisplatin efficiency by enhancing its bioavailability. The described strategy
      could be very promising for targeted anticancer therapy.

TI  - Development and Modification of a Culturally Tailored Education Program to
      Prevent Breast Cancer in Korean Immigrant Women in New York City.
LID - 10.1007/s13187-022-02207-2 [doi]
AB  - Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer in Korean American (KA) women. In
      view of its high prevalence in these women, their low screening rates, and the
      cultural influence of BC risk factors in their lifestyles, we developed a
      community-based culturally tailored BC prevention program, the Korean Breast
      Cancer Risk Reduction Program (KBCRRP). Guided by the PRECEDE-PROCEDE and health 
      belief models, the KBCRRP was developed to achieve four goals: (1) healthy
      weight, (2) physically active lifestyle, (3) healthy diet, and (4) BC screening
      and adherence. KBCRRP combines effective multicomponent strategies for BC
      screening and a group-based lifestyle intervention incorporating traditional
      Korean health beliefs and is tailored for BC risk reduction. In this paper, we
      provide an overview of the program, the process of program development,
      implementation, and evaluation, and modification during the COVID-19 pandemic.
      The initial program involved 8 weeks of in-person group education sessions led by
      interdisciplinary healthcare professionals and 16 weeks of follow-up involving
      smartphone applications, phone calls, and text messaging from trained lifestyle
      coaches. Participants received opportunities to obtain free mammography during
      the program. After feasibility testing, the program was modified by incorporating
      participants' feedback. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we provided the program
      using the Zoom video platform. Participants' recruitment and retention during the
      pandemic was successful, reflecting the fact that virtual delivery of group-based
      education was a feasible and acceptable alternative to in-person sessions.
      Collaboration with community organizations serving the target population is the
      key to developing and sustaining a successful community-based educational
      program.

TI  - Health Literacy and Radiation Therapy: a Current State Assessment of Patient
      Education Materials.
LID - 10.1007/s13187-022-02208-1 [doi]
AB  - In order to mitigate low levels of health literacy among patients, there is need 
      to evaluate patient education (PE) materials and to ensure that the information
      is readily accessible to patients. The quality and comprehensiveness of radiation
      therapy materials were evaluated at fourteen cancer centres. To assess quality,
      PE leaders independently conducted readability, actionability and
      understandability assessments of materials. To evaluate comprehensiveness, an
      assessment was conducted of the scope of symptoms covered in extant materials,
      and the modality they were produced in (e.g. pamphlet, video). A total of 555 PE 
      materials were reviewed for comprehensiveness and modality and seventy underwent 
      evaluation against health literacy best practice standards. Most materials (n =
      64, 91%) had a reading grade level above the recommended grade 6 ([Formula: see
      text] = 9, range = 4-12). Under half (n = 34, 49%) scored at or above the 80%
      threshold for understandability ([Formula: see text] = 74%, 33-100%) and just
      over half (n = 36, 51%) scored at or above the 80% target for actionability
      ([Formula: see text] = 71%, 33-100%). Only two cancer centres (n = 2/14, 14%) had
      PE materials covering the breadth of symptoms related to radiation therapy and
      the vast majority of materials were pamphlets (89%). Findings indicate that most 
      radiation therapy PE materials used in cancer centres do not meet health literacy
      best practices, and there is a disparity between cancer centres in the topics
      that are available to patients and family. This evaluation highlights the need to
      better incorporate health literacy best practices into the development of
      radiation therapy PE materials and strategies to improve accessibility of such
      health information.

TI  - Assessment of age as different variable types for determining survival in
      differentiated thyroid cancer.
LID - 10.1007/s12020-022-03148-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The current tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) system uses an age of 55 years
      as a threshold for differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). The aim of our study was 
      to explore the concept of using age as a continuous variable. METHODS: A total of
      36,559 patients with DTC in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
      (SEER) database and 7491 patients in our centers were enrolled. Overall survival 
      (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) were compared. Furthermore, the different
      statistical model performance of the 6th edition TNM system and age cutoffs for
      papillary (PTC) and follicular thyroid cancer (FTC) were assessed. Then, a
      nomogram was built and validated to evaluate the efficacy of age as a continuous 
      variable for predicting survival. RESULTS: The OS and CSS of patients with DTC
      were significantly increased in patients <55 years compared with those aged >/=55
      years. However, no significant differences in prognosis were observed in certain 
      groups as patients between 50 and 60 years were stratified by 1-year increments. 
      Furthermore, the highest concordance index (C-index) was observed in the TNM
      staging without an age cutoff in SEER database (0.895), our two centers (0.877)
      and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves showed different age cutoffs
      for PTC and FTC. More importantly, the nomogram incorporating age as a continuous
      variable showed a favorable area under the ROC curve and calibration for training
      and validation groups. CONCLUSIONS: The utilization of age as a continuous
      variable is a rational approach for predicting outcome in DTC patients.

TI  - The value of exosome-derived noncoding RNAs in colorectal cancer proliferation,
      metastasis, and clinical applications.
LID - 10.1007/s12094-022-02908-6 [doi]
AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in the world today, and
      its incidence and mortality rates are increasing every year. The ease of
      proliferation and metastasis of CRC has long been an important reason for its
      high mortality rate. Exosomes serve as key mediators that mediate communication
      between tumor cells and various other cells. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have been
      shown to play a key role in apoptosis, immunosuppression and proliferation
      metastasis in cancer. ncRNAs are loaded on exosomes and initiate the onset of
      metastasis by promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) at the primary
      site of the tumor. Meanwhile, exosome-derived ncRNAs construct a pre-metastatic
      niche (PMN) for CRC metastasis by forming an inflammatory microenvironment in
      distant organs, immunosuppression, and promoting angiogenesis and remodeling of
      the extracellular matrix. Here, we summarize the specific mechanisms associated
      with exosome-derived ncRNAs promoting local invasion and metastasis in CRC.
      Finally, we focus on their value for clinical application in future CRC diagnosis
      and treatment.

TI  - Social risk factors among individuals with a history of cancer during the
      COVID-19 pandemic.
LID - 10.1007/s11764-022-01235-7 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and its economic
      consequences may disproportionately impact cancer survivors and their overall
      health-related quality of life. The objective of this study was to examine
      whether cancer survivors experienced higher levels of financial strain or food
      insecurity compared to those without a history of cancer. METHODS: Kaiser
      Permanente Research Bank (KPRB) study participants were invited to complete a
      series of electronic surveys starting April 2020 to assess the impact of the
      COVID-19 pandemic. Participants who completed the initial survey and one
      follow-up survey were included. The odds of financial strain and food insecurity 
      in those with and without a history of cancer were estimated using multinomial
      logistic regression. RESULTS: Cancer survivors (n = 16,231) had lower odds of
      reporting "somewhat hard" (AOR = 0.77) and "very hard" (AOR = 0.67) financial
      strain, and food insecurity "sometimes" (AOR = 0.70) and "often" (AOR = 0.55)
      compared to those with no history of cancer (n = 88,409). Non-Hispanic (NH) Black
      and Hispanic cancer survivors had higher odds compared to NH Whites of reporting 
      financial strain and food insecurity. Smokers and those with multiple
      comorbidities had higher odds of reporting financial strain and food insecurity
      among cancer survivors. CONCLUSIONS: While cancer survivors overall did not
      report greater financial strain or food insecurity than individuals without a
      history of cancer, subsets of cancer survivors are experiencing greater social
      risks during the pandemic and should be prioritized for screening for social risk
      factors. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Incorporating screening for social
      risk factors into care coordination workflows for subsets of cancer survivors
      should be a priority.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related death in the
      world, however lung cancer screening has not been implemented in most countries
      at a population level. A previous Cochrane Review found limited evidence for the 
      effectiveness of lung cancer screening with chest radiography (CXR) or sputum
      cytology in reducing lung cancer-related mortality, however there has been
      increasing evidence supporting screening with low-dose computed tomography
      (LDCT). OBJECTIVES: To determine whether screening for lung cancer using LDCT of 
      the chest reduces lung cancer-related mortality and to evaluate the possible
      harms of LDCT screening. SEARCH METHODS: We performed the search in collaboration
      with the Information Specialist of the Cochrane Lung Cancer Group and included
      the Cochrane Lung Cancer Group Trial Register, Cochrane Central Register of
      Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, the Cochrane Library, current issue), MEDLINE
      (accessed via PubMed) and Embase in our search. We also searched the clinical
      trial registries to identify unpublished and ongoing trials. We did not impose
      any restriction on language of publication. The search was performed up to 31
      July 2021. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of lung cancer
      screening using LDCT and reporting mortality or harm outcomes. DATA COLLECTION
      AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors were involved in independently assessing trials 
      for eligibility, extraction of trial data and characteristics, and assessing risk
      of bias of the included trials using the Cochrane RoB 1 tool. We assessed the
      certainty of evidence using GRADE. Primary outcomes were lung cancer-related
      mortality and harms of screening. We performed a meta-analysis, where
      appropriate, for all outcomes using a random-effects model. We only included
      trials in the analysis of mortality outcomes if they had at least 5 years of
      follow-up. We reported risk ratios (RRs) and hazard ratios (HRs), with 95%
      confidence intervals (CIs) and used the I(2) statistic to investigate
      heterogeneity. MAIN RESULTS: We included 11 trials in this review with a total of
      94,445 participants. Trials were conducted in Europe and the USA in people aged
      40 years or older, with most trials having an entry requirement of >/= 20
      pack-year smoking history (e.g. 1 pack of cigarettes/day for 20 years or 2
      packs/day for 10 years etc.). One trial included male participants only. Eight
      trials were phase three RCTs, with two feasibility RCTs and one pilot RCT. Seven 
      of the included trials had no screening as a comparison, and four trials had CXR 
      screening as a comparator. Screening frequency included annual, biennial and
      incrementing intervals. The duration of screening ranged from 1 year to 10 years.
      Mortality follow-up was from 5 years to approximately 12 years. None of the
      included trials were at low risk of bias across all domains. The certainty of
      evidence was moderate to low across different outcomes, as assessed by GRADE. In 
      the meta-analysis of trials assessing lung cancer-related mortality, we included 
      eight trials (91,122 participants), and there was a reduction in mortality of 21%
      with LDCT screening compared to control groups of no screening or CXR screening
      (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.87; 8 trials, 91,122 participants; moderate-certainty 
      evidence). There were probably no differences in subgroups for analyses by
      control type, sex, geographical region, and nodule management algorithm. Females 
      appeared to have a larger lung cancer-related mortality benefit compared to males
      with LDCT screening. There was also a reduction in all-cause mortality (including
      lung cancer-related) of 5% (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.91 to 0.99; 8 trials, 91,107
      participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Invasive tests occurred more
      frequently in the LDCT group (RR 2.60, 95% CI 2.41 to 2.80; 3 trials, 60,003
      participants; moderate-certainty evidence). However, analysis of 60-day
      postoperative mortality was not significant between groups (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.24 
      to 1.94; 2 trials, 409 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). False-positive
      results and recall rates were higher with LDCT screening compared to screening
      with CXR, however there was low-certainty evidence in the meta-analyses due to
      heterogeneity and risk of bias concerns. Estimated overdiagnosis with LDCT
      screening was 18%, however the 95% CI was 0 to 36% (risk difference (RD) 0.18,
      95% CI -0.00 to 0.36; 5 trials, 28,656 participants; low-certainty evidence).
      Four trials compared different aspects of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) 
      using various measures. Anxiety was pooled from three trials, with participants
      in LDCT screening reporting lower anxiety scores than in the control group
      (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.43, 95% CI -0.59 to -0.27; 3 trials, 8153 
      participants; low-certainty evidence). There were insufficient data to comment on
      the impact of LDCT screening on smoking behaviour. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The
      current evidence supports a reduction in lung cancer-related mortality with the
      use of LDCT for lung cancer screening in high-risk populations (those over the
      age of 40 with a significant smoking exposure). However, there are limited data
      on harms and further trials are required to determine participant selection and
      optimal frequency and duration of screening, with potential for significant
      overdiagnosis of lung cancer. Trials are ongoing for lung cancer screening in
      non-smokers.

TI  - Weight fluctuation, mortality, and cardiovascular disease in adults in 18 years
      of follow-up: Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study.
LID - 10.1007/s40618-022-01881-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Controversies exist in the effect of body weight loss and fluctuation on
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality. This study aims to assess the effect 
      of weight variability on CVD and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in the
      Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS) cohort. METHOD: Participants aged >/= 40
      year at the baseline period with at least 3 BMI measurements were included in
      this study. After excluding individuals with cancer, CVD, end-stage renal
      disease, systemic use of glucocorticoids, pregnancy, and missing covariates at
      the baseline, a total of 3461 participants were enrolled and followed for 18
      years. BMI variability was defined using root mean squared error (RMSE) and
      average successive variability (ASV). In the RMSE method, BMI variability was
      calculated using the best-fitting model for BMI trend of each subject.
      Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were applied to assess BMI
      variability's effect on CVD and mortality. RESULTS: Among the 3461 participants
      in this study, the group with the highest weight variability had an increased
      risk of death for all-cause (HR 1.65; 95% CI 1.21-2.25), non-cardiovascular (HR
      1.77; 95% CI 1.24-2.53), and non-cancer (HR 1.77; 95% CI 1.25-2.50) mortality.
      However, BMI variability showed to be protective against CVD (HR 0.76; 95% CI
      0.6-0.97). These findings were significant in males, non-smokers, participants
      with age </= 60 year, BMI < 30, negative BMI slope, and both diabetic and
      non-diabetic subjects. CONCLUSION: High BMI variability is associated with
      increased risk of all-cause, non-CVD, and non-cancer mortality, although
      protective for the CVD event. Appropriate strategies for body weight maintenance 
      after weight loss could be adopted to avoid weight variability, particularly in
      non-obese subjects.

TI  - Likely change indexes improve estimates of individual change on patient-reported 
      outcomes.
LID - 10.1007/s11136-022-03200-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Individual change on a patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure can be
      assessed by statistical significance and meaningfulness to patients. We explored 
      the relationship between these two criteria by varying the confidence levels of
      the coefficient of repeatability (CR) on the Patient-Reported Outcomes
      Measurement Information System (R) Physical Function (PF) 10a (PF10a) measure.
      METHODS: In a sample of 1129 adult cancer patients, we estimated
      individual-change thresholds on the PF10a from baseline to 6 weeks later with the
      CR at 50%, 68%, and 95% confidence. We also assessed agreement with group- and
      individual-level thresholds from anchor-based methods [mean change and receiver
      operating characteristic (ROC) curve] using a PF-specific patient global
      impression of change (PGIC). RESULTS: CRs at 50%, 68%, and 95% confidence were 3,
      4, and 7 raw score points, respectively. The ROC- and mean-change-based
      thresholds for deterioration were -4 and -6; for improvement they were both 2.
      Kappas for agreement between anchor-based thresholds and CRs for deterioration
      ranged between kappa = 0.65 and 1.00, while for improvement, they ranged between 
      0.35 and 0.83. Agreement between the PGIC and all CRs always fell below "good"
      (kappa < 0.40) for deterioration (0.30-0.33) and were lower for improvement
      (0.16-0.28). CONCLUSIONS: In comparison to the CR at 95% confidence, CRs at 50%
      and 68% confidence (considered likely change indexes) have the advantage of
      maximizing the proportion of patients appropriately classified as changed
      according to statistical significance and meaningfulness.

TI  - Growth dynamics of breast cancer stem cells: effects of self-feedback and EMT
      mechanisms.
LID - 10.1007/s12064-022-00374-w [doi]
AB  - Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) with the ability to self-renew and differentiate
      have been identified in primary breast cancer tissues and cell lines. The BCSCs
      are often resistant to traditional radiation and/or chemotherapies. Previous
      studies have also shown that successful therapy must eradicate cancer stem cells.
      The purpose of this paper is to develop a mathematical model with self-feedback
      mechanism to illustrate the issues regarding the difficulties of absolutely
      eliminating a breast cancer. In addition, we introduce the mechanism of the
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to investigate the influence of EMT on
      the effects of breast cancer growth and treatment. Results indicate that the EMT 
      mechanism facilitates the growth of breast cancer and makes breast cancer more
      difficult to be cured. Therefore, targeting the signals involved in EMT can halt 
      tumor progression in breast cancer. Finally, we apply the experimental data to
      carry out numerical simulations and validate our theoretical conclusions.

TI  - Heavy metals in vegetables: a review of status, human health concerns, and
      management options.
LID - 10.1007/s11356-022-22210-w [doi]
AB  - For sustainable global growth, food security is a prime concern issue, both
      quantitatively and qualitatively. Adverse effects on crop quality from
      contaminants like heavy metals have affected food security and human health.
      Vegetables comprise the essential and nutritious part of the human diet as they
      contain a lot of health-promoting minerals and vitamins. However, the inadvertent
      excess accumulation of heavy metals (As, Cd, Hg, and Pb) in vegetables and their 
      subsequent intake by humans may affect their physiology and metabolomics and has 
      been associated with diseases like cancer, mental retardation, and
      immunosuppression. Many known sources of hazardous metals are volcano eruptions, 
      soil erosion, use of chemical fertilizers in agriculture, the use of pesticides
      and herbicides, and irrigation with wastewater, industrial effluents, etc. that
      contaminate the vegetables through the soil, air and water. In this review, the
      problem of heavy metal contamination in vegetables is discussed along with the
      prospective management strategies like soil amendments, application of
      bioadsorbents, membrane filtration, bioremediation, and nanoremediation.

TI  - Determinants of clinical outcomes of gastric cancer patients treated with
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy: a sub-analysis of the PRODIGY study.
LID - 10.1007/s10120-022-01325-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In this post hoc analysis of the PRODIGY study, we aimed to
      investigate factors associated with survival outcomes and provide evidence for
      designing optimal perioperative treatment strategies for gastric cancer patients 
      receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 212 patients
      in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group of the PRODIGY study were included as the
      study population. The prognostic impact of clinicopathologic factors, including
      the initial radiological clinical stage (cStage) and post-neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy pathological stage (ypStage), was analyzed. RESULTS: The median age 
      was 58 years. The majority of patients (77.4%) had cStage III disease, and about 
      10% and 25% had ypStage 0 and I disease, respectively. According to the initial
      cStage, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were
      significantly different (P < 0.01). PFS and OS were also different according to
      the ypStage (P < 0.01). In multivariate analyses, cStage IIIC disease (vs. cStage
      II) and ypStage II and III disease (vs. ypStage 0/I) were independent factors for
      poor survival outcomes. Based on the patterns of PFS and OS according to both
      cStage and ypStage, three patient groups were defined. These groups showed
      distinct PFS and OS (P < 0.01) with 5-year PFS rates of 95.7%, 77.9%, and 31.3%
      and 5-year OS rates of 95.7%, 82.4%, and 42.5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Both
      initial cStage and ypStage were independent factors for survival outcomes of
      gastric cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Efforts should be 
      made to develop optimal peri-operative treatment strategies for patients at
      different risks according to cStage and ypStage.

TI  - The multifaceted mechanisms of malignant glioblastoma progression and clinical
      implications.
LID - 10.1007/s10555-022-10051-5 [doi]
AB  - With the application of high throughput sequencing technologies at single-cell
      resolution, studies of the tumor microenvironment in glioblastoma, one of the
      most aggressive and invasive of all cancers, have revealed immense cellular and
      tissue heterogeneity. A unique extracellular scaffold system adapts to and
      supports progressive infiltration and migration of tumor cells, which is
      characterized by altered composition, effector delivery, and mechanical
      properties. The spatiotemporal interactions between malignant and immune cells
      generate an immunosuppressive microenvironment, contributing to the failure of
      effective anti-tumor immune attack. Among the heterogeneous tumor cell
      subpopulations of glioblastoma, glioma stem cells (GSCs), which exhibit
      tumorigenic properties and strong invasive capacity, are critical for tumor
      growth and are believed to contribute to therapeutic resistance and tumor
      recurrence. Here we discuss the role of extracellular matrix and immune cell
      populations, major components of the tumor ecosystem in glioblastoma, as well as 
      signaling pathways that regulate GSC maintenance and invasion. We also highlight 
      emerging advances in therapeutic targeting of these components.

LID - 10.1007/s10735-022-10093-7 [doi]
AB  - Aldo-keto reductase family one, member B10 (AKR1B10) has been reported to be
      involved in the tumorigenesis of various cancers. It has been reported that
      colorectal cancer is closely associated with chronic inflammation, but the
      underlying molecular mechanisms are still elusive. In our study, we evaluated the
      relationship between AKR1B10 expression and clinicopathological characteristics
      of colon cancer and showed that AKR1B10 expression was significantly correlated
      with the T stage and clinical stage of colon cancer. Knockdown of AKR1B10
      significantly decreased the expression of the inflammatory cytokines IL1alpha and
      IL6 induced by lipopolysaccharide by inhibiting the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. 
      Furthermore, AKR1B10 depends on its reductase activity to affect the NF-kappaB
      signaling pathway and subsequently affect the production of inflammatory
      cytokines. In addition, knockdown of AKR1B10 effectively reduced cell
      proliferation and clonogenic growth, indicating the biological role of AKR1B10 in
      colon cancer. Together, our findings provide important insights into a previously
      unrecognized role of AKR1B10 in colon cancer.

TI  - Clinical, Radiographic and Histopathological Analysis of Craniopharyngiomas and
      Ameloblastomas: A Systematic Review.
LID - 10.1007/s12105-022-01473-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Craniopharyngiomas and ameloblastomas are tumors of epithelial
      origin, mostly characterized by a benign course, slow growth and for being
      locally invasive. Some studies highlight the similarity of these neoplasms,
      especially regarding histopathological aspects. In this context, the aim of the
      present study was to carry out a systematic literature review correlating the
      clinical, radiographic, and histopathological aspects of these two tumors.
      METHODS: Searches were conducted at the Pubmed, Periodicos Capes, Scopus, Science
      Direct, Web of Science and Scielo databases, according to the following inclusion
      criteria: publications in English or Spanish, from the 2000s and 2021, comprising
      case report studies, case series and literature reviews. RESULTS: Considering
      clinical and radiographic aspects, it is evident that craniopharyngiomas and
      ameloblastomas exhibit few similarities. Histopathologically, however,
      adamantinomatous craniopharyngiomas are the type of tumor that most resembles
      ameloblastomas, both concerning the formation of palisade epithelial cords and
      epithelial formations. Regarding to recurrences in cases of craniopharyngioma, it
      appears that a more radical surgical resection is more related to a lower
      recurrence rate for both craniopharyngiomas and ameloblastomas. As for the
      outcome, it was observed that craniopharyngiomas have a greater relationship with
      possible systemic disorders. CONCLUSIONS: This histopathological similarity is
      related to their origin, since both craniopharyngiomas and ameloblastomas share a
      relationship with the oral cavity, either partially, as in the case of
      craniopharyngiomas, or totally, as in ameloblastomas, not comprising the same
      lesion in different locations. It is important to note that the differential
      morphogenetic evidence observed herein between these lesions opens up a new field
      of study aiming at better treatment alternatives in the future.

TI  - Comparison of Arterial Infusion Chemotherapy and Chemoembolization for Locally
      Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma: a Multicenter Retrospective Study.
LID - 10.1007/s11605-022-05421-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a poor prognosis. We 
      aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of hepatic arterial infusion
      chemotherapy (HAIC) for locally advanced HCC compared to transcatheter arterial
      chemoembolization (TACE). METHODS: A propensity score-matched cohort study was
      performed in patients with locally advanced HCC with >/= 4 tumors or portal vein 
      tumor thrombosis (PVTT) who underwent either HAIC using oxaliplatin plus
      raltitrexed or TACE at three institutions between June 2015 and December 2021.
      Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rates 
      (ORR), and adverse events (AEs) were compared between the groups. RESULTS: After 
      propensity score matching, 62 pairs of patients were evaluated. The HAIC group
      had longer OS (15.0 [95% CI: 12.1-17.9] vs. 9.0 [95% CI: 5.1-12.9] months; P =
      0.034), better PFS (6.7 [95% CI: 5.1-8.3] vs. 4.0 [95% CI: 2.6-5.4] months; P =
      0.020), and a higher ORR (RECIST 1.1: 54.8% vs. 11.3%; P < 0.001) than the TACE
      group in the intention-to-treat population. Compared with the TACE group, Grade
      1-2 nausea and vomiting occurred significantly more frequently in the HAIC group.
      CONCLUSION: Compared to TACE, HAIC significantly increased the ORR of locally
      advanced HCC with multiple tumors or portal invasion and prolonged survival
      without causing a significant increase in severe AEs.

TI  - Management of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia in Children and Young Adults.
LID - 10.1007/s11899-022-00673-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Due to lack of pediatric-specific data, the management of
      chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in pediatric, adolescents, and young adults is
      guided by adult CML evidence-based recommendations. Pediatric CML presents
      differently than adult CML and is often a more aggressive disease with different 
      biological and host factors, yet there is sparse literature on how to address
      those differences. RECENT FINDINGS: Over the past two decades, tyrosine kinase
      inhibitors (TKIs) have changed the way CML is treated. There are currently three 
      FDA-approved TKIs (imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib) for pediatric patients.
      When choosing which TKI to begin treatment with, there are many factors that
      should be considered on a case-to-case basis to obtain optimal outcomes. The
      safety profiles for long-term TKI use in pediatrics require further study. Unlike
      adults, children are still actively growing during TKI use, and the effect on
      development can be detrimental. TKI therapy is not recommended during pregnancy
      with variable but significant risk of fetal abnormalities and miscarriage,
      warranting counseling for young female patients prior to beginning TKIs. Attempts
      for treatment-free remission (TFR) by planned TKI cessation in eligible adult
      patients in deep and sustained molecular remission are now done as a standard of 
      practice. However, data is sparse in the pediatric population. There is currently
      an ongoing Children's Oncology Group (COG) study to determine the feasibility of 
      TFR as a treatment goal. Further research and additional pediatric trials are
      needed to characterize the unique aspects of CML in children and adolescents and 
      optimize outcomes.

TI  - Analysis of uveal melanomas and paired constitutional DNA for exclusion of a
      BAP1-tumor predisposition syndrome.
LID - 10.1007/s10689-022-00310-3 [doi]
AB  - Uveal melanoma (UM) is a rare tumor originating from melanocytic cells in the
      eye. Familial aggregation of UM is rare and can occur as part of the tumor
      predisposition syndrome BAP1-TPDS. However, family history alone will only
      identify a subset of patients with BAP1-TPDS. In the present study, we used
      sequential testing of tumor and blood DNA from UM patients for differential
      diagnosis of BAP1-TPDS. The study group was an unselected prospective cohort of
      patients from whom UM tissue was available. First, chromosome 3 status in tumor
      DNA was determined in all 140 patients who consented to participate. As tumors
      with disomy 3 rarely show BAP1 alterations, sequence analysis of this gene was
      performed in the 72 tumors with monosomy 3 (M3) or partial M3 only. We identified
      oncogenic BAP1 alterations in 52 of these tumors (72%). Targeted sequencing of
      DNA from matched peripheral blood showed pathogenic variants in two patients
      (3.8%) thus proving BAP1-TPDS. Only one of these two patients also had a medical 
      history suggestive of this syndrome. Conversely, in three patients known to have 
      had additional tumors before diagnosis of UM, constitutional heterozygosity for a
      BAP1 mutation was excluded. Altogether, in 50 patients we could exclude BAP1-TPDS
      with high diagnostic certainty. The results of our study support that genetic
      testing for BAP1-TPDS should be offered to all patients with UM. Moreover, as
      genetic information from the tumor can help exclude heritable risk, the strategy 
      for analysis should include efforts to obtain tumor samples for testing.

TI  - Causal and putative pathogenic mutations identified in 39% of children with
      primary steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome in South Africa.
LID - 10.1007/s00431-022-04581-x [doi]
AB  - There is a paucity of data identifying genetic mutations that account for the
      high rate of steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) in a South African
      paediatric population. The aim was to identify causal mutations in genes
      implicated in SRNS within a South African paediatric population. We enrolled 118 
      children with primary nephrotic syndrome (NS), 70 SRNS and 48 steroid-sensitive
      NS. All children with SRNS underwent kidney biopsy. We first genotyped the NPHS2 
      gene for the p.V260E variant in all NS cases (n = 118) and controls (n = 219). To
      further identify additional variants, we performed whole-exome sequencing and
      interrogated ten genes (NPHS1, NPHS2, WT1, LAMB2, ACTN4, TRPC6, INF2, CD2AP,
      PLCE1, MYO1E) implicated in SRNS with histopathological features of focal
      segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) in 56 SRNS cases and 29 controls; we also
      performed exome sequencing on two patients carrying the NPHS2 p.V260E mutation as
      positive controls. The overall detection rate of causal and putative pathogenic
      mutations in children with SRNS was 27/70 (39%): 15 (21%) carried the NPHS2
      p.V260E causal mutation in the homozygous state, and 12 (17%) SRNS cases carried 
      a putative pathogenic mutation in the heterozygous state in genes (INF2 (n = 8), 
      CD2AP (n = 3) and TRPC6 (n = 1)) known to have autosomal dominant inheritance
      mode. NPHS2 p.V260E homozygosity was specifically associated with biopsy-proven
      FSGS, accounting for 24% of children of Black ethnicity (15 of 63) with
      steroid-resistant FSGS. No causal or putative pathogenic mutations were
      identified in NPHS1, WT1, LAMB2, PLCE1, MYO1E and ACTN4. We report four novel
      variants in INF2, PLCE1, ACTN4 and TRPC6. Conclusion: We report putative missense
      variants predicted to be pathogenic in INF2, CD2AP and TRPC6 among
      steroid-resistant-FSGS children. However, the NPHS2 p.V260E mutation is a
      prevalent cause of steroid-resistant FSGS among Black South African children
      occurring in 24% of children with SRNS. Screening all Black African children
      presenting with NS for NPHS2 p.V260E will provide a precision diagnosis of
      steroid-resistant FSGS and inform clinical management. What is Known: * Limited
      data is available on the genetic disparity of SNRS in a South African paediatric 
      setting. * The high rate of steroid resistance in Black South African children
      with FSGS compared to other racial groups is partially explained by the founder
      variant NPHS2 p.V260E. What is New: * We report putative missense variants
      predicted to be pathogenic in INF2, CD2AP and TRPC6 among steroid-resistant FSGS 
      children. * NPHS2 p.V260E mutation remains a prevalent cause of steroid-resistant
      FSGS among Black South African children, demonstrating precision diagnostic
      utility.

TI  - Clinical significance and interrelations of PD-L1 expression, Ki-67 index, and
      molecular alterations in sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma from a Chinese
      population.
LID - 10.1007/s00428-022-03390-9 [doi]
AB  - Immunotherapy shows prospects in treating advanced medullary thyroid carcinoma
      although controversial reports are present. Recently, histological grading has
      been applied to medullary thyroid carcinoma by the Ki-67 index, mitotic figures, 
      and tumor necrosis. However, the interrelation of PD-L1 expression, the Ki-67
      index, and major genetic alterations of sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma has 
      not been fully reported. We examined the expression of PD-L1 (SP142 and 22C3) and
      the Ki-67 index immunohistologically and detected the major genetic alterations
      by next-generation sequencing in a cohort of sporadic medullary thyroid
      carcinomas, studied their survival impact, and discussed their interrelation. We 
      identified that a high Ki-67 index (> 2%) and positive RET M918T mutation were
      correlated with poor disease-free survival but were not correlated with PD-L1
      expression. All PD-L1 positive tumors were RET M918T mutation negative, and PD-L1
      expression was positively correlated with HRAS mutation. The Ki-67 index was
      correlated with neither PD-L1 expression nor major genetic alterations. Our
      results indicate that immunotherapy targeting PD-L1/PD-1 might be more effective 
      for patients with sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma harboring HRAS mutations.

TI  - Standardized right artery first approach during laparoscopic
      pancreaticoduodenectomy for periampullary neoplasms: technical aspects and
      perioperative outcomes.
LID - 10.1007/s00464-022-09494-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The most debated aspects of laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy
      (LPD) concern the dissection of the pancreas from the surrounding vessels and the
      achievement of adequate resection margins, especially in patients with pancreatic
      cancer. METHODS: Data of consecutive patients undergoing LPD with right artery
      first approach from September 2020 to September 2021 for periampullary neoplasms 
      (pancreatic, ampullary, duodenal, distal common biliary duct) were prospectively 
      collected and retrospectively analyzed. The overall cohort was divided into two
      groups: patients affected by pancreatic carcinoma (PC) and patients affected by
      other periampullary neoplasms (OP). Surgical and postoperative outcomes between
      PC and OP were compared. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients (15 PC and 16 OP) were
      selected. No difference was found between PC and OP in terms of baseline
      characteristics. Median resection time and overall surgical time of the entire
      cohort were 275 min and 530 min, respectively, without difference between the
      groups (p = 0.599 and 0.052, respectively). Blood loss was similar between the
      groups, being 350 ml in PC and 325 ml in OP (p = 0.762). One patient (3.2%) was
      converted to laparotomy. No difference was found between the groups in terms of
      pathological outcomes. Median number of retrieved lymph nodes was 17. The
      majority of the patients (83.9%) received an R0 resection (73.3% and 93.7% in PC 
      and OP, respectively; p = 0.172). Postoperative surgical outcomes did not differ 
      between the groups, excepting for overall complication rate that was higher in
      the OP group (26.7% vs 68.7% in PC and OP, respectively; p = 0.032). CONCLUSION: 
      Standardized right artery first approach during LPD was feasible and did not show
      worse surgical and postoperative outcomes in patients with pancreatic cancer as
      compared to those affected by other periampullary neoplasms, except for a higher 
      rate of minor complications.

TI  - Colorectal cancer risk of flat low-grade dysplasia in inflammatory bowel disease:
      a systematic review and proportion meta-analysis.
LID - 10.1007/s00464-022-09462-w [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To date, the optimal management of patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD) and flat low-grade dysplasia (fLGD) of the colon or rectum remains 
      controversial. METHODS: A systematic review was reported in accordance with
      PRISMA 2020 (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses).
      Patients diagnosed with fLGD on surveillance endoscopy were pooled from studies
      published between 2000 and 2020. Advanced neoplasia was defined by the presence
      of HGD, CRC or small bowel adenocarcinoma detected on subsequent surveillance
      endoscopy or from examination of resection specimens. We estimated the pooled
      annual incidence rate of colorectal cancer (CRC) and advanced neoplasia, and the 
      risk factors associated with neoplastic progression. RESULTS: We identified 24
      articles and 738 IBD patients were diagnosed with fLGD on endoscopy. Two hundred 
      thirty-six patients (32%) underwent immediate surgery with surgical specimens
      demonstrating CRC in 8 patients (pooled prevalence, 8.66%; 95% CI 3.58-19.46) and
      HGD (high grade dysplasia) in 11 patients (pooled prevalence, 13.97%; 95% CI
      5.65-30.65). Five hundred-two patients (68%) underwent endoscopic surveillance
      with 63 patients with fLGD progressing to advanced neoplasia during endoscopic
      surveillance (38 HGD, 24 CRC and one patient developing small bowel
      adenocarcinoma). The mean duration of follow-up after fLGD diagnosis was 71
      months (10.9-212). The pooled incidence of CRC and advanced neoplasia was 0.5
      (95% CI 0.23-0.77) and 1.71 per 100 patient-year (95% CI 0.88-2.54) respectively.
      The use of corticosteroids and location of fLGD in the distal colon were
      significantly associated with neoplastic progression. CONCLUSIONS: This study
      provides a summary incidence rate of CRC and advanced neoplasia in patients with 
      IBD and fLGD to inform surgeons' and endoscopists' decision-making thus reducing 
      potential ineffective treatments.

TI  - The use of near-infrared autofluorescence during total laryngectomy with hemi- or
      total thyroidectomy.
LID - 10.1007/s00405-022-07584-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to describe the use of near-infrared
      autofluorescence (NIR-AF) to identify and preserve parathyroid glands (PGs) in a 
      group of patients with advanced hypopharyngeal/laryngeal cancer undergone total
      (pharyngo)laryngectomy with hemi- or total thyroidectomy. METHODS: At San
      Raffaele Hospital, Milan (Italy), from January 2021 to May 2021, 7 patients
      affected by cT4a laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) underwent surgery using 
      an autofluorescence detection system (Fluobeam-Fluoptics((R))). For proper
      surgical planning, the demolition phase envisaged extension of the intervention
      to 4 hemithyroidectomies and 3 total thyroidectomies associated, respectively,
      with homolateral or bilateral CCND. Serum calcium, ionized calcium, and
      parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels at post-operative day (POD) 1 and 2 and at 2
      weeks after surgery were monitored. Finally, we compared the data obtained with a
      cohort of patients who underwent surgery without the adoption of NIR-AF. RESULTS:
      With the use of NIR-AF, 18/20 PGs were identified, of which 7/18 were preserved
      exclusively thanks to the use of autoflorescence. The technique also made it
      possible to identify and isolate three PGs from the surgical specimen, which were
      subsequently transplanted only after intraoperative histological confirmation. On
      POD-1, 3/7 patients (42.8%) were hypocalcemic; on POD-2 and after 2 weeks only
      1/7 patient (14.2%) was hypocalcemic. Comparing the two groups, we highlighted
      that the utilization of NIR-AF was related to a significant decrease of median
      serum (p = 0.026) and ionized calcium levels (p = 0.017) 2 weeks after surgery.
      Using this new technology, in no case did definitive histological examination
      reveal the presence of PGs in the surgical specimen, reaching an accuracy of
      100%. CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort of patients who underwent total
      (pharyngo)laryngectomy with hemi- or total thyroidectomy, the use of
      near-infrared autofluorescence improved medium term postoperative hypocalcemia
      rates. This new technology helps to achieve a better calcemic outcome compared to
      the standard naked eye approach, since it helps the surgeon to identify and
      preserve parathyroid glandular tissue with a lower incidence of post-operative
      hypocalcemia.

TI  - dN/dS-H, a New Test to Distinguish Different Selection Modes in Protein Evolution
      and Cancer Evolution.
LID - 10.1007/s00239-022-10064-2 [doi]
AB  - One of the most popular measures in the analysis of protein sequence evolution is
      the ratio of nonsynonymous distance (dN) to synonymous distance (dS). Under the
      assumption that synonymous substitutions in the coding region are selectively
      neutral, the dN/dS ratio can be used to statistically detect the adaptive
      evolution (or purifying selection) if dN/dS > 1 (or dN/dS < 1) significantly.
      However, due to strong structural constraints and/or variable functional
      constraints imposed on amino acid sites, most encoding genes in most species have
      demonstrated dN/dS < 1. Consequently, the statistical power for testing dN/dS = 1
      may be insufficient to distinguish between different selection modes. In this
      paper, we propose a more powerful test, called dN/dS-H, in which a new parameter 
      H, a relative measure of rate variation among sites, was introduced. Given the
      condition of strong purifying selections at some sites, the dN/dS-H model
      predicts dN/dS = 1-H for neutral evolution, dN/dS < 1-H for nearly neutral
      selection, and dN/dS > 1-H for adaptive evolution. The potential of this new
      method for resolving the neutral-adaptive debates is illustrated by the protein
      sequence evolution in vertebrates, Drosophila and yeasts, as well as somatic
      cancer evolution (specialized as the CN/CS-H test).

TI  - Swedish Normative Scores for the BREAST-Q Reduction/Mastopexy Module.
LID - 10.1007/s00266-022-03025-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Norm values for patient reported outcomes, that is knowledge about
      how the general population of women rate their breast-related satisfaction and
      quality of life, are necessary to interpret the meaning of scores. The aims of
      this study were to create Swedish normative values for the BREAST-Q
      reduction/mastopexy module and to describe what healthy women are most
      satisfied/dissatisfied with regarding their breasts. METHODS: A random sample of 
      400 women aged 18-80, currently living in Region Vastra Gotaland, were sent
      BREAST-Q reduction/mastopexy. Descriptive data are presented. RESULTS: One
      hundred and forty-six women answered the questionnaire (36.5%). Mean total scores
      ranged from 48 to 78. No clear changes in scores could be seen with age and women
      with a high BMI seem to be less satisfied with their breasts. The participants
      were most satisfied with the appearance of the breasts when dressed, the
      appearance in the mirror dressed, the shape of the breasts with bra, and symmetry
      of size and most dissatisfied with appearance in the mirror naked and the shape
      of the breasts without a bra. Thirty to forty-five per cent of healthy women
      never or almost never feel sexually attractive. Among physical symptoms often
      described in breast hypertrophy, the most common among healthy women were lack of
      energy, pain in the neck, arms and shoulders, headache and difficulty performing 
      intense physical activity. CONCLUSION: The norms for BREAST-Q reduction/mastopexy
      add another piece to the puzzle to what constitutes normal breast satisfaction
      and how surgical outcomes can be evaluated. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE IV: This journal
      requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article. For a full

TI  - EPAS1 Promoter Hypermethylation is a Diagnostic and Prognostic Biomarker for
      Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.
LID - 10.1089/gtmb.2021.0305 [doi]
AB  - Background: The importance of promoter methylation in non-small cell lung cancers
      (NSCLCs) remains to be understood. Thus, we aimed to determine the diagnostic and
      prognostic value of methylation of the endothelial Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS)
      domain-containing protein 1 (EPAS1) promoter in NSCLC. Materials and Methods:
      EPAS1 promoter methylation levels were quantitated by a methylation-specific
      polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, we evaluated the expression, promoter
      methylation, prognostic value, and impact on immune cell infiltration of EPAS1 by
      analyzing TCGA database or by web-based bioinformatics tools such as GEPIA,
      UALCAN, and MethSurv. Results: Our results demonstrated that promoter methylation
      of EPAS1 downregulated its expression in NSCLC tissues. Additionally, an area
      under the curve value of 0.772 indicated that methylation of the EPAS1 promoter
      is a potential diagnostic marker for NSCLC. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated
      that high methylation levels of CpG sites in the EPAS1 promoter were indicative
      of worse overall survival (OS). Furthermore, EPAS1 expression levels were
      strongly correlated with infiltration of several types of immune cells, for
      instance, gammadelta T cells, T follicular helper cells, CD8+ T cells, and CD4+ T
      cells. Conclusions: Collectively, our findings demonstrated that methylation of
      the EPAS1 promoter is a promising prognostic biomarker for NSCLC and EPAS1
      potentially plays an important role in immune cell infiltration in NSCLC.

TI  - Mismatch Repair and Microsatellite Instability Testing for Immune Checkpoint
      Inhibitor Therapy.
LID - 10.5858/arpa.2021-0632-CP [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT.-: The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved immune checkpoint
      inhibitor therapy for patients with advanced solid tumors that have DNA mismatch 
      repair defects or high levels of microsatellite instability; however, the FDA
      provided no guidance on which specific clinical assays should be used to
      determine mismatch repair status. OBJECTIVE.-: To develop an evidence-based
      guideline to identify the optimal clinical laboratory test to identify defects in
      DNA mismatch repair in patients with solid tumor malignancies who are being
      considered for immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. DESIGN.-: The College of
      American Pathologists convened an expert panel to perform a systematic review of 
      the literature and develop recommendations. Using the National Academy of
      Medicine-endorsed Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and
      Evaluation approach, the recommendations were derived from available evidence,
      strength of that evidence, open comment feedback, and expert panel consensus.
      Mismatch repair immunohistochemistry, microsatellite instability derived from
      both polymerase chain reaction and next-generation sequencing, and tumor mutation
      burden derived from large panel next-generation sequencing were within scope.
      RESULTS.-: Six recommendations and 3 good practice statements were developed.
      More evidence and evidence of higher quality were identified for colorectal
      cancer and other cancers of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract than for cancers
      arising outside the GI tract. CONCLUSIONS.-: An optimal assay depends on cancer
      type. For most cancer types outside of the GI tract and the endometrium, there
      was insufficient published evidence to recommend a specific clinical assay.
      Absent published evidence, immunohistochemistry is an acceptable approach readily
      available in most clinical laboratories.

TI  - Prognostic Impact of Lymphocyte-to-C-Reactive Protein Ratio in Patients Who
      Underwent Surgical Resection for Pancreatic Cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence indicates that increased systemic inflammation is
      correlated with poorer cancer-specific survival in various cancer types. This
      study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of various combinations of
      inflammatory factors in patients who underwent surgical resection for pancreatic 
      cancer (PC). METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 97 consecutive patients with PC
      who underwent pancreatectomy. We assessed the predictive impact for recurrence
      using a combination of 5 inflammatory markers and focused on the
      lymphocyte-C-reactive protein ratio (LCR) to elucidate its prognostic and
      predictive value for recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) in 
      univariate and multivariate analyses using the Cox proportional hazards model.
      RESULTS: Low preoperative LCR was correlated with low serum hemoglobin, low serum
      albumin concentration, high frequency of microscopic vascular invasion, and high 
      frequency of microscopic perineural invasion. The low LCR group had significantly
      worse RFS and OS. Lower preoperative LCR was an independent predictor of shorter 
      RFS and OS in this cohort. DISCUSSION: Preoperative LCR is a novel and convenient
      prognostic marker for patients with PC. Patients with low LCR may require more
      favorable intensive therapy.

TI  - LncRNA A2M-AS1 promotes ferroptosis in pancreatic cancer via interacting with
      PCBP3.
LID - MCR-22-0024 [pii]
LID - 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-22-0024 [doi]
AB  - Ferroptosis is a newly-discovered cell death mechanism involved in the
      progression of various tumors, the role of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in it was
      relatively less explored. This study identified the low levels of a recently
      studied long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), A2M-AS1, in pancreatic cancer (PC) and
      suggested its positive correlation with the overall survival time of PC patients.
      A2M-AS1 was mainly localized in the cytoplasm, inhibiting the cellular
      proliferation, migration, and invasion as well as the tumor growth of the PC
      cells. Moreover, the Erastin-induced ferroptosis increased the expression levels 
      of A2M-AS1. The overexpression of A2M-AS1 promoted ferroptosis in the PC, which
      was inhibited by the silencing of A2M-AS1. Mechanically, A2M-AS1 could directly
      interact with the poly (rC) binding protein 3 (PCBP3), which plays an important
      role in the process of iron metabolism, thereby promoting the ferroptosis in PC. 
      In addition, the A2M-AS1/PCBP3 axis could facilitate the p38 activation and
      inhibit the phosphorylation of the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway; all these
      participate in regulating ferroptosis. In conclusion, the regulation of
      ferroptosis by targeting the A2M-AS1/PCBP3 axis might provide a novel target for 
      the treatment of PC in the future. Implications: A2M-AS1 might be a potential
      novel therapeutic target for PC patients in the future.

AB  - A convenient three-component synthetic approach was developed en route to new and
      significative N-arylated-dihydrobenzo[g]quinoline-5,10-diones using
      2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, a variety of aromatic aldehydes, and
      4-(arylamino)furan-2(5H)-ones. A sequence of steps including Knoevenagel
      condensation, Michael addition, [1,3]-hydrogen shift, intramolecular cyclization 
      and dehydration led to the formation of products. All the products were
      structurally characterized by spectroscopic techniques and assessed in terms of
      their cytotoxicity profile against four cancer cell lines (KB, HepG2, A549, and
      MCF7), and human embryonic kidney (Hek-293) cell lines.

TI  - Real-world effectiveness of nivolumab plus ipilimumab and second-line therapy in 
      Japanese untreated patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma: 2-year analysis
      from a multicenter retrospective clinical study (J-cardinal study).
LID - hyac124 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jjco/hyac124 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nivolumab plus ipilimumab combination therapy is one of the standard 
      therapies for untreated renal cell carcinoma patients with an International
      Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium intermediate/poor risk. We
      have previously reported the 1-year analysis results of the effectiveness and
      safety of nivolumab plus ipilimumab combination therapy in the real-world setting
      in Japan. Here, we report the effectiveness of nivolumab plus ipilimumab
      combination therapy and of second-line therapy, using 2-year analysis. METHODS:
      This retrospective observational study enrolled Japanese patients with previously
      untreated metastatic renal cell carcinoma who initiated nivolumab plus ipilimumab
      combination therapy between August 2018 and January 2019. Data were collected
      from patients' medical records at baseline and at 3 months, 1 year and 2 years
      after the last enrollment. RESULTS: Of the 45 patients enrolled, 10 patients
      (22.2%) each had non-clear cell renal cell carcinoma and Eastern Cooperative
      Oncology Group performance status >/=2 at baseline. Median follow-up period was
      24.0 months; objective response rate was 41.5%, with 6 patients achieving
      complete response; median progression-free survival was 17.8 months and 24-month 
      progression-free survival and overall survival rates were 41.6 and 59.1%,
      respectively. Second-line therapy achieved an objective response rate of 20%;
      median progression-free survival was 9.8 months. Median progression-free survival
      2 was 26.4 months. CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of nivolumab plus ipilimumab
      combination therapy at 2-year analysis in the real-world setting in Japan was
      comparable to that reported in CheckMate 214. The current analysis also
      demonstrated the effectiveness of second-line therapy after nivolumab plus
      ipilimumab combination therapy.

TI  - Posttreatment FDG-PET/CT Hopkins criteria predict locoregional recurrence after
      definitive radiotherapy for oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.
LID - 10.1002/hed.27160 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Metabolic response assessment for oropharyngeal squamous cell
      carcinoma (OPSCC) aids in identifying locoregional persistence/recurrence (LRR). 
      The Hopkins Criteria are a standardized qualitative response assessment system
      using posttreatment FDG-PET/CT. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort
      study of patients with node-positive OPSCC treated with definitive
      (chemo)radiotherapy. We assessed Hopkins Criteria performance for LRR, then
      developed and validated a competing-risks model. RESULTS: Between 2004 and 2018, 
      259 patients were included with median follow-up of 43 months. The Hopkins
      Criteria sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and accuracy were
      68%, 88%, 95%, and 85%. The 36-month cumulative incidence of LRR was greater with
      positive scores (45% vs. 5%, HR 12.60, p < 0.001). PET/CTs performed </=10 weeks 
      after radiotherapy were associated with a four-fold increase in pathologically
      negative biopsies/surgeries (36% vs. 9%, p = 0.03). The AUC for LRR was 0.89
      using a model integrating the Hopkins score. CONCLUSIONS: The Hopkins Criteria
      predict LRR with high accuracy for OPSCC response assessment.

TI  - Results of NC-6300 (Nanoparticle Epirubicin) in an Expansion Cohort of Patients
      with Angiosarcoma.
LID - oyac155 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/oncolo/oyac155 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: NC-6300 is a novel epirubicin (EPI) drug conjugated polymeric micelle
      developed using cutting-edge micellar nanoparticle technology. The nanoparticle
      epirubicin conjugates EPI to a polymer via a pH-sensitive linker which enables
      the selective EPI release into tumor. Tumor activity was observed in a
      monotherapy phase Ib trial, where two of two patients with angiosarcoma achieved 
      a partial response. To further explore the activity of NC-6300 in angiosarcoma,
      an expansion cohort was undertaken. METHODS: Ten patients with angiosarcoma were 
      enrolled in the expansion cohort. Patients were dosed using the recommended dose 
      of 150 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) once every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was
      progression-free survival. RESULTS: The most common adverse events (AEs) of any
      grade, regardless of the causal relationship with NC-6300, were neutropenia
      (90%), fatigue, and thrombocytopenia (60% each) and nausea (50%). The most common
      grades 3 and 4 AEs were neutropenia (80%), thrombocytopenia (40%), and anemia and
      leukopenia (20% each). The median progression-free survival (mPFS) for all
      subjects was 5.4 months. The mPFS was 3.8 months in subjects with prior
      anthracycline treatment and 8.2 months in subjects without prior anthracycline
      treatment. CONCLUSION: NC-6300 was well tolerated, showing promising activity in 
      angiosarcoma patients without prior anthracycline treatment. NC-6300 warrants
      further investigation (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03168061).

LID - jkac185 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/g3journal/jkac185 [doi]
AB  - Chromoanagenesis is a catastrophic event that involves localized chromosomal
      shattering and reorganization. In this study, we report a case of
      chromoanagenesis resulting from defective meiosis in the MEIOTIC ASYNAPTIC MUTANT
      1 (asy1) background in Arabidopsis thaliana. We provide a detailed
      characterization of the genomic structure of this individual with a severely
      shattered segment of chromosome 1. We identified 260 novel DNA junctions in the
      affected region, most of which affect gene sequence on one, or both sides of the 
      junction. Our results confirm that asy1-related defective meiosis is a potential 
      trigger for chromoanagenesis. This is the first example of chromoanagenesis
      associated with female meiosis and indicates the potential for genome evolution
      during oogenesis.

TI  - Identification of bacteriophage genome sequences with representation learning.
LID - btac509 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btac509 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Bacteriophages/Phages are the viruses that infect and replicate
      within bacteria and archaea. Phages are used to therapeutically provide another
      potential solution for solving antibiotic resistance, which is one of the threats
      to global health. To develop phage therapies, the identification of phages from
      metagenome sequences is the first step. Currently, there are two main methods for
      identifying phages: database-based (alignment-based) methods and alignment-free
      methods. Database-based methods typically use a large number of sequences as
      references; alignment-free methods usually learn the features of the sequences
      with machine learning and deep learning models. RESULTS: We propose INHERIT which
      use a deep representation learning model to integrate both database-based and
      alignment-free methods, combining the strengths of both. Pre-training is used as 
      an alternative way of acquiring knowledge representations from existing
      databases, while the BERT-style deep learning framework retains the advantage of 
      alignment-free methods. We compare INHERIT with four existing methods on a
      third-party benchmark dataset. Our experiments show that INHERIT achieves a
      better performance with the F1-score of 0.9932. In addition, we find that
      pre-training two species separately helps the non-alignment deep learning model
      make more accurate predictions. AVAILABILITY: The codes of INHERIT are now
      available in: https://github.com/Celestial-Bai/INHERIT. SUPPLEMENTARY
      INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

      elderly advanced gastric cancer patients; retrospective cohort study.
LID - hyac126 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jjco/hyac126 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It remains unclear whether laparoscopic gastrectomy with optimal
      lymphadenectomy is appropriate for very elderly patients with advanced gastric
      cancer. This study aimed to assess the validity of laparoscopic gastrectomy with 
      D1+ lymphadenectomy performed for advanced gastric cancer in patients aged 80
      years or more. METHODS: Included in this retrospective study were 122 patients
      who underwent curative laparoscopic gastrectomy for advanced gastric cancer
      between 2013 and 2018. All patients over 80 years old underwent laparoscopic
      gastrectomy with D1+ lymphadenectomy. We divided patients by age between those
      who were very elderly (age >/= 80 years; very elderly group [n = 57]) and those
      who were non-very elderly (age < 80 years; control group [n = 65]), and we
      compared patient and clinicopathological characteristics, intraoperative
      outcomes, and short- and long-term outcomes between the two groups. We also
      performed multivariate analyses to identify predictors of postoperative
      prognosis. RESULTS: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status of
      grade 2 or higher and mean Charlson comorbidity index score and body mass index
      were significantly different between the very elderly group and the control
      group. Adjuvant chemotherapy was used in relatively few very elderly group
      patients. Operation time, blood loss volume, and postoperative morbidity and
      mortality did not differ between the two groups. The overall survival and
      disease-specific survival rate of very elderly group patients with the Charlson
      comorbidity index score of <3 was not significantly different from that of the
      control group patients. CONCLUSION: The treatment of advanced gastric cancer by
      laparoscopic gastrectomy with D1+ lymphadenectomy to be both safe and effective
      in the very elderly group patients with the Charlson comorbidity index score of
      <3.

TI  - Dermoscopy as response evaluation tool for cutaneous malignant melanoma
      metastases treated with Talimogene Laherparepvec: a prospective feasibility
      study.
LID - 10.1111/jdv.18479 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently, the response of cutaneous melanoma metastases (CMM) to
      treatment with Talimogene Laherparepvec (T-VEC) is evaluated by clinical
      examination, macroscopic lesion photography and 3-monthly PET-CT scans. When a
      complete response (CR) is suspected, biopsies are taken for histopathological
      confirmation. OBJECTIVES: We set out to investigate the feasibility of dermoscopy
      in monitoring the response to T-VEC in a pilot study. METHODS: Six patients with 
      CMM treated with T-VEC monotherapy were enrolled in the pilot study. Patients
      were treated with T-VEC according to protocol and the response was monitored with
      clinical examination, macroscopic lesion photography and 3-monthly PET-CT scans. 
      For this study, 1-3 cutaneous metastases per patient were selected. Macroscopic
      and dermoscopic pictures of these metastases were taken at baseline, prior to
      each treatment with T-VEC and prior to histological biopsy. The pictures were
      evaluated by two investigators, using a color-based pattern classification.
      RESULTS: In total 11 CMM were dermoscopically assessed, 93% was located on the
      extremities. Four metastases had a blue pattern, two metastases had a pink
      pattern, three metastases had a brown pattern and two metastases had mixed
      pattern. Metastases with a pink pattern harbored glomerular and arborizing
      vessels that diminished and vanished during treatment T-VEC, indicating CR. The
      remaining metastases did not show changes on a dermoscopic level that were not
      also seen on macroscopic level. Five patients achieved CR to T-VEC, one patient
      is still on treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that for CMM with a
      pink pattern, dermoscopy can provide additional information regarding the
      response to T-VEC. For cutaneous metastases with a blue, brown or a mixed
      pattern, dermoscopy did not provide additional information on top of the
      information obtained through physical examination and lesion photography. More
      studies would be needed to determine the exact role of dermoscopy in the
      evaluation of CMM.

TI  - (15)N-Detected TROSY NMR experiments to study large disordered proteins in
      high-field magnets.
LID - 10.1039/d2cc02005j [doi]
AB  - Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of proteins are critical in the
      regulation of biological processes but difficult to study structurally. Nuclear
      magnetic resonance (NMR) is uniquely equipped to provide structural information
      on IDRs at atomic resolution; however, existing NMR methods often pose a
      challenge for large molecular weight IDRs. Resonance assignment of IDRs using
      (15)N(D)-detection was previously demonstrated and shown to overcome some of
      these limitations. Here, we improve the methodology by overcoming the need for
      deuterated buffers and provide better sensitivity and resolution at higher
      magnetic fields and physiological salt concentrations using transverse relaxation
      optimized spectroscopy (TROSY). Finally, large disordered regions with low
      sequence complexity can be assigned efficiently using these new methods as
      demonstrated by achieving near complete assignment of the 398-residue N-terminal 
      IDR of the transcription factor NFAT1 harboring 18% prolines.

TI  - Key risk factors for the relative and absolute 5-year risk of cancer to enhance
      cancer screening and prevention.
LID - 10.1002/cncr.34396 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study identifies populations who may benefit most from expanded 
      cancer screening. METHODS: Two American Cancer Society prospective cohort
      studies, Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition Cohort and Cancer Prevention
      Study-3, were used to identify the risk factors associated with a > 2% absolute
      risk of any cancer within 5 years. In total, 429,991 participants with no prior
      personal history of cancer were followed for cancer for up to 5 years.
      Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios
      and 95% confidence intervals for association. By using these hazard ratios,
      individualized coherent absolute risk estimation was used to calculate absolute
      risks by age. RESULTS: Overall, 15,226 invasive cancers were diagnosed among
      participants within 5 years of enrollment. The multivariable-adjusted relative
      risk of any cancer was strongest for current smokers compared with never-smokers.
      In men, alcohol intake, family history of cancer, red meat consumption, and
      physical inactivity were also associated with risk (p < .05). In women, body mass
      index, type 2 diabetes, hysterectomy, parity, family history of cancer,
      hypertension, tubal ligation, and physical inactivity were associated (p < .05). 
      The absolute 5-year risk exceeded 2% among nearly all participants older than 50 
      years and among some participants younger than 50 years, including current or
      former smokers (<30 years since quitting) and long-term nonsmokers with a body
      mass index >25 kg/m(2) or a first-degree family history of cancer. The absolute
      5-year risk was as high as 29% in men and 25% in women. CONCLUSIONS: Older age
      and smoking were the two most important risk factors associated with the relative
      and absolute 5-year risk of developing any cancer.

TI  - Levels of evidence for the association between different food groups/items
      consumption and the risk of various cancer sites: an umbrella review.
PG  - 1-14
LID - 10.1080/09637486.2022.2103523 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to determine the level of evidence on the association between
      food groups/items consumption and the risk of different cancer sites from the
      meta-analyses/pooled analyses of observational studies. A systematic search was
      executed in Scopus, PubMed/MEDLINE, and Web of Science. The criteria from the
      World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research (WCRF/AICR)
      Expert Report were adopted for evidence grading. In summary, there was convincing
      evidence for the association between fibre intake and decreased risk of colon and
      breast cancer. Also, consumption of dairy products, milk, fruits, and fibre was
      associated with a probable decreased risk of breast cancer. Consumption of whole 
      grains, dairy products, milk, fruits, vegetables, and fibre had a probable
      inverse association with the incidence risk of gastrointestinal tract cancers.
      More qualified studies are needed to find reliable findings on the association
      between various food groups/items consumption and the risk of different cancer
      sites.

TI  - Inhibition of LSD1 with bomedemstat sensitizes small cell lung cancer to immune
      checkpoint blockade and T cell killing.
LID - CCR-22-1128 [pii]
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-22-1128 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The addition of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) to platinum/etoposide
      chemotherapy changed the standard of care for small cell lung cancer (SCLC)
      treatment. However, ICB addition only modestly improved clinical outcomes, likely
      reflecting the high prevalence of an immunologically "cold" tumor
      microenvironment in SCLC, despite high mutational burden. Nevertheless, some
      patients clearly benefit from ICB and recent reports have associated clinical
      responses to ICB in SCLC with A) decreased neuroendocrine characteristics and B) 
      activation of NOTCH signaling. We previously showed that inhibition of the LSD1
      demethylase activates NOTCH and suppresses neuroendocrine features of SCLC,
      leading us to investigate whether LSD1 inhibition would enhance the response to
      PD1 inhibition in SCLC. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We employed a syngeneic
      immunocompetent model of SCLC, derived from a genetically engineered mouse model 
      harboring Rb1/Trp53 inactivation, to investigate combining the LSD1 inhibitor
      bomedemstat with anti-PD1 therapy. In vivo experiments were complemented by
      cell-based studies in murine and human models. RESULTS: Bomedemstat potentiated
      responses to PD1 inhibition in a syngeneic model of SCLC, resulting in increased 
      CD8+ T cell infiltration and strong tumor growth inhibition. Bomedemstat
      increased MHC class I expression in mouse SCLC tumor cells in vivo and augmented 
      MHC-I induction by interferon- and increased killing by tumor specific T cells in
      cell culture. CONCLUSIONS: LSD1 inhibition increased MHC-I expression and
      enhanced responses to PD1 inhibition in vivo, supporting a new clinical trial to 
      combine bomedemstat with standard of care PD1 axis inhibition in SCLC.

TI  - Virtual Screening in the Cloud Identifies Potent and Selective ROS1 Kinase
      Inhibitors.
LID - 10.1021/acs.jcim.2c00644 [doi]
AB  - ROS1 rearrangements account for 1-2% of non-small cell lung cancer patients, yet 
      there are no specifically designed, selective ROS1 therapies in the clinic.
      Previous knowledge of potent ROS1 inhibitors with selectivity over TrkA, a
      selected antitarget, enabled virtual screening as a hit finding approach in this 
      project. The ligand-based virtual screening was focused on identifying molecules 
      with a similar 3D shape and pharmacophore to the known actives. To that end, we
      turned to the AstraZeneca virtual library, estimated to cover 10(15)
      synthesizable make-on-demand molecules. We used cloud computing-enabled FastROCS 
      technology to search the enumerated 10(10) subset of the full virtual space. A
      small number of specific libraries were prioritized based on the compound
      properties and a medicinal chemistry assessment and further enumerated with
      available building blocks. Following the docking evaluation to the ROS1
      structure, the most promising hits were synthesized and tested, resulting in the 
      identification of several potent and selective series. The best among them gave a
      nanomolar ROS1 inhibitor with over 1000-fold selectivity over TrkA and, from the 
      preliminary established SAR, these have the potential to be further optimized.
      Our prospective study describes how conceptually simple shape-matching approaches
      can identify potent and selective compounds by searching ultralarge virtual
      libraries, demonstrating the applicability of such workflows and their importance
      in early drug discovery.

TI  - REBOA: Expanding Applications from Traumatic Hemorrhage to Obstetrics and
      Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation, From the AJR Special Series on Emergency
      Radiology.
LID - 10.2214/AJR.22.27932 [doi]
AB  - Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) has emerged
      over the past decade as a technique to control life-threatening hemorrhage and
      treat hemorrhagic shock, being increasingly used to treat noncompressible
      traumatic torso hemorrhage. Reports during this time also support the use of the 
      REBOA device for an expanding range of indications including non-traumatic
      abdominal hemorrhage, postpartum hemorrhage, placenta accreta spectrum disorder
      (PAS), and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The strongest available evidence 
      supports REBOA as a lifesaving adjunct to definitive surgical management in
      trauma and as a method to help prevent hysterectomy in select patients with
      postpartum hemorrhage or PAS. In comparison with initial descriptions of complete
      REBOA inflation, techniques for partial REBOA inflation have been introduced to
      achieve hemodynamic stability while minimizing adverse events relating to
      reperfusion injuries. Fluoroscopy-free REBOA has been described in various
      settings, including trauma, obstetrics, and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. As
      use of REBOA expands outside of the trauma setting and into non-traumatic
      abdominal hemorrhage, obstetrics, and CPR, it is imperative for radiologists to
      become familiar with this technology, its proper placement, and its potential
      adverse sequela.

TI  - Prevalence of Malignancy in Adrenal Nodules with Heterogeneous Microscopic Fat on
      Chemical-Shift MRI: A Multiinstitutional Study.
LID - 10.2214/AJR.22.27976 [doi]
AB  - Background: Homogeneous microscopic fat within adrenal nodules on chemical shift 
      MRI (CS-MRI) is diagnostic of benign adrenal adenoma, but the clinical relevance 
      of heterogeneous microscopic fat is not well established. Objective: This study
      sought to determine prevalence of malignancy in adrenal nodules with
      heterogeneous microscopic fat on dual-echo T1-weighted CS-MRI. Methods: We
      performed a seven-institution retrospective study of adult patients with adrenal 
      nodules detected on MRI between August 2007 and November 2020. Eligible nodules
      were 10 mm or larger in short-axis diameter with heterogeneous microscopic fat (<
      80% area of signal loss on opposed-phase CS-MRI). Two radiologists from each
      center, blinded to reference standard results, determined signal-loss patterns
      (diffuse, two distinct parts, speckling pattern, central loss, or peripheral
      loss) within nodules. Reference standards were available for 283 nodules
      (pathology, 21; imaging follow-up for >/= 1 year, 245; or clinical follow-up for 
      >/= 5 years, 17) in 282 patients (mean age, 60 +/- 12 years; 172 women, 110 men);
      30% (86/282) had prior malignancy. Results: Mean long-axis diameter was 18.7 +/- 
      7.9 mm (range, 10-80 mm). No malignant nodules were found in patients without
      prior cancer (0/197; 95% CI, 0-1.5%). Four of the 86 patients with prior
      malignancy (hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC], renal cell carcinoma [RCC], lung
      cancer, and both colon cancer and RCC) had metastatic nodules (4.7%; 95% CI,
      1.3-11.5%). Detected patterns were diffuse heterogeneous signal loss (40%,
      114/283), speckling (28%, 80/283), two distinct parts (18%, 51/283), central loss
      (9%, 26/283), and peripheral loss (4%, 12/283). Two metastases from HCC and RCC
      showed diffuse heterogeneous signal loss. Lung cancer metastasis manifested as
      two distinct parts, and the metastasis in the patient with both colon cancer and 
      RCC showed peripheral signal loss. Conclusion: Heterogeneous microscopic fat in
      adrenal nodules on CS-MRI indicates a high likelihood of benignancy, particularly
      in patients without prior cancer. This finding is also commonly benign in
      patients with cancer; however, caution is warranted when primary malignancies may
      contain fat or if the morphologic pattern of signal loss may indicate a collision
      tumor. Clinical Impact: In the absence of prior cancer, adrenal nodules with
      heterogeneous microscopic fat do not require additional imaging evaluation.

TI  - Hepatic Adenoma Subtypes on Hepatobiliary Phase of Gadoxetic Acid-Enhanced MRI:
      Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
LID - 10.2214/AJR.22.27989 [doi]
AB  - Background: Accumulating evidence indicates that hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) may
      have a higher frequency of hepatobiliary phase (HBP) iso- or hyperintensity than 
      previously reported. Objective: To evaluate the proportion of HCA that
      demonstrates iso- or hyperintensity in the HBP of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI,
      stratified by HCA subtype [HNF1a inactivated (H-HCA), inflammatory (I-HCA),
      beta-catenin activated (B-HCA), and unclassified (U-HCA)], and to assess the
      diagnostic performance of HBP iso- or hyperintensity for differentiating focal
      nodular hyperplasia (FNH) from HCA. Evidence Acquisition: Pubmed, Embase, and
      Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched through February 14,
      2022 for articles reporting HBP signal intensity on gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI
      among pathologically proven HCA, stratified by subtype. The pooled proportion of 
      HBP iso- or hyperintensity was determined for each subtype and compared using
      metaregression. Diagnostic performance of HBP iso- or hyperintensity for
      differentiating FNH from all HCA subtypes combined and from B-HCA and U-HCA
      combined was assessed using bivariate modeling. Evidence Synthesis: Twenty-eight 
      studies (12 original investigations, 16 case reports or case series) were
      included, yielding 359 patients with 410 HCA (112 H-HCA, 203 I-HCA, 33 B-HCA, 62 
      U-HCA). Pooled proportion of HBP iso- or hyperintensity was 13.8% (95% CI, 4-26%)
      among all HCA, 0% (95% CI, 0-2%) among H-HCA, 11% (95% CI, 0-29%) among U-HCA,
      14% (95% CI, 2-31%) among I-HCA, and 59% (95% CI, 26-88%) among B-HCA;
      metaregression showed significant difference among subtypes (p<.001). In four
      studies reporting diagnostic performance information, HBP iso- or hyperintensity 
      had sensitivity of 99% (95% CI, 57-100%) and specificity of 89% (95% CI, 82-94%) 
      for differentiating FNH from all HCA subtypes, and sensitivity of 99% (95% CI,
      53-100%) and specificity of 65% (95% CI, 44-80%) for differentiating FNH from
      B-HCA or U-HCA. Conclusion: HCA subtypes other than H-HCA demonstrate proportions
      of HBP iso- or hyperintensity ranging from 11% (U-HCA) to 59% (B-HCA). Low
      prevalence of B-HCA has contributed to prior reports of high diagnostic
      performance of HBP iso- or hyperintensity for differentiating FNH from HCA.
      Clinical Impact: Radiologists should recognize the low specificity of HBP iso- or
      hyperintensity on gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI for differentiating FNH from
      certain HCA subtypes.

TI  - TOLLIP-mediated autophagic degradation pathway links the VCP-TMEM63A-DERL1
      signaling axis to triple-negative breast cancer progression.
PG  - 1-17
LID - 10.1080/15548627.2022.2103992 [doi]
AB  - Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most challenging breast cancer
      subtype to treat due to the lack of effective targeted therapies. Transmembrane
      (TMEM) proteins represent attractive drug targets for cancer therapy, but
      biological functions of most members of the TMEM family remain unknown. Here, we 
      report for the first time that TMEM63A (transmembrane protein 63A), a poorly
      characterized TMEM protein with unknown functions in human cancer, functions as a
      novel oncogene to promote TNBC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in
      vitro and xenograft tumor growth and lung metastasis in vivo. Mechanistic
      investigations revealed that TMEM63A localizes in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and 
      lysosome membranes, and interacts with VCP (valosin-containing protein) and its
      cofactor DERL1 (derlin 1). Furthermore, TMEM63A undergoes autophagy receptor
      TOLLIP-mediated autophagic degradation and is stabilized by VCP through blocking 
      its lysosomal degradation. Strikingly, TMEM63A in turn stabilizes oncoprotein
      DERL1 through preventing TOLLIP-mediated autophagic degradation. Notably,
      pharmacological inhibition of VCP by CB-5083 or knockdown of DERL1 partially
      abolishes the oncogenic effects of TMEM63A on TNBC progression both in vitro and 
      in vivo. Collectively, these findings uncover a previously unknown functional and
      mechanistic role for TMEM63A in TNBC progression and provide a new clue for
      targeting TMEM63A-driven TNBC tumors by using a VCP inhibitor.Abbreviations:

      by elevating B7H3 via sponging miR-15a-5p.

LID - 10.1080/15384101.2022.2105087 [doi]
AB  - Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is currently one of the malignant tumors with 
      the highest incidence and mortality rate in China. Circular RNA hsa_circ_0000896 
      (circFARSA) has been reported as being an oncogene and a potential biomarker for 
      NSCL. However, the functional role and action mechanism of circFARSA in NSCLC
      progression have not been fully elucidated. The present study demonstrated that
      circFRASA was upregulated in NSCLC tissues and cell lines, and its expression was
      positively correlated with poor prognosis of patients with NSCLC. Further
      experiments revealed that circFARSA knockdown inhibited cell proliferation,
      migration, and invasion in vitro experiments, but overexpression of circFARSA
      exhibited opposite results. Mechanistically, circFARSA facilitated the malignant 
      phenotype of NSCLC cells by enhancing B7H3 expression through sponging
      miR-15a-5p. In vivo experiments, knockdown of circFARSA restricted tumor growth
      and metastasis. In conclusion, circFARSA served as a sponge of miR-15a-5p to
      promote tumorigenesis and development of NSCLC by upregulation of B7H3
      expression, which provided evidence of circFARSA maybe act as a novel therapeutic
      target for NSCLC.

TI  - Surgical considerations in cystic fibrosis: what every general surgeon needs to
      know.
LID - 10.1111/ans.17948 [doi]
AB  - Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a complex multiorgan disease, which often affects the
      gastrointestinal tract. With improved CF specific therapies and multidisciplinary
      management, patients with CF are now living longer with a median life expectancy 
      of around 50 years. This increased life expectancy has resulted in corresponding 
      increase in presentations of the CF patient with comorbid surgical conditions
      that were never important considerations. Investigations and management of these 
      conditions, such as distal intestinal obstruction syndrome and colorectal cancer 
      warrant good clinical understanding of the unique challenges that CF patients
      present including chronic immunosuppression, impaired respiratory function and
      their multi-organ dysfunction. The purpose of this review is to provide general
      surgeons with a contemporary update on the CF related surgical issues as they are
      likely to become increasingly involved in the care of these complex patients and 
      form an integral part of the multidisciplinary team.

TI  - Estrogen Receptor Alpha Gene Amplification Is an Independent Predictor of
      Long-Term Outcome in Postmenopausal Patients with Endocrine-Responsive Early
      Breast Cancer.
PG  - OF1-OF9
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-21-4328 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Estrogen receptor (ER) expression is a prognostic parameter in breast
      cancer, and a prerequisite for the use of endocrine therapy. In ER+ early breast 
      cancer, however, no receptor-associated biomarker exists that identifies patients
      with a particularly favorable outcome. We have investigated the value of ESR1
      amplification in predicting the long-term clinical outcome in tamoxifen-treated
      postmenopausal women with endocrine-responsive breast cancer. PATIENTS AND
      METHODS: 394 patients who had been randomized into the tamoxifen-only arm of the 
      prospective randomized ABCSG-06 trial of adjuvant endocrine therapy with
      available formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue were included in this
      analysis. IHC ERalpha expression was evaluated both locally and in a central lab 
      using the Allred score, while ESR1 gene amplification was evaluated by FISH
      analysis using the ESR1/CEP6 ratio indicating focal copy number alterations.
      RESULTS: Focal ESR1 copy-number elevations (amplifications) were detected in 187 
      of 394 (47%) tumor specimens, and were associated with a favorable outcome: After
      a median follow-up of 10 years, women with intratumoral focal ESR1 amplification 
      had a significantly longer distant recurrence-free survival [adjusted HR, 0.48;
      95% confidence interval (CI), 0.26-0.91; P = 0.02] and breast cancer-specific
      survival (adjusted HR 0.47; 95% CI, 0.27-0.80; P = 0.01) as compared with women
      without ESR1 amplification. IHC ERalpha protein expression, evaluated by Allred
      score, correlated significantly with focal ESR1 amplification (P < 0.0001; chi2
      test), but was not prognostic by itself. CONCLUSIONS: Focal ESR1 amplification is
      an independent and powerful predictor for long-term distant recurrence-free and
      breast cancer-specific survival in postmenopausal women with endocrine-responsive
      early-stage breast cancer who received tamoxifen for 5 years.

TI  - Ultrasound-Activated, Tumor-Specific In Situ Synthesis of a Chemotherapeutic
      Agent Using ZIF-8 Nanoreactors for Precision Cancer Therapy.
LID - 10.1021/acsnano.2c03587 [doi]
AB  - The in situ transformation of low-toxicity precursors into a chemotherapeutic
      agent at a tumor site to enhance the efficacy of its treatment has long been an
      elusive goal. In this work, a zinc-based zeolitic imidazolate framework that
      incorporates pharmaceutically acceptable precursors is prepared as a nanoreactor 
      (NR) system for the localized synthesis of an antitumor drug. The as-prepared NRs
      are administered intratumorally in a tumor-bearing mouse model and then
      irradiated with ultrasound (US) to activate the chemical synthesis. The US
      promotes the penetration of the administered NRs into the tumor tissue to cover
      the lesion entirely, although some NRs leak into the surrounding normal tissue.
      Nevertheless, only the tumor tissue, where the H2O2 concentration is high, is
      adequately exposed to the as-synthesized antitumor drug, which markedly impedes
      development of the tumor. No significant chemical synthesis is detected in the
      surrounding normal tissue, where the local H2O2 concentration is negligible and
      the US irradiation is not directly applied. The as-proposed tumor-specific in
      situ synthesis of therapeutic molecules induces hardly any significant in vivo
      toxicity and, thus, is potentially a potent biocompatible approach to precision
      chemotherapy.

TI  - Nanocarrier Co-formulation for Delivery of a TLR7 Agonist plus an Immunogenic
      Cell Death Stimulus Triggers Effective Pancreatic Cancer Chemo-immunotherapy.
LID - 10.1021/acsnano.2c06300 [doi]
AB  - Although toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists hold great promise as immune
      modulators for reprogramming the suppressive immune landscape in pancreatic
      ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), their use is limited by poor pharmacokinetics (PK) 
      and off-target systemic inflammatory effects. To overcome these challenges as
      well as to attain drug synergy, we developed a lipid bilayer (LB)-coated
      mesoporous silica nanoparticle (silicasome) platform for co-delivery of the
      TLR7/8 agonist 3M-052 with the immunogenic chemotherapeutic agent irinotecan.
      This was accomplished by incorporating the C18 lipid tail of 3M-052 in the coated
      LB, also useful for irinotecan remote loading in the porous interior. Not only
      did the co-formulated carrier improve PK, but it strengthened the
      irinotecan-induced immunogenic cell death response by 3M-052-mediated dendritic
      cell activation at the tumor site as well as participating lymph nodes. The
      accompanying increase in CD8(+) T-cell infiltration along with a reduced number
      of regulatory T-cells was associated with tumor shrinkage and metastasis
      disappearance in subcutaneous and orthotopic KRAS-mediated pancreatic carcinoma
      tumor models. Moreover, this therapeutic outcome was accomplished without drug or
      nanocarrier toxicity. All considered, dual-delivery strategies that combine
      chemo-immunotherapy with co-formulated TLR agonists or other lipid-soluble immune
      modulators predict successful intervention in heterogeneous PDAC immune
      landscapes.

TI  - Passive Immunization with a Single Monoclonal Neutralizing Antibody Protects
      against Cutaneous and Mucosal Mouse Papillomavirus Infections.
PG  - e0070322
LID - 10.1128/jvi.00703-22 [doi]
AB  - We have established a mouse papillomavirus (MmuPV1) model that induces both
      cutaneous and mucosal infections and cancers. In the current study, we use this
      model to test our hypothesis that passive immunization using a single
      neutralizing monoclonal antibody can protect both cutaneous and mucosal sites at 
      different time points after viral inoculation. We conducted a series of
      experiments involving the administration of either a neutralizing monoclonal
      antibody, MPV.A4, or control monoclonal antibodies to both outbred and inbred
      athymic mice. Three clinically relevant mucosal sites (lower genital tract for
      females and anus and tongue for both males and females) and two cutaneous sites
      (muzzle and tail) were tested. At the termination of the experiments, all tested 
      tissues were harvested for virological analyses. Significantly lower levels of
      viral signals were detected in the MPV.A4-treated female mice up to 6 h
      post-viral inoculation compared to those in the isotype control. Interestingly,
      males displayed partial protection when they received MPV.A4 at the time of viral
      inoculation, even though they were completely protected when receiving MPV.A4 at 
      24 h before viral inoculation. We detected MPV.A4 in the blood starting at 1 h
      and up to 8 weeks postadministration in some mice. Parallel to these in vivo
      studies, we conducted in vitro neutralization using a mouse keratinocyte cell
      line and observed complete neutralization up to 8 h post-viral inoculation. Thus,
      passive immunization with a monoclonal neutralizing antibody can protect against 
      papillomavirus infection at both cutaneous and mucosal sites and is time
      dependent. IMPORTANCE This is the first study testing a single monoclonal
      neutralizing antibody (MPV.A4) by passive immunization against papillomavirus
      infections at both cutaneous and mucosal sites in the same host in the mouse
      papillomavirus model. We demonstrated that MPV.A4 administered before viral
      inoculation can protect both male and female athymic mice against MmuPV1
      infections at cutaneous and mucosal sites. MPV.A4 also offers partial protection 
      at 6 h post-viral inoculation in female mice. MPV.A4 can be detected in the blood
      from 1 h to 8 weeks after intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. Interestingly, males 
      were only partially protected when they received MPV.A4 at the time of viral
      inoculation. The failed protection in males was due to the absence of
      neutralizing MPV.A4 at the infected sites. Our findings suggest passive
      immunization with a single monoclonal neutralizing antibody can protect against
      diverse papillomavirus infections in a time-dependent manner in mice.

AB  - This study aims to conduct a meta-analysis and dose-response analysis of the
      relationship between nut intake and cancer risk and mortality. Electronic
      databases were searched. A meta-analysis was conducted to calculate the pooled
      effect sizes (ESs) with the corresponding 95% CIs, and a dose-response analysis
      was performed. A random-effects model was used in the statistical analysis. Two
      independent reviewers completed the full-text screening, data extraction, and
      quality assessment. We included 17 articles in the present meta-analysis. Total
      nuts intake was revealed to be significantly associated with reduced cancer risk 
      (ES: 0.9; 95% CI: 0.86-0.95; P < 0.001) and cancer mortality (ES: 0.88; 95% CI:
      0.85-0.92, P < 0.001), especially lung cancer risk (ES: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.81-0.91, 
      P < 0.001) and gastric cancer risk (ES: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.68-0.91, P = 0.001).
      Moreover, a 10 g/d increment of tree nuts consumption was associated with a 20%
      cancer mortality reduction (ES: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.71-0.89; P < 0.0001). Nuts intake
      is significantly associated with the reduction of cancer risk and mortality.
      Especially, nuts intake is significantly associated with reduced lung cancer risk
      and gastric cancer risk. Noticeably, a 10 g/d increase in tree nuts intake is
      related to a 20% reduction in overall cancer mortality.

TI  - Multiple UBX proteins reduce the ubiquitin threshold of the mammalian
      p97-UFD1-NPL4 unfoldase.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.76763 [doi]
LID - e76763 [pii]
AB  - The p97 / Cdc48 ATPase and its ubiquitin receptors Ufd1-Npl4 are essential to
      unfold ubiquitylated proteins in many areas of eukaryotic cell biology. In yeast,
      Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4 is controlled by a quality control mechanism, whereby substrates 
      must be conjugated to at least five ubiquitins. Here we show that mammalian
      p97-UFD1-NPL4 is governed by a complex interplay between additional p97 cofactors
      and the number of conjugated ubiquitins. Using reconstituted assays for the
      disassembly of ubiquitylated CMG (Cdc45-MCM-GINS) helicase by human
      p97-UFD1-NPL4, we show that the unfoldase has a high ubiquitin threshold for
      substrate unfolding, which can be reduced by the UBX proteins UBXN7, FAF1 or
      FAF2. Our data indicate that the UBX proteins function by binding to
      p97-UFD1-NPL4 and stabilising productive interactions between UFD1-NPL4 and
      K48-linked chains of at least five ubiquitins. Stimulation by UBXN7 is dependent 
      upon known ubiquitin binding motifs, whereas FAF1 and FAF2 use a previously
      uncharacterised coiled-coil domain to reduce the ubiquitin threshold of
      p97-UFD1-NPL4. We show that deleting the Ubnx7 and Faf1 genes impairs CMG
      disassembly during S-phase and mitosis and sensitises cells to reduced ubiquitin 
      ligase activity. These findings indicate that multiple UBX proteins are important
      for the efficient unfolding of ubiquitylated proteins by p97-UFD1-NPL4 in
      mammalian cells.

TI  - Flow lithography for structured microparticles: fundamentals, methods and
      applications.
LID - 10.1039/d2lc00421f [doi]
AB  - Structured microparticles, with unique shapes, customizable sizes, multiple
      materials, and spatially-defined chemistries, are leading the way for emerging
      'lab on a particle' technologies. These microparticles with engineered designs
      find applications in multiplexed diagnostics, drug delivery, single-cell
      secretion assays, single-molecule detection assays, high throughput cytometry,
      micro-robotics, self-assembly, and tissue engineering. In this article we review 
      state-of-the-art particle manufacturing technologies based on flow-assisted
      photolithography performed inside microfluidic channels. Important
      physicochemical concepts are discussed to provide a basis for understanding the
      fabrication technologies. These photolithography technologies are compared based 
      on the structural as well as compositional complexity of the fabricated
      particles. Particles are categorized, from 1D to 3D particles, based on the
      number of dimensions that can be independently controlled during the fabrication 
      process. After discussing the advantages of the individual techniques, important 
      applications of the fabricated particles are reviewed. Lastly, a future
      perspective is provided with potential directions to improve the throughput of
      particle fabrication, realize new particle shapes, measure particles in an
      automated manner, and adopt the 'lab on a particle' technologies to other areas
      of research.

AB  - To elaborate on the role of circular RNA 0001955 (circ_0001955) on the
      proliferation and apoptosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells and its
      underlying mechanism. Circ_0001955 expression in NSCLC was screened out through
      bioinformatics analysis based on GEO database. Circ_0001955, microRNA-769-5p
      (miR-769-5p), and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression in NSCLC
      tissues and cell lines was examined using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)
      and Western blot. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were examined using the CCK-8 
      method, BrdU experiment and flow cytometry analysis, respectively. Bioinformatics
      prediction, dual-luciferase reporter gene experiment and RNA immunoprecipitation 
      (RIP) experiments were applied to validate the targeting relationship between
      miR-769-5p and circ_0001955 and the 3' UTR of EGFR. Pearson's correlation
      analysis was employed to validate the correlations among them. Circ_0001955
      expression was up-regulated in NSCLC tissues and cell lines, and its
      overexpression was strongly associated with increased tumor TNM stage and lymph
      node metastasis. Circ_0001955 overexpression enhanced the proliferation and
      restrained the apoptosis in NSCLC cells, whereas knocking down circ_0001955
      exerted the opposite effects. Circ_0001955 directly targeted miR-769-5p and
      negatively regulated its expression. EGFR, a target gene of miR-769-5p, could be 
      indirectly and positively regulated by circ_0001955. Correlation analysis
      indicated that circ_0001955 was negatively correlated with miR-769-5p expression,
      while circ_0001955 was positively correlated with EGFR expression. Circ_0001955
      facilitates the proliferation and represses the apoptosis of NSCLC cells by
      modulating miR-769-5p/EGFR axis.

LID - ERC-22-0102 [pii]
AB  - Neuroendocrine carcinomas (NEC) are aggressive malignant diseases.
      Etoposide-based rechallenge (EBR) and the prognostic role of Rb status in
      second-line chemotherapy (2L) have not been studied. The objectives of this study
      were to report the results of 2L including EBR as well as prognostic factors in a
      national retrospective multicenter study. NEC patients treated in 2L and further,
      with tissue samples available were included. Rb status and morphological
      classification were reviewed centrally. Among the 121 NEC patients (40% female,
      median age 61) included, there were 73 small cell NEC (60%), 34 large cell NEC
      (28%) and 14 NEC (not otherwise specified, 12%). Primary sites were lung (39%),
      gastro-enteropancreatic (36%), other (13%) and unknown (12%). Median Ki-67 index 
      was 80%. Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) under
      2L were 2.1 and 6.2 months, respectively. No difference was observed between
      patients who received an "Adenocarcinoma-like" or a "Neuroendocrine-like" 2L or
      according to the Rb status. Thoracic primary was the only adverse prognostic
      factor for OS. EBR, administered to 31 patients, resulted in a 62% disease
      control rate with a median PFS and OS of 3.2 and 11.7 months respectively. In the
      94 patients with a relapse-free interval >/= 3 months after first-line
      platinum-etoposide, median OS was 12 months in patients who received EBR as
      compared to 5.9 months in patients who did not (p=0.043). EBR could be the best
      2L option for patient with initial response to first line platinum-etoposide
      lasting at least 3 months. Rb status does not provide prognostic information in
      this setting.

TI  - Prognostic value of texture analysis of the primary tumour in high-risk
      neuroblastoma: An (18) F-DOPA PET study.
PG  - e29910
LID - 10.1002/pbc.29910 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the prognostic value of texture analysis of the primary
      tumour with (18) fluorine-dihydroxyphenylalanine positron emission
      tomography/X-ray computed tomography ((18) F-DOPA PET/CT) in patients affected by
      high-risk neuroblastoma (HR-NBL). METHODS: We retrospectively analysed 18
      patients with HR-NBL, which had been prospectively enrolled in the course of a
      previous trial investigating the diagnostic role of (18) F-DOPA PET/CT at the
      time of the first onset. Texture analysis of the primary tumour was carried out
      on the PET images using LifeX. Conventional indices, histogram parameters, grey
      level co-occurrence (GLCM), run-length (GLRLM), neighbouring difference (NGLDM)
      and zone-length (GLZLM) matrices parameter were extracted; their values were
      compared with the overall metastatic load, expressed by means of whole-body
      metabolic burden (WBMB) score and the progression-free/overall survival (PFS and 
      OS). RESULTS: There was a direct correlation between WBMB and radiomics parameter
      describing uptake intensity (SUVmean : p = .004) and voxel heterogeneity
      (entropy: p = .026; GLCM_Contrast: p = .001). Conversely, texture indices of
      homogeneity showed an inverse correlation with WBMB (energy: p = .026;
      GLCM_Homogeneity: p = .006). On the multivariate model, WBMB (p < .01) and the
      first standardised uptake value (SUV) quartile (p < .001) predicted PFS; OS was
      predicted by WBMB and the N-myc proto-oncogene protein (MYCN) amplification (p < 
      .05) for both. CONCLUSIONS: Textural parameters describing heterogeneity and
      metabolic intensity of the primary HR-NBL are closely associated with its overall
      metastatic burden. In turn, the whole-body tumour load appears to be one of the
      most relevant predictors of progression-free and overall survival.

LID - 10.1002/pbc.29900 [doi]
AB  - While Wilms tumors are the most frequently detected kidney cancer type in
      children, extrarenal Wilms tumors (ERWTs) remain rare. This report is the first
      to describe hypertension and dilated cardiomyopathy in a patient with an ERWT. A 
      6-month-old male infant presented with an abdominal mass and paroxysmal
      hypertension; echocardiography revealed dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection
      fraction of 34%, as well as substantially increased plasma renin activity.
      Pathology yielded a definitive diagnosis of ERWT. Cardiac function and blood
      pressure gradually returned to normal after tumorectomy. The early diagnosis of
      such a tumor together with efficient oncologic treatment are vital to optimal
      patient outcomes.

TI  - THE ROLE OF ONCOLOGICAL PROCESS IN OCCURRENCE OF POSTOPERATIVE EVENTRATION.
PG  - 13-16
AB  - Eventration is one of the rare but the most dangerous postoperative complications
      in the abdominal surgery registered in 0.5-2.35% of patients. Eventration occurs 
      most frequently after urgent surgery on the abdominal organs of weakened patients
      of the old and elderly ages with a low immune-biological condition of the body.
      Examination of certain specific features of eventration occurrence with
      underlying oncological process will allow better understanding the latter in the 
      development of the postoperative complication. Therefore, the objective of the
      research was to examine experimentally the effect of malignant neoplasm on the
      mechanical strength of the laparotomy wound postoperative scar on small
      laboratory animals, and to study clinically occurrence of postoperative
      eventration development in patients with malignant neoplasms of the abdominal
      organs. The experimental studies were carried out on 78 laboratory rats operated 
      on by means of laparotomy 3,0 cm in length. Heren's carcinoma was preliminary
      grafted under the skin of the external femoral surface in the main group of
      animals. The mechanical strength of the laparotomy wound scar was determined on
      the 1st, 3rd and 5th days after surgery by means of measuring abdominal pressure 
      at the moment of scar rupture. 140 were examined who underwent midline laparotomy
      for surgical treatment of abdominal diseases. The main group included 98 patients
      with malignant neoplasms of the abdominal organs who were divided into two groups
      depending on the stages of oncological process. The first subgroup included 46
      individuals at the I-II stages of the disease, and the second subgroup of the
      main group included 52 patients at the II-IV stages of the disease. The group of 
      comparison involved 42 patients with acute surgical non-oncological pathology of 
      the abdominal organs. Both groups of patients were comparable by the age and
      gender. An average age of patients in both groups of the study was 60.1+/-0.95
      years. An average length of the laparotomy wound was 27.1+/-0.25 cm. The obtained
      results were statistically processed on the personal computer by means of
      electronic tables Microsoft Excel and the package of statistical processing
      program IBM SPSS Statistics. The results of the experimental studies are
      indicative of the fact that malignant process in the body results not only in
      inhibited maturation of the granulation tissue in the laparotomy wound, but in
      reduced strength of the postoperative scar beginning with the 3rd day after
      surgery performed. Analysis of the results of our clinical study enables to admit
      reliable increase of occurrence of "local" postoperative complications including 
      suppuration of the postoperative wound and eventration, especially when
      oncological process is at the late stages of the disease. This specific feature
      should be considered when sutures and drainage are applied on the laparotomy
      wound in this group of patients. Thus, oncological process at the late stages of 
      the disease promotes reduced strength of the laparotomy wound postoperative scar 
      and results in an increased occurrence of eventration and suppuration of the
      postoperative wound.

TI  - "Failure to Rescue" following Colorectal Cancer Resection: Variation and
      Improvements in a National Study of Postoperative Mortality: Reducing Mortality
      after Colorectal Surgery.
LID - 10.1097/SLA.0000000000005650 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine variation in "failure to rescue" (FTR) as a driver of
      differences in mortality between centres and over time for patients undergoing
      colorectal cancer surgery. BACKGROUND: Wide variation exists in postoperative
      mortality following colorectal cancer surgery. FTR has been identified as an
      important determinant of variation in postoperative outcomes. We hypothesized
      that differences in mortality both between hospitals and over time are driven by 
      variation in FTR. METHODS: A national population-based study of patients
      undergoing colorectal cancer resection from 2010-2019 in Aotearoa New Zealand was
      conducted. Rates of 90-day FTR, mortality, and complications were calculated
      overall, and for surgical and nonoperative complications. Twenty District Health 
      Boards (DHBs) were ranked into quartiles using risk- and reliability-adjusted
      90-day mortality rates. Variation between DHBs and trends over the 10-year period
      were examined. RESULTS: Overall, 15,686 patients undergoing resection for
      colorectal adenocarcinoma were included. Increased postoperative mortality at
      high-mortality centers (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.8-3.3) was driven by higher rates of FTR
      (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.5-2.8), and postoperative complications (OR 1.4, 95% CI
      1.3-1.6). These trends were consistent across operative and nonoperative
      complications. Over the 2010-2019 period, postoperative mortality halved (OR 0.5,
      95% CI 0.4-0.6), associated with a greater improvement in FTR (OR 0.5, 95% CI
      0.4-0.7) than complications (OR 0.8, 95% CI 0.8-0.9). Differences between centers
      and over time remained when only analyzing patients undergoing elective surgery. 
      CONCLUSION: Mortality following colorectal cancer resection has halved over the
      past decade, predominantly driven by improvements in "rescue" from complications.
      Differences in FTR also drive hospital-level variation in mortality, highlighting
      the central importance of "rescue" as a target for surgical quality improvement.

TI  - Adherence to Oral Treatments in Older Patients with Advanced Prostate Cancer, the
      ADHERE Study: A Prospective Trial of the Meet-URO Network.
LID - oyac147 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/oncolo/oyac147 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Novel androgen receptor signaling inhibitors for prostate cancer (PC)
      impose the burden of self-administration on older patients overwhelmed by the
      requirement of many other concomitant medications. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This
      study evaluated the proportion of non-adherence in a 12-month follow-up period
      and the first 3 months to abiraterone (ABI) or enzalutamide (ENZ). In a
      prospective multicenter observational cohort study, patients with metastatic
      castration-resistant PC (mCRPC) aged >/=70 years receiving ABI or ENZ pre- or
      post-docetaxel were enrolled. Treatment monitoring included pill counting, a
      self-assessment questionnaire, and clinical diaries at each clinical visit.
      Non-adherence rates were based on proportions of missed/prescribed pills ratios
      by pill counting. RESULTS: Overall, 234 patients were recruited with median age
      of 78 years (range, 73-82); 86 (37%) were treated with ABI, and 148 (63%) with
      ENZ. The median follow-up for adherence was seven monthly cycles (IQR: 4-12). The
      two cohorts were well balanced for baseline characteristics. The percentage of
      non-adherence by pill counting was slightly higher for ABI than ENZ (5.2% vs.
      4.2%, P < .001). By self-reporting, patients on ENZ tended to report more
      frequently than those with ABI forgetfulness as the reason for missing events
      (42% vs. 17%, P < .001). A lower Geriatric G8 score correlated with non-adherence
      (P = .004). Overall survival (OS) was 48.8 months. Patients on ABI had
      radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) of 28.4 [24.2-32.5], while for ENZ 
      patients, we reported a median rPFS of 23.1 [18.2-28.1] months. CONCLUSION:
      Physicians tend to treat older mCRPC patients with ENZ. Non-adherence rate is
      relatively low overall but can be higher with ABI than with ENZ and correlates
      with the Geriatric G8 score. Forgetfulness is a potential barrier for ENZ.

TI  - Five-Year Prospective Observational Study of African-American Men on Active
      Surveillance for Prostate Cancer Demonstrates Race Is Not Predictive of Oncologic
      Outcomes.
LID - oyac154 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/oncolo/oyac154 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to evaluate if race impacted outcomes or risk of
      disease progression in men on active surveillance (AS) for prostate cancer. We
      present the results from our majority African-American cohort of men in an equal 
      access setting over a 5-year follow-up period. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients
      who elected AS for prostate cancer at the Southeast Louisiana Veterans Health
      Care System are entered into a prospectively managed observational database.
      Patients were divided into groups based on self-reported race. Grade group
      progression was defined as pathologic upgrading above International Society of
      Urological Pathology Grade Group 1 disease on subsequent biopsies following
      diagnostic biopsy. All tests were 2 sided using a significance of .05. RESULTS: A
      total of 228 men met inclusion criteria in the study, including 154 non-Hispanic 
      African American and 74 non-Hispanic Caucasian American men, with a median
      follow-up of 5 years from the initiation of AS. Race was not predictive of
      Gleason grade progression, AS discontinuation, or biochemical recurrence on Cox
      multivariate analysis (HR = 1.01, 0.94, 0.85, P = .96, .79, .81, respectively).
      On Kaplan-Meier analysis at 5 years, African-American progression-free, AS
      discontinuation free, and overall survival probability was comparable to their
      Caucasian American counterparts (P > .05 for all). CONCLUSIONS: Active
      surveillance is a safe treatment option for low and very low risk prostate
      cancer, regardless of race. African-American and Caucasian-American men did not
      have any significant difference in Gleason grade group progression in our cohort 
      with 5-year follow-up.

TI  - Using Cg05575921 methylation to predict lung cancer risk: a potentially bias-free
      precision epigenetics approach.
PG  - 1-13
LID - 10.1080/15592294.2022.2108082 [doi]
AB  - The decision to engage in lung cancer screening (LCS) necessitates weighing
      benefits versus harms. Previously, clinicians in the United States have used the 
      PLCOM2012 algorithm to guide LCS decision-making. However, that formula contains 
      race and gender-based variables. Previously, using data from a European study,
      Bojesen and colleagues have suggested that cg05575921 methylation could guide
      decision-making. To test this hypothesis in a more diverse American population,
      we examined DNA and clinical data from 3081 subjects from the National Lung
      Screening Trial (NLST) study. Using survival analysis, we found a simple linear
      predictor consisting of age, pack-year consumption and cg05575921, to have the
      best predictive power among several alternatives (AUC = 0.66). Results showed
      that the highest quartile of risk was more than 2-fold more likely to develop
      lung cancer than those in the lowest quartile. Race, ethnicity, and gender had no
      effect on prediction with both cg05575921 and pack years contributing equally
      (both p < 0.003) to risk prediction. Current smokers had considerably lower
      methylation than former smokers (46% vs 67%; p < 0.001) with the average
      methylation of those who quit approaching 80% after 25 years of cessation.
      Finally, current male smokers had lower mean cg05575921 percentage than female
      smokers (46% vs 49%; p < 0.001). We conclude that cg05575921 (along with age and 
      pack years) can be used to guide LCS decision-making, and additional studies
      might focus on how best to use methylation to inform decision-making.

      carcinogenesis in Swiss Albino mice.
PG  - e23187
LID - 10.1002/jbt.23187 [doi]
AB  - Lung cancer, one of the most common cancer is a cause of concern associated with 
      cancer-related mortality. Benzo[a]pyrene [B(a)P], a potent carcinogen as well as 
      an environmental contaminant is reported to be found in cigarette smoke among
      various sources. The present study focuses on the chemopreventive potential of
      Diosmin against B[a]P-induced lung carcinogenesis and its possible mechanism in
      male Swiss Albino mice (SAM). SAM were treated orally with Diosmin (200 mg/kg
      b.w.) for 16 weeks and/or B[a]P (50 mg/kg b.w) for a period of 4 weeks. B[a]P
      treated cancerous mice showed increased peroxidation of membrane lipid as well as
      a decrease in the level/activity of antioxidant proteins. Cancerous mice also
      showed an increased level of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and neuron-specific
      enolase (NSE). Diosmin treatment, however, leads to decreased peroxidation of
      lipids, increased antioxidant proteins as well decrease in the level of CEA and
      NSE. B[a]P-induced cancerous animals also exhibited increased expression of
      cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB), COX2 as well as
      prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2) while Diosmin-treated mice were found to have an
      ameliorative effect. Histopathological results further confirm the protective
      effect of Diosmin in averting B[a]P-induced pathological alterations of lung
      tissue. Overall, our results suggest Diosmin exerts its chemopreventive potential
      possibly via targeting the CREB/cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)/PGE2 pathway thereby
      repressing inflammation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients requiring
      intensive care unit (ICU) admission early after transplantation have a poor
      prognosis. However, many studies have only focused on allogeneic HSCT recipients.
      OBJECTIVES: To describe the characteristics of HSCT recipients admitted to the
      ICU shortly after transplantation and assess differences in 1-year mortality
      between autologous and allogeneic HSCT recipients. DESIGN AND SETTING: A
      single-center retrospective cohort study in a cancer center in Brazil. METHODS:
      We included all consecutive patients who underwent HSCT less than a year before
      ICU admission between 2009 and 2018. We collected clinical and demographic data
      and assessed the 1-year mortality of all patients. The effect of allogeneic HSCT 
      compared with autologous HSCT on 1-year mortality risk was evaluated in an
      unadjusted model and an adjusted Cox proportional hazard model for age and
      Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) at admission. RESULTS: Of the 942
      patients who underwent HSCT during the study period, 83 (8.8%) were included in
      the study (autologous HSCT = 57 [68.7%], allogeneic HSCT = 26 [31.3%]). At 1 year
      after ICU admission, 21 (36.8%) and 18 (69.2%) patients who underwent autologous 
      and allogeneic HSCT, respectively, had died. Allogeneic HSCT was associated with 
      increased 1-year mortality (unadjusted hazard ratio, HR = 2.79 [confidence
      interval, CI, 95%, 1.48-5.26]; adjusted HR = 2.62 [CI 95%, 1.29-5.31]).
      CONCLUSION: Allogeneic HSCT recipients admitted to the ICU had higher short- and 
      long-term mortality rates than autologous HSCT recipients, even after adjusting
      for age and severity at ICU admission.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The frequency of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases among
      asthmatics has been reported to be reduced. However, the findings regarding the
      association between asthma and the risk of severe COVID-19 have been divergent.
      OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether asthma is associated with a reduced risk of
      development of severe COVID-19. DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective analysis on
      COVID-19 surveillance databases at two tertiary-level hospitals in Sao Paulo,
      Brazil. METHODS: The medical records of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19
      between March and August 2020 were reviewed in accordance with the clinical,
      laboratorial, radiological and epidemiological criteria for COVID-19, and for
      comorbidities. RESULTS: Among the adult patients included (> 18 years of age)
      there were 52 asthmatics and 1,318 non-asthmatics. Their median ages and
      interquartile ranges (IQR) were, respectively, 54 (41-69) and 60 (44-72) years.
      At least one comorbidity was seen in 73% of asthmatics and 56% of the
      non-asthmatics. Among the asthmatics, most presented mild asthma (92%) and the
      prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was high (27%). The
      asthmatics presented an unadjusted odds ratio (OR) for severe COVID-19 of 0.89
      (95% confidence interval, CI 0.5-1.56); and OR 0.88 (95% CI 0.5 -1.68) after
      multivariable adjustment. Age > 60 years, male sex, hypertension, diabetes,
      cancer and homelessness were covariates associated with increased odds for severe
      COVID-19. Kaplan-Meier estimated survival over hospitalization of up to 30 days
      did not differ between the groups (log-rank P = 0.09). CONCLUSIONS: The
      association between asthma and decreased risk of severe COVID-19 or increased
      survival was statistically non-significant.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the relationship between occupation and lung cancer in
      patients at a national referral hospital for cancer care in southern Brazil.
      METHOD: Hospital-based case-control study conducted between February and October 
      2019. Occupational histories were coded according to international
      classifications and translated into occupations associated with lung cancer (List
      A and B). The odds ratios were adjusted for smoking, with a 95% confidence
      interval, calculated by conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: 99 cases and
      227 controls were included. Among men, the occupation of painters (list A) was
      associated with lung cancer (OR = 14.3; 95% CI: 1.8-116.5), there were no
      occupations in list B associated with lung cancer. In women, no increased risks
      were found. CONCLUSIONS: It has been shown that exposure to occupational
      carcinogens among repair and construction painters increases the risk of lung
      cancer.

AB  - Recent studies have explored the prognostic role of the C-reactive protein to
      albumin ratio (CAR) in patients with bile duct cancer (BTC), but the results have
      been inconsistent. This study aimed to provide insight into the prognostic
      significance of the CAR in BTC prior to treatment using a meta-analysis.
      Summarized hazard ratios (HRs) or odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals 
      (CIs) were calculated for prognosis and clinicopathological features using fixed 
      or random effects models. Fourteen studies with a total of 1,543 subjects were
      included in this meta-analysis. Elevated CAR was significantly associated with
      poor overall survival (HR = 2.17, 95% CI = 1.81-2.60, P < 0.001) and decreased
      disease-free survival or recurrence-free survival (HR = 2.53, 95% CI = 1.98-3.25,
      P < 0.001) in BTC. In addition, high CAR was significantly associated with the
      presence of lymph node metastasis (OR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.12- 2.13, P = 0.008),
      bile duct invasion (OR = 2.64, 95% CI = 1.54-4.54, P < 0.001), and tumor stages
      III-IV (OR = 3.11, 95% CI = 1.05-9.20, P = 0.040). However, there was no
      significant association between CAR and sex, microvascular invasion, or
      resection. An elevated CAR was significantly related to worse long-term and
      short-term survival and advanced clinicopathological features of BTC. CAR could
      serve as a valuable, noninvasive prognostic marker in patients with BTC.

TI  - Inhibition of APLN suppresses cell proliferation and migration and promotes cell 
      apoptosis in esophageal cancer cells <em>in vitro</em>, through activating
      PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway.
LID - 10.4081/ejh.2022.3336 [doi]
AB  - Esophageal cancer is the sixth leading cause of cancer mortalities globally with 
      a high incidence rate. Apelin (APLN) plays regulatory roles in different organs. 
      However, its role in esophageal cancer remains unknown. Therefore, our study aims
      to explore the effect of APLN on esophageal cancer. One hundred and eighty-four
      (184) esophageal tumor tissues samples from patients with esophageal cancer, and 
      11 esophageal tissues samples from healthy volunteers were analyzed for the
      expression of APLN. APLN was highly expressed in the tumor of patients with
      esophageal cancer and esophageal cancer cells. Patients with high expressions of 
      APLN had a lower survival rate than the ones with low to medium expressions of
      APLN. Human esophageal carcinoma cell lines, TE-1 and ECA-109 cells were
      transfected with APLN siRNA to knockdown APLN, or transfected with pcDNA-APLN to 
      overexpress APLN. Inhibition of APLN by siRNA-APLN reduced proliferative,
      migrative, and invasive abilities of esophageal cancer cells and promoted cell
      apoptosis, which could be all restored by pcDNA-APLN. Moreover, knocking down
      APLN by siRNA-APLN suppressed the PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway. These findings
      identify that APLN inhibition might ameliorate esophageal cancer through
      activating the PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway, thus APLN could be a potential target
      for esophageal cancer.

AB  - Benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC), derived from cruciferous vegetables, is an
      organosulfur compound exerting antiproliferative effects in several human cancer 
      cells. In this study, we assessed BITC as a potential osteoclastogenesis
      inhibitor and investigated its underlying mechanism. BITC at 5 muM significantly 
      decreased the viability of the osteoclast-like differentiating RAW264.7 cells,
      coinciding with the downregulation of the primary biomarkers for osteoclast
      differentiation, such as the tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity and
      nuclear factor of activated T-cells gene expression. Not only BITC but also its
      metabolites, inhibited cell proliferation in the normal RAW264.7 cells,
      suggesting that BITC shows an anti-osteoclastogenesis effect in vivo after its
      ingestion and metabolism, possibly through an antiproliferative action. Both BITC
      and its metabolites also enhanced the DNA fragmentation and the caspase-3
      activity, whereas their higher concentrations tended to suppress these effects.
      BITC was intracellularly accumulated when the cells were treated with its
      metabolites via their degradation into the free form. A quantitative experiment
      using the proteolysis/high performance liquid chromatography technique showed
      that the amount of BITC-lysine thiourea in the cells was also increased in a
      time-dependent manner, suggesting that lysine modification of the cellular
      proteins actually took place in the cells treated by BITC. Among the cellular
      proteins, the cleaved caspase-3 was identified as a potential target for lysine
      modification by BITC. Taken together, BITC dissociated from its metabolites as
      well as its free form might modulate osteoclastogenesis, possibly through
      inhibition of cell proliferation by protein modification.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Medical malpractice occurs in cases, where a patient experiences
      damage as a result of the doctor's deviation from the standard practice or care. 
      As in all medical specialties, thoracic surgeons may face medical malpractice
      claims. METHODS: Among the files reviewed by the First Board of Specialization of
      the Council of Forensic Medicine between January 01, 2010, and December 21, 2015,
      cases with malpractice allegations against thoracic surgeons were analyzed
      retrospectively. RESULTS: Fifty-nine of the cases were male (72.8%), and 22 were 
      female (27.2%). The mean age was 51.13+/-18.97 years, and the most common age
      range was >60 years (n=35, 43.2%). Medical malpractice was confirmed in 11
      (13.6%) of the cases. A diagnostic error was the most common cause of error (n=7,
      63.6%), and the most common cause of a diagnostic error was failure to diagnose a
      condition on time (n=4, 36.4%). The most frequent diagnosis was 'injuries due to 
      trauma' (n=54, 66.7%), followed by lung cancer (n=9, 11.1%). It was found that
      80.2% (n=65) of the doctors intervened with the patient as a consultant.
      Complications developed in 48 (59.3%) of the cases. The most common complication 
      was pneumonia (n=7, 14.6%). CONCLUSION: This was the first study in Turkey that
      included cases of medical malpractice claims that involved thoracic surgeons. We 
      think that examining cases with medical malpractice claims will help physicians
      not only better understand the characteristics of malpractice claims but also
      develop strategies to prevent malpractice claims.

      suppressing K562 cells in vitro.
PG  - e23185
LID - 10.1002/jbt.23185 [doi]
AB  - Despite advances in cancer treatment, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is still one
      of the leading causes of death in the world. Due to the role of inflammation in
      cancer promotion and progression, thus use of anti-inflammatory agents may
      suppress cancer cell growth. In this study, we used two anti-inflammatory drugs, 
      cilostazol and meloxicam, for the treatment of CML. Cell viability was measured
      using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay
      and the synergism occurrence was calculated by compusyn software. Annexin V/PI
      test and Hoechst staining were used to determine the apoptosis rate. To determine
      the pathway of apoptosis induction, the expression of BCL2 Associated X (Bax) and
      B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) apoptotic genes and caspases activity were evaluated.
      The cell cycle was analyzed by propidium iodide (PI) staining and flow cytometry.
      Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence were performed to estimate
      alterations in Ak strain transforming-1 (AKT-1), phosphprylated AKT-1 (p-AKT-1), 
      adenosine mono-phosphate-kinase (AMPK), and phosphorylated AMPK (p-AMPK) proteins
      and BCR/ABL and c-Myc distribution, respectively. Results showed that cilostazol,
      meloxicam, and their combination drug reduced cell viability (p < 0.05). Compared
      with control, expression of Bax and Bcl-2 decreased in treated cells,
      respectively (p < 0.05). The caspase-9 activity increased in treated cells
      compared to control cells (p < 0.001). The applied drugs decreased the protein
      level of p-AKT-1 while increasing the p-AMPK protein level (p < 0.05). BCR/ABL
      and c-Myc Protein distribution significantly decreased in treated cells. In
      conclusion, the combination drug had more cytotoxic effects than cilostazol and
      meloxicam alone and induced apoptosis by inhibiting AKT-1 activation and c-Myc
      reduction. Therefore using combination drugs effectively can treat cancers of CML
      origin.

      arthritis: A retrospective registry-based study in Iran.
LID - 10.1111/1756-185X.14405 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to study the outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
      in patients with a history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in Iran, where most
      patients receive corticosteroids and are at high risk for COVID-19 infection.
      METHOD: We collected the demographic, diagnostic, and treatment data of all
      COVID-19 patients by the clinical COVID-19 registry system. We recruited 38 RA
      patients and 2216 non-RA patients from the COVID-19 registry. The primary outcome
      was mortality due to COVID-19. We also studied the risk of intensive care unit
      admission and intubation in RA patients compared to non-RA patients. We used
      multiple logistic regression analysis to study the association between RA and the
      risk of COVID-19 outcomes. RESULT: We recruited 38 RA patients and 2216 non-RA
      patients from the COVID-19 registry. The RA patients had a higher mean age (59.9 
      years) than the non-RA patients (57.7 years). The group of RA patients had a
      larger proportion of women (76.3%) than the non-RA patients (40.8%). The death
      rate due to COVID-19 was significantly higher in RA patients than non-RA patients
      (odds ratio [OR] = 2.69, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.24-5.81). The OR was
      higher among those who received prednisolone than among those who did not (OR =
      3.59, 95% CI = 1.54-7.81). The odds of intubation were statistically significant 
      among patients who received corticosteroid therapy (OR = 2.58, 95% CI =
      1.07-6.18). CONCLUSION: The risk of COVID-19 outcomes was higher in RA patients
      than non-RA patients, especially for RA patients who received a low dose of
      prednisolone. The results of this study can be used to triage RA patients who get
      infected by COVID-19. Further studies with larger sample sizes are required to
      more precisely define the high-risk groups.

AB  - The aim of this study is to determine whether the preventive positioning of a
      salivary bypass tube (SBT) after total laryngectomy (TL) reduces the incidence of
      postoperative pharyngocutaneous fistula (PCF) and pharyngeal stenosis (PS). This 
      study was conducted in conformity with the PRISMA statement. 1960 patients with a
      median age of 62.0 years were included. A SBT was placed in 980 (50%) patients
      (SBT group). The cumulative PCF incidence in the SBT group was 15.8% (95% CI:
      9.3-23.6). The measured pooled OR comparing PCF incidence in patients with SBT
      compared to those without was 0.40 (95% CI: 0.24-0.65). The pooled PS incidence
      in the SBT group was 12.3% (95% CI: 5.4-21.6). The measured pooled OR comparing
      PS incidence in patients with SBT compared to those without was 0.43 (95% CI:
      0.24-0.65). PCF and PS could be prevented by the intra-operative placement of a
      SBT.

TI  - Breaking the Iron Homeostasis: A "Trojan Horse" Self-Assembled Nanodrug
      Sensitizes Homologous Recombination Proficient Ovarian Cancer Cells to PARP
      Inhibition.
LID - 10.1021/acsnano.2c04956 [doi]
AB  - Poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors are used in
      ovarian cancer treatment and have greatly improved the survival rates for
      homologous recombination repair (HRR)-deficient patients. However, their
      therapeutic efficacy is limited in HRR-proficient ovarian cancer. Thus,
      sensitizing HRR-proficient ovarian cancer cells to PARP inhibitors is important
      in clinical practice. Here, a nanodrug, olaparib-Ga, was designed using
      self-assembly of the PARP inhibitor olaparib into bovine serum albumin through
      gallic acid gallium(III) coordination via a convenient and green synthetic
      method. Compared with olaparib, olaparib-Ga featured an ultrasmall size of 7 nm
      and led to increased suppression of cell viability, induction of DNA damage, and 
      enhanced cell apoptosis in the SKOV3 and OVCAR3 HRR-proficient ovarian cancer
      cells in vitro. Further experiments indicated that the olaparib-Ga nanodrug could
      suppress RRM2 expression, activate the Fe(2+)/ROS/MAPK pathway and HMOX1
      signaling, inhibit the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, and enhance the expression of 
      cleaved-caspase 3 and BAX protein. This, in turn, led to increased cell apoptosis
      in HRR-proficient ovarian cancer cells. Moreover, olaparib-Ga effectively
      restrained SKOV3 and OVCAR3 tumor growth and exhibited negligible toxicity in
      vivo. In conclusion, we propose that olaparib-Ga can act as a promising nanodrug 
      for the treatment of HRR-proficient ovarian cancer.

TI  - A Combination of Preoperative Computed Tomography-Defined Sarcopenia and Systemic
      Inflammation on Survival in Patients with Poorly Differentiated Neuroendocrine
      Neoplasms Following Radical Resection.
PG  - 1-11
LID - 10.1080/01635581.2022.2102660 [doi]
AB  - This retrospective study of 122 patients with gastrointestinal poorly
      differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms (GI-PDNEN) who underwent radical
      resection between January 2010 and December 2020 aimed to investigate the
      usefulness of combined computed tomography (CT)-defined sarcopenia and systemic
      inflammation to evaluate long-term prognoses for patients who underwent radical
      surgical resection. Sarcopenia, based on a pre-defined L3 skeletal muscle index
      cutoff value, was assessed using preoperative abdominal CT images. Patients
      (neuroendocrine carcinoma, 86 patients; mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma, 36
      patients) were divided into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups using
      sarcopenia scores and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios (SNLRs). Higher SNLRs were 
      significantly associated with higher age (P = 0.004), larger tumor size (P =
      0.042), lower body mass index (P = 0.042), and lower hemoglobin (P = 0.001) and
      albumin (P = 0.031) levels. Multivariate analysis indicated that a higher SNLR
      was an independent risk factor for poor overall survival (OS, P = 0.01) and
      relapse-free survival (RFS, P = 0.001) in patients with GI-PDNEN postoperatively.
      Sarcopenia and a higher NLR were significantly associated with poor RFS and OS
      following radical resection. The SNLR had a definite predictive prognostic value 
      in preoperatively identifying patients with GI-PDNEN and a probable poor
      long-term prognosis, especially those with neuroendocrine carcinoma.

TI  - Transposition nasolabial flap: A versatile flap for sensate reconstruction of lip
      defects.
LID - 10.1002/hed.27164 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Lip reconstruction aims at maintaining the function and aesthetics 
      of the facial subunits. Sensation in the reconstructed lip helps in bolus
      formation, tactile discrimination, and thermal sensation. In this study, we aim
      to describe random pattern nasolabial flap for lip reconstruction using various
      functional parameters. METHODOLOGY: This is a retrospective study of 22 patients 
      with carcinoma lip who underwent surgical resection and reconstruction with
      sensate nasolabial flap. Several clinicopathological parameters were studied.
      Outcome parameters like oral competence, tactile sensation, thermal sensitivity
      of reconstructed lip and speech outcomes were evaluated. RESULT: A functional
      outcome with 2-4 mm of two-point discrimination was obtained in 19 patients. All 
      patients had intelligible speech. A mean sulcus depth of 19.59 mm was achieved.
      One patient had partial flap loss owing to wound infection. CONCLUSION: Random
      pattern senate nasolabial flap offers a good functional outcome by maintaining
      the tactile and thermal sensitivity.

TI  - Circular RNA circLRCH3 promotes oxaliplatin resistance in gastric cancer through 
      the modulation of the miR-383-5p/FGF7 axis.
PG  - 18506
LID - 10.14670/HH-18-506 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer (GC) is a common malignant tumor of the digestive
      system. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play a vital role in tumorigenesis and
      chemoresistance. The current study aimed to explore the possible role and
      mechanism of circRNA leucine rich repeats and calponin homology domain containing
      3 (circLRCH3) in GC chemoresistance. METHODS: The levels of circLRCH3,
      microRNA-383-5p (miR-383-5p) and fibroblast growth factor 7 (FGF7) were
      determined by quantitative real-time PCR or Western blot. Cell Counting Kit-8
      (CCK-8) assay was utilized to evaluate cell survival rate and proliferation
      ability. Colony formation, transwell and flow cytometry assays were used to
      assess cell proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis. The expression of
      multidrug resistance proteins was detected by Western blot. The binding
      relationship between miR-383-5p and circLRCH3/FGF7 was verified by
      dual-luciferase reporter assay or RNA immunoprecipitation assay. Xenograft assay 
      was conducted to analyze the role of circLRCH3 in OXA resistance in vivo.
      RESULTS: CircLRCH3 and FGF7 levels were up-regulated, while miR-383-5p level was 
      reduced in OXA-resistant GC tissues and cells. Depletion of circLRCH3 attenuated 
      the resistance of OXA-resistant cells to OXA. CircLRCH3 silence reduced OXA
      resistance by regulating miR-383-5p. Besides, miR-383-5p elevated OXA sensitivity
      of GC cells by repressing FGF7. Moreover, the deletion of circLRCH3 increased OXA
      sensitivity in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Knockdown of circLRCH3 alleviated OXA
      resistance of GC by modulating the miR-383-5p/FGF7 axis, which provided a
      promising therapeutic target for GC chemoresistance.

      women.
PG  - 343-347
LID - 10.23736/S2724-606X.21.04971-X [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Abnormal uterine bleeding is a common cause of hospital admission in 
      perimenopausal women. It can be the first sign of many diseases such as
      endometrial cancer and endometrial hyperplasia. Endometrial sampling is valuable 
      in early diagnosis and treatment. Although hysterectomy is the gold standard in
      the diagnosis of endometrial pathology, it is not considered an acceptable method
      for diagnosis. With the principle of "see and treat, hysteroscopy seems to be the
      most successful method. METHODS: After obtaining the necessary ethics committee
      approval, we obtained liquid-based cytology samples of our perimenopausal
      patients who frequently applied to our outpatient clinic with abnormal uterine
      bleeding. To conduct endometrial sampling of our patients, we used pipelle
      aspiration method in our 75-disease group and direct hysteroscopic sampling
      method in our other 75 disease group. We then compared the pre- and postoperative
      pathology results. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference
      between preoperative and postoperative pathological results in both pipelle and
      hysteroscopic sampling groups. CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of endometrial pathologies
      by hysteroscopic method and pipelle method has high sensitivity and specificity. 
      Gynecologists may determine the method preference according to the status of the 
      health system together with their patients.

TI  - Needs assessment in head and neck surgical oncology training: A qualitative study
      of expert opinions.
LID - 10.1002/hed.27158 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Few studies have investigated the needs of head and neck surgery
      trainees and areas for improvement of fellowship programs. METHODS: We conducted 
      a qualitative study by interviewing a nationally representative sample of program
      directors and national leaders in head and neck surgery. We asked about the
      current state and strengths of training; and areas for further improvement. All
      interviews were independently coded and analyzed by two reviewers. RESULTS: All
      experts (100%) believed that the current training provides a strong foundation
      and furthermore, a standardized curriculum is beneficial. Multidisciplinary
      training (80%), participation in tumor boards (75%), and a syllabus (60%) were
      the most frequently mentioned components. Most believed that a formal
      certification process would be beneficial (73%), though there was no consensus on
      the format. CONCLUSION: Experts in head and neck surgery are generally in favor
      of a standardized curriculum. Further discussions of a formal certification
      process might be warranted.

TI  - A hypoxia-related lncRNA model for prediction of head and neck squamous cell
      carcinoma prognosis.
LID - 10.1002/cam4.5102 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is one of the most
      common and highly heterogeneous malignancies worldwide. Increasing studies have
      proven that hypoxia and related long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) are involved in the 
      occurrence and prognosis of HNSCC. The goal of this work is to construct a risk
      assessment model using hypoxia-related lncRNAs (hrlncRNAs) for HNSCC prognosis
      prediction and personalized treatment. METHODS: Transcriptome expression matrix, 
      clinical follow-up data, and somatic mutation data of HNSCC patients were
      obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We used co-expression analysis to
      identify hrlncRNAs, then screened for differentially expressed lncRNAs
      (DEhrlncRNAs), and paired these DEhrlncRNAs. The risk model was established
      through univariate, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and 
      stepwise multivariate Cox regression. Finally, we assessed the model from
      multiple perspectives of tumor mutation burden (TMB), tumor immune infiltration, 
      chemotherapeutic sensitivity, immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI), and functional
      enrichment. RESULTS: The risk assessment model included 14 hrlncRNA pairs. The
      risk score was observed to be a reliable prognostic factor. The high-risk
      patients had an unfavorable prognosis and significant differences from the
      low-risk group in TMB and tumor immune infiltration. In the high-risk patients,
      the common immune checkpoints were down-regulated, including CTLA4 and PDCD1, and
      the sensibility to paclitaxel and docetaxel was higher. The functional enrichment
      analysis suggested that the low-risk group was accompanied by activated immune
      function. CONCLUSIONS: The risk assessment model of 14-hrlncRNA-pairs
      demonstrated a promising prognostic prediction for HNSCC patients and can guide
      personalized clinical treatment.

TI  - Single-Center Results of Colorectal Procedures Performed with Fully Articulated
      Laparoscopic Artisential(R) Devices.
LID - sti41/1605 [pii]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The ArtiSential(R) line of products from LivsMed (Seongnam,
      Republic of Korea) are fully articulated hand-held laparoscopic instruments,
      possessing end-effectors that closely imitate those of surgical robots with
      regard to shape and dexterity. Feasibility and safety studies describing the
      initial experiences with these devices in upper and lower gastrointestinal as
      well as thoracic surgery have been published. This report presents the outcomes
      of the largest cohort to date of colorectal procedures performed with
      Artisential(R) instruments in a single center. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between
      September 2020 and May 2022, prospective data were collected from patients
      undergoing ArtiSential(R)-assisted laparoscopic surgery. A retrospective data
      analysis was performed for all patients who underwent ArtiSential(R)-assisted
      surgery for colorectal indication. Indications for colorectal surgery included
      rectal and colon cancer, complicated diverticular disease, inflammatory bowel
      disease, obstructed defecation syndrome, endoscopically nonresectable adenomas
      and chronic anastomotic fistula following a low anterior resection (LAR).
      RESULTS: A total of 73 patients (49 males, 24 females) underwent
      Artisential(R)-assisted colorectal surgery. The median age of the patients was 62
      years (range 34-88) and the median body mass index (BMI) was 27 kg/m2 (range
      19-51). Indications for surgery were colorectal malignancy (n=55, 75%),
      complicated diverticular disease (n=11, 15%), obstructed defecation syndrome
      (n=3, 4.1%), inflammatory bowel disease (n=2, 2.7%), endoscopically nonresectable
      adenomas (n=1, 1.4%) and chronic anastomotic fistula following LAR (n=1, 1.4%).
      The median operative time was 240 minutes (range 95-458). There were no
      conversions to standard straight-stick laparoscopy or to laparotomy, and no
      intraoperative complications. All patients who were operated upon for colorectal 
      malignancy had an adequate oncological resection (R0=100%). The median length of 
      stay was 7 days (range 3-36). The overall complication rate was 10.9 %
      (Clavien-Dindo II: 1 patient, Clavien-Dindo IIIb: 7 patients). There were two
      readmissions, one unrelated, and no mortalities. CONCLUSIONS: This larger series 
      confirms the results of previous reports on the safety and feasibility of
      Artisential(R) use in complex laparoscopic colorectal surgery. To examine
      potential benefits in outcome, comparative studies involving Artisential(R),
      robotic-assisted and standard laparoscopic surgery are needed.

TI  - Genome-wide analysis of colorectal cancer based on gene-based somatic copy number
      alterations during neoplastic progression within the same tumor.
LID - 10.1002/cam4.5117 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to elucidate the association between 
      neoplastic progression and somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) occurring
      within the same colorectal cancer (CRC) tumor. METHODS: We investigated SCNAs to 
      identify the progression from a high-grade intramucosal lesion (HGIL) to an
      invasive front lesion (IFL), via an invasive submucosal lesion (ISL), within the 
      same tumor using a crypt isolation method combined with a SNP array.
      Immunohistochemistry was also performed. RESULTS: We identified 51 amplified
      genes that potentially promote progression from HGIL to ISL and 6 amplified genes
      involved in the progression from ISL to IFL. Of the 51 genes involved in HGIL to 
      ISL progression, TORC1, MSLN, and STUB1, which are closely associated with CRC,
      were identified as candidate markers of submucosal invasion. However, no
      candidate genes were identified among the six genes associated with ISL to IFL
      progression. In addition, the number of total SCNAs and the number of gains were 
      correlated with cancer progression (from HGIL to IFL). Finally,
      immunohistochemistry revealed higher expression of TORC1, MSLN, and STUB1 in ISL 
      than in HGIL. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that specific SCNAs are required
      for acquisition of invasive ability in CRC, and the affected genes are potential 
      markers of invasion.

TI  - FOXL2 and FOXA1 cooperatively assemble on the TP53 promoter in alternative dimer 
      configurations.
LID - gkac673 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkac673 [doi]
AB  - Although both the p53 and forkhead box (FOX) family proteins are key
      transcription factors associated with cancer progression, their direct
      relationship is unknown. Here, we found that FOX family proteins bind to the
      non-canonical homotypic cluster of the p53 promoter region (TP53). Analysis of
      crystal structures of FOX proteins (FOXL2 and FOXA1) bound to the p53 homotypic
      cluster indicated that they interact with a 2:1 stoichiometry accommodated by
      FOX-induced DNA allostery. In particular, FOX proteins exhibited distinct
      dimerization patterns in recognition of the same p53-DNA; dimer formation of
      FOXA1 involved protein-protein interaction, but FOXL2 did not. Biochemical and
      biological functional analyses confirmed the cooperative binding of FOX proteins 
      to the TP53 promoter for the transcriptional activation of TP53. In addition,
      up-regulation of TP53 was necessary for FOX proteins to exhibit
      anti-proliferative activity in cancer cells. These analyses reveal the presence
      of a discrete characteristic within FOX family proteins in which FOX proteins
      regulate the transcription activity of the p53 tumor suppressor via cooperative
      binding to the TP53 promoter in alternative dimer configurations.

AB  - The predictive modeling literature for biomedical applications is dominated by
      biostatistical methods for survival analysis, and more recently some out of the
      box machine learning approaches. In this article, we show a presentation of a
      machine learning method appropriate for time-to-event modeling in the area of
      prostate cancer long-term disease progression. Using XGBoost adapted to long-term
      disease progression, we developed a predictive model for 118 788 patients with
      localized prostate cancer at diagnosis from the Department of Veterans Affairs
      (VA). Our model accounted for patient censoring. Harrell's c-index for our model 
      using only features available at the time of diagnosis was 0.757 95% confidence
      interval [0.756, 0.757]. Our results show that machine learning methods like
      XGBoost can be adapted to use accelerated failure time (AFT) with censoring to
      model long-term risk of disease progression. The long median survival justifies
      and requires censoring. Overall, we show that an existing machine learning
      approach can be used for AFT outcome modeling in prostate cancer, and more
      generally for other chronic diseases with long observation times.

TI  - Assessment of symptom intensity and psychological well-being of patients with
      advanced cancer undergoing palliative care in a Brazilian public hospital: A
      cross-sectional study.
PG  - 1-7
LID - 10.1017/S1478951522000967 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The characterization of clinical-emotional aspects of advanced cancer
      patients is essential for palliative care. To date, there is scarce information
      regarding the socio-demographic and clinical profiles, as well as the quality of 
      care given to hospitalized patients under this condition, particularly in South
      American countries. The objectives of this study were to analyze the
      socio-demographic profile, symptoms (including psychological well-being), and the
      quality of life of advanced cancer patients admitted to the oncology ward of the 
      General Hospital of the University of Campinas, Brazil. METHODS: In this
      cross-sectional study, patients were invited to fill the selected questionnaires 
      such as Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) and Palliative Care Outcome
      Scale (POS). Descriptive analyses were performed, regarding socio-demographic
      profile, symptoms, level of information over treatment aims, and quality-of-life 
      scores. RESULTS: Fifty-nine patients were included, of whom 29 were male and 30
      female, with a mean age of 58 years. Overall, 31.9% presented pain at the time of
      the interview, 52.5% depression, and 76.3% anxiety. The median individual scores 
      for ESAS and POS (and interquartile range) were, respectively, 27 (17-41) and 14 
      (9-19). Patients with previous knowledge of treatment objectives reported worse
      depression scores in the ESAS (median 2 vs. 0, p 0.02), even when correcting for 
      possible confounders. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: In contrast to current literature,
      in which pain is a prevalent report, depression and anxiety were more evident in 
      this specific population of hospitalized patients. This framework reflects the
      need for valuing not only physical but also emotional symptoms to achieve the
      integrality of care.

TI  - The NADPH oxidase NOX4 regulates redox and metabolic homeostasis preventing
      hepatocellular carcinoma progression.
LID - 10.1002/hep.32702 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The NADPH oxidase NOX4 plays a tumor suppressor function in
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Silencing NOX4 confers higher proliferative and
      migratory capacity to HCC cells and increases their in vivo tumorigenic potential
      in xenografts in mice. NOX4 gene deletions are frequent in HCC, correlating with 
      higher tumor grade and worse recurrence-free and overall survival rates. However,
      despite of the accumulating evidence of a protective regulatory role in HCC, the 
      cellular processes governed by NOX4 are not yet understood. Accordingly, the aim 
      of this work was to better understand the molecular mechanisms regulated by NOX4 
      in HCC in order to explain its tumor suppressor action. APPROACH & RESULTS:
      Cell-based loss- or gain-of- NOX4 function experiments, in vivo
      hepatocarcinogenesis induced by diethylnitrosamine (DEN) in Nox4 deficient mice, 
      and analyses in human HCC samples. Methods include cellular and molecular biology
      analyses, proteomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics, as well as histological 
      and immunohistochemical analyses in tissues. Results identified MYC as being
      negatively regulated by NOX4. MYC mediated mitochondrial dynamics and a
      transcriptional program leading to increased oxidative metabolism, enhanced use
      of both glucose and fatty acids and an overall higher energetic capacity and ATP 
      level. NOX4 deletion induced a redox imbalance that augmented Nrf2 activity and
      was responsible for MYC up-regulation. CONCLUSIONS: Loss of NOX4 in HCC tumor
      cells induces metabolic reprogramming in a Nrf2/MYC-dependent manner to promote
      HCC progression.

TI  - Mcm2 hypomorph leads to acute leukemia or hematopoietic stem cell failure,
      dependent on genetic context.
PG  - e22430
LID - 10.1096/fj.202200061RR [doi]
AB  - Minichromosome maintenance proteins (Mcm2-7) form a hexameric complex that
      unwinds DNA ahead of a replicative fork. The deficiency of Mcm proteins leads to 
      replicative stress and consequent genomic instability. Mice with a germline
      insertion of a Cre cassette into the 3'UTR of the Mcm2 gene (designated Mcm2(Cre)
      ) have decreased Mcm2 expression and invariably develop precursor T-cell
      lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (pre-T LBL), due to 100-1000 kb deletions
      involving important tumor suppressor genes. To determine whether mice that were
      protected from pre-T LBL would develop non-T-cell malignancies, we used two
      approaches. Mice engrafted with Mcm2(Cre/Cre) Lin(-) Sca-1(+) Kit(+)
      hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells did not develop hematologic malignancy;
      however, these mice died of hematopoietic stem cell failure by 6 months of age.
      Placing the Mcm2(Cre) allele onto an athymic nu/nu background completely
      prevented pre-T LBL and extended survival of these mice three-fold (median 296.5 
      vs. 80.5 days). Ultimately, most Mcm2(Cre/Cre) ;nu/nu mice developed B-cell
      precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). We identified recurrent
      deletions of 100-1000 kb that involved genes known or suspected to be involved in
      BCP-ALL, including Pax5, Nf1, Ikzf3, and Bcor. Moreover, whole-exome sequencing
      identified recurrent mutations of genes known to be involved in BCP-ALL
      progression, such as Jak1/Jak3, Ptpn11, and Kras. These findings demonstrate that
      an Mcm2(Cre/Cre) hypomorph can induce hematopoietic dysfunction via hematopoietic
      stem cell failure as well as a "deletor" phenotype affecting known or suspected
      tumor suppressor genes.

TI  - Immune checkpoint inhibitors as first line in advanced melanoma: Evaluating
      progression-free survival based on reconstructed individual patient data.
LID - 10.1002/cam4.5067 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In patients with advanced melanoma, immune-checkpoint inhibitors
      (ICIs) represent the mainstay for first line treatment. Recently,
      relatlimab+nivolumab was proposed as a new combination therapy. This review was
      aimed at summarizing the current data of effectiveness for ICIs. Progression-free
      survival (PFS) was the endpoint of our analysis. METHODS: After a standard
      literature search, Phase II/III studies comparing different ICI regimens in
      previously untreated advanced melanoma patients were analyzed. Patient-level data
      were reconstructed from Kaplan-Meier curves by application of the IPDfromKM
      method. These reconstructed datasets were used to perform indirect comparisons
      between treatments. Standard statistical testing was used, including hazard ratio
      and medians. A secondary analysis employed the restricted mean survival time.
      RESULTS: Six trials were included in our analysis. Information on PFS from these 
      trials was pooled according to the following treatments: nivolumab or
      pembrolizumab as monotherapy, or in combination with ipilimumab, and relatlimab +
      nivolumab. Pembrolizumab+ipilimumab showed significantly better PFS compared with
      the other treatments; nivolumab+ipilimumab ranked second; the other treatments
      showed a similar survival pattern. CONCLUSIONS: The picture of comparative
      effectiveness resulting from our analysis is complex. The IPDfromKM method is
      advantageous because it accounts for the length of follow-up but loses the
      balance between treatment group and controls determined by randomization. Based
      on indirect comparisons, the combination of pembrolizumab+ipilimumab showed a
      particularly high efficacy, and so deserves further investigation. While the
      effect of between-trial differences in inclusion criteria plays an important
      role, our results do not support the proposal of relatlimab+nivolumab as a new
      standard of care.

PG  - 1-5
LID - 10.1080/03630269.2022.2059671 [doi]
AB  - Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only established
      treatment that is potentially curative, but it is limited by the availability of 
      donors and the medical condition of the patient. To expand the donor pool to
      include haploidentical related donors, we introduced a program consisting of a
      pharmacologic pre transplant immune suppression phase (PTIS) and two courses of
      dexamethasone (DXM) and fludarabine (FLU) followed by pre transplant conditioning
      with intravenous FLU busulfan (BU) and post transplant graft-vs.-host disease
      (GvHD) prophylaxis with cyclophosphamide (CPM), tacrolimus, and mycophenolate
      mofetil. We transplanted 83 consecutive transfusion-dependent patients with
      thalassemia; the 3-year projected overall and event-free survival is over 96.0%, 
      and there have been no secondary graft failures. Of the first 31 patients, we had
      two graft failures, both of them occurring in patients with extremely high titers
      of anti-donor-specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies [anti-donor
      specific antibodies (DSAs)], but after adjusting the PTIS to include bortezomib
      (BORT) and rituximab (RIX) for patients with high titers of anti-DSAs and using
      pharmacologic dose guidance for BU, we had no graft failures in the last 52
      patients. Six (7.0%) of 83 patients developed severe GvHD. We conclude that this 
      is a safe and efficacious approach to allogeneic HSCT in thalassemia.

TI  - Tieing together loose ends: telomere instability in cancer and aging.
LID - 10.1002/1878-0261.13299 [doi]
AB  - Telomere maintenance is essential for maintaining genome integrity in both normal
      and cancer cells. Without functional telomeres, chromosomes lose their protective
      structure, and undergo fusion and breakage events that drive further genome
      instability, including cell arrest or death. One means by which this loss can be 
      overcome in stem cells and cancer cells is via re-addition of G-rich telomeric
      repeats by the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT). During aging of somatic
      tissues, however, insufficient telomerase expression leads to a proliferative
      arrest called replicative senescence, which is triggered when telomeres reach a
      critically short threshold that induces a DNA damage response. Cancer cells
      express telomerase but do not entirely escape telomere instability as they often 
      possess short telomeres; hence there is often selection for genetic alterations
      in the TERT promoter that result in increased telomerase expression. In this
      review, we discuss our current understanding of the consequences of telomere
      instability in cancer and aging, and outline the opportunities and challenges
      that lie ahead in exploiting the reliance of cells on telomere maintenance for
      preserving genome stability.

TI  - Development and external validation of a novel nomogram to predict prostate
      cancer in biopsy-naive patients with PSA <10 ng/ml and PI-RADS v2.1 = 3 lesions.
LID - 10.1002/cam4.5100 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop and externally validate a novel nomogram in biopsy-naive
      patients with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) <10 ng/ml and PI-RADS v2.1 = 3
      lesions. METHODS: We retrospectively collected 307 men that underwent initial
      biopsy from October 2015 to January 2022 in Cohort 1 (The First Affiliated
      Hospital of Soochow University). External cohort (Cohort 2, Kunshan Hospital)
      included 109 men that met our criteria from July 2016 to June 2021. By Slicer-3D 
      Software, the volume of all lesions was divided into two subgroups (PI-RADS v2.1 
      = 3a and 3b). Logistic regression analysis was performed to screen for variables 
      and construct nomogram by analyzing clinical data from Cohort 1. Receiver
      operating characteristics curve analysis, calibration plot and decision curve
      analysis (DCA) were plotted to validate the nomogram in external cohort. RESULTS:
      A total of 70 (22.8%) patients was diagnosed with prostate cancer in Institution 
      1. Among them, 34 (11.1%) had clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa).
      Age, prostate-specific antigen density, digital rectal examination, PI-RADS v2.1 
      = 3 subgroups (3a and 3b) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC, <750 mm(2) /s)
      were predictive factors for prostate cancer (PCa) and csPCa. High area under the 
      curve of the nomogram was found in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 for PCa (0.857 vs.
      0.850) and for csPCa (0.896 vs. 0.893). Calibration curves showed excellent
      agreement between the predicted probability and actual risk for the models in
      internal and external validation. The DCA demonstrated net benefit of our
      nomogram. CONCLUSION: Until now, this is the first nomogram that predicts PCa and
      csPCa in biopsy-naive patients with PSA <10 ng/ml and PI-RADS v2.1 = 3 lesions.
      Furthermore, PI-RADS v2.1 = 3 subgroups were considered to be an independent risk
      factor in our model. Our nomogram may assist urologists in biopsy decision making
      for these so-called "double gray zone" patients.

TI  - Low-dose of magnesium sulfate solution was not inferior to standard regime of
      polyethylene glycol for bowel preparation in elderly patients: a randomized,
      controlled study.
PG  - 1-7
LID - 10.1080/00365521.2022.2106154 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Large polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a standard regimen for bowel
      preparation. However, elderly patients suffered from adverse events. This study
      was to compare the efficacy and safety of oral magnesium sulfate solution (MSS)
      vs standard PEG in elderly patients undergoing colonoscopy. METHODS: Elderly
      patients aged 60-90 years, from two endoscopic centers, were enrolled in China.
      Patients were randomized to take a low dose of MSS or a standard PEG regime in a 
      split-dose regime. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with
      adequate bowel preparation, which was defined as the total Boston Bowel
      Preparation Scale (BBPS) >/=6 and each segmental BBPS was >/=2. Secondary
      outcomes included adenoma detection rate (ADR), safety, adverse events, cecal
      intubation rate, willingness to repeat BP, and so on. RESULTS: 1174 elderly
      patients were randomly allocated to the MSS group (n = 588) or the standard group
      (n = 586). Adequate BP was achieved in 94.0% of patients in the MSS group and
      92.5% in the control (p = .287). ADR was also comparable between the two groups
      (43.0% and 39.9%, p = .282). Compared with the standard group, MSS group reported
      less abdominal discomfort (1.7% vs 6.0%), less nausea (13.6% vs 21.0%) and
      vomiting (1.2% vs 4.2%). The change in serum potassium levels after preparation
      in the standard group was significantly lower than that in the MSS group (-0.19
      +/- 0.08 vs -0.41 +/- 0.11, p = .037). CONCLUSIONS: Low dose of MSS was not
      inferior to the standard PEG regime in terms of bowel preparation quality for
      elderly patients. Low-dose MSS offered fewer adverse events and better
      tolerability. It is a preferable choice for the elderly to undergo bowel
      preparation for colonoscopy. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04948567.

TI  - Exploiting Minimalistic Backbone Engineered gamma-Phenylalanine for the Formation
      of Supramolecular Co-Polymer.
PG  - e2200223
LID - 10.1002/marc.202200223 [doi]
AB  - Ordered supramolecular hydrogels assembled by modified aromatic amino acids often
      exhibit low mechanical rigidity. Aiming to stabilize the hydrogel and understand 
      the impact of conformational freedom and hydrophobicity on the self-assembly
      process, we designed two building blocks based on
      9-fluorenyl-methoxycarbonyl-phenylalanine (Fmoc-Phe) gelator which contain two
      extra methylene units in the backbone, generating Fmoc-gammaPhe and
      Fmoc-(3-hydroxy)-gammaPhe. Fmoc-gammaPhe spontaneously assembled in aqueous media
      forming a hydrogel with exceptional mechanical and thermal stability. Moreover,
      Fmoc-(3-hydroxy)-gammaPhe, with an extra backbone hydroxyl group decreasing its
      hydrophobicity while maintaining some molecular flexibility, self-assembled into 
      a transient fibrillar hydrogel, that later formed microcrystalline aggregates
      through phase transition. Molecular dynamics simulations and single crystal X-ray
      analyses revealed the mechanism underlying the two residues' distinct
      self-assembly behaviors. Finally, we demonstrated Fmoc-gammaPhe and
      Fmoc-(3-OH)-gammaPhe co-assembly to form a supramolecular hydrogel with notable
      mechanical properties. We believe that the understanding of the
      structure-assembly relationship will enable the design of new functional amino
      acid-based hydrogels. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze patients undergoing redo liver resections for metastatic
      colorectal cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 14 patients with
      colorectal cancer who underwent several redo liver resections for metastatic
      lesions between September 2011 and June 2021. Mean age of patients was 63.5
      years. Left-sided colonic G2 adenocarcinoma T4N1-2 prevailed (wild-type KRAS).
      RESULTS: Fourteen patients (100%) underwent two liver resections, 7 (50%) - three
      resections, 1 (7.1%) - four resections. Mean period between the first and the
      second liver resections was 16.2 months, between the second and the third
      resections - 9.9 months, between the third and the fourth resections - 5 months. 
      Maximum follow-up period after primary surgery was 9 years and 9 months.
      Seventy-five percent of patients were alive after 34.2 months, 50% - after 58.9
      months. N+ status of colorectal tumor decreased survival while KRAS mutation and 
      synchronous metastatic liver lesions increased survival. CONCLUSION: Redo liver
      resections for metastatic colorectal cancer are safe and ensure favorable
      long-term survival in certain patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of platelet variation coefficient in prediction
      of severity of acute pancreatitis (AP). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 
      90 patients with AP who admitted to the Tula City Emergency Hospital between 2018
      and 2019. Patients had no signs of renal and hepatic insufficiency, cancer, blood
      diseases, inherited platelet disorders, previous splenectomy, antiplatelet and
      anticoagulant therapy. Mortality of patients with mild-to-moderate AP was 0%,
      severe pancreatic necrosis - 5.26%, extremely severe pancreatic necrosis - 92.3%.
      We analyzed the number and volume of platelets, thrombocytocrit and
      volume-adjusted distribution of platelets. All parameters were assessed after 1, 
      3, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35 days. RESULT: There was a significant correlation between
      AP severity and the number, volume and volume-adjusted distribution of platelets.
      Reduced platelet count, enlarged cells and heterogeneous volumes of platelets
      indicate severe course of pancreatitis. Identification of these changes as early 
      as 3 days of disease is of great clinical importance. Platelet variation
      coefficient (PVC) is proposed to predict severity of AP. We found a direct
      correlation between IL-6 and PVC (correlation coefficient 0.78). CONCLUSION: The 
      proposed PVC is available and easy to use for prediction of AP severity. It
      allows you to assess the course of acute destructive pancreatitis and
      effectiveness of treatment after the first three days of therapy. You can improve
      prediction of AP using this value.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate postoperative outcomes in patients with chest wall
      metastases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analyzed 40 patients who underwent surgery
      for chest wall metastatic lesions. Fourteen (35%) patients had sternal lesion, 26
      (65%) ones - rib metastases. We used implants for chest wall defect closure in 15
      (37.5%) patients. Chest wall repair with autologous tissues was performed in 19
      (47.5%) patients. RESULTS: Median survival was 17 months. Most patients (n=30,
      75%) showed improvement in the quality of life according to Karnofsky and EGOG
      scale after surgery. Continued tumor growth occurred in 4 (10%) patients within
      8-16 months after surgery. There were 2 patients who suffered from tumor
      recurrence accompanied by other metastatic foci (progression). Complications were
      diagnosed in 5 (12.5%) patients. Tactical errors were identified in 4 (10%)
      patients and they were associated with progression of cancer in the form of new
      metastatic foci within 6 months after surgery. CONCLUSION: Active surgical
      approach for bone metastases in patients with favorable cancer-related prognosis 
      can improve quality of life and survival at least in case of solitary lesions.
      New program for treatment strategy selection based on prognosis of life
      expectancy and algorithms of surgical treatment will reduce the risk of erroneous
      management and increase its effectiveness.

PG  - 12-24
LID - 10.17116/hirurgia202208112 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the main forms of primary tracheal cancer (PTC), to
      specify the indications for various surgeries in these patients depending on
      extent and localization of lesion. MATERIAL AND METHODS: There were 263 PTC
      patients. Benign tumors were diagnosed in 68 (25.9%) patients, malignancies - in 
      195 (74.1%) cases. Tracheal cancer includes 3 basic morphological variants -
      adenocystic cancer (49.7%), carcinoid (18.7%) and squamous cell carcinoma
      (19.0%). Other forms of malignancies were much less common. We applied endoscopic
      intraluminal and open surgeries. In malignant PTC, open surgeries were performed 
      in 165 (84.6%) out of 195 patients. Baseline palliative endoscopic treatment was 
      performed in 30 patients. They underwent airway recanalization (with subsequent
      tracheal stenting in 19 patients). Endoscopic resection was preferred for benign 
      tumors. RESULTS: Twenty (12.1%) patients died after open surgery, and 1 (3.3%)
      patient died after endoscopic procedure. Most lethal outcomes occurred in early
      years of development of tracheal surgery. The causes of mortality were tracheal
      anastomotic failure in 12 patients, pneumonia in 6 patients, and arterial
      bleeding in 2 patients. Severe postoperative period was observed in all 3
      patients after tracheal replacement with a silicone prosthesis. Long-term
      treatment outcomes depended on morphological structure of PTC. Favorable results 
      were observed in patients with neuroendocrine tumor (carcinoid), worse outcomes
      in adenocystic cancer and unfavorable results in squamous cell carcinoma
      (p<0.0013). Five-year survival rates were 75%, 65.6%, and 13.3%; 10-year survival
      rates were 75%, 56.2%, and 13.3%, respectively. These outcomes after combined
      treatment of primary tracheal cancer were significantly better compared to lung
      cancer (p<0.05 when compared to global data). CONCLUSION: Treatment of primary
      tracheal cancer should be based on classical principles of modern oncology
      (combined therapy, tumor resection with lymphadenectomy). Open and endoscopic
      interventions are justified. PTC is characterized by more favorable outcomes
      compared to lung cancer. It is difficult to analyze long-term results in tracheal
      cancer depending on various features of tumor process due to small number of
      observations. Accurate conclusions require multiple-center studies, preferably
      with international participation, which can convincingly prove certain concept.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a perspective method of
      organ-sparing treatment of benign colon tumors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study
      included 1.000 patients with colon neoplasms who underwent ESD between October
      2016 and October 2021. All surgeries were performed under intravenous sedation.
      RESULTS: Mean dimension of tumors was 3.4 cm, median of surgery time - 51 (31;
      101) minutes. Conversion of endoscopic approach occurred in 7.6% of cases. The
      main cause of conversion was unsatisfactory lifting in submucosal injection
      process. Incidence of en bloc and R0 resections was 84.1% and 68.3%,
      respectively. Postoperative morbidity was 2.9% that correlates with the world
      literature data. CONCLUSION: Endoscopic submucosal dissection is an effective and
      safe method for benign colon neoplasms. Considering high incidence of en bloc
      resection and low rate of local recurrence in benign neoplasms, further research 
      of efficacy and safety of ESD in early colon cancer is needed.

TI  - Tuning intramolecular charge transfer and spin-orbit coupling of AIE-active
      type-I photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy.
LID - 10.1039/d2tb01224c [doi]
AB  - Development of photosensitizers (PSs) featuring type-I reactive oxygen species
      (ROS) with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) properties is a judicious approach 
      to overcome the deficit of conventional photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, it
      remains a challenge to design AIE-active type-I ROS PSs using a simple
      theranostic scaffold paired with a delicate balance between intramolecular charge
      transfer (ICT) and large spin-orbit coupling (SOC) features to facilitate
      intersystem crossing (ISC) and hence to intensify triplet excitons for type-I ROS
      generation as well as to improve optical properties for the desired biomedical
      applications. In this work, a rationally designed series of PSs based on
      C-6-substituted tetraphenylethylene-fused benzothiazole-coumarin scaffolds, named
      TPE-nCUMs, were synthesized via a fused-ring-electron-acceptor (FREA) strategy,
      endowed with AIE properties in aqueous solution and thus self-monitoring type-I
      ROS generation under white-light irradiation to study the effects of diverse ICT 
      and SOC potentials on their photochemical and optical properties. Both
      experimental and theoretical results revealed that the concomitantly increasing
      strengths of both ICT and SOC features promote type-I ROS generation by
      TPE-nCUMs. The key role of the SOC-promoting carbonyl group towards the ROS
      generation ability of TPE-nCUMs was then examined. Among TPE-nCUMs,
      gem-2OMe-TPE-2CUM displayed highly efficient type-I ROS generation. Importantly, 
      gem-OMe-TPE-1CUM acts as a fluorescent indicator in HeLa cells (in vitro),
      revealing its excellent diffusion capability in both lysosomal and mitochondrial 
      organelles with low dark toxicity, high cytotoxicity under white-light and
      remarkable PDT efficiency. Our study has thus elucidated a rationally designed
      strategy at the molecular level to fine-tune ICT and SOC features for the advance
      of AIE-active type-I ROS PSs, opening a new avenue for cancer treatment and
      image-guided therapy.

TI  - The risk of tibial eminence avulsion fracture with bi-unicondylar knee
      arthroplasty : a finite element analysis.
PG  - 575-584
LID - 10.1302/2046-3758.118.BJR-2021-0533.R1 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to determine the risk of tibial eminence avulsion
      intraoperatively for bi-unicondylar knee arthroplasty (Bi-UKA), with
      consideration of the effect of implant positioning, overstuffing, and sex,
      compared to the risk for isolated medial unicondylar knee arthroplasty (UKA-M)
      and bicruciate-retaining total knee arthroplasty (BCR-TKA). METHODS: Two
      experimentally validated finite element models of tibia were implanted with
      UKA-M, Bi-UKA, and BCR-TKA. Intraoperative loads were applied through the
      condyles, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), medial collateral ligament (MCL), and
      lateral collateral ligament (LCL), and the risk of fracture (ROF) was evaluated
      in the spine as the ratio of the 95(th) percentile maximum principal elastic
      strains over the tensile yield strain of proximal tibial bone. RESULTS: Peak
      tensile strains occurred on the anterior portion of the medial sagittal cut in
      all simulations. Lateral translation of the medial implant in Bi-UKA had the
      largest increase in ROF of any of the implant positions (43%). Overstuffing the
      joint by 2 mm had a much larger effect, resulting in a six-fold increase in ROF. 
      Bi-UKA had ~10% increased ROF compared to UKA-M for both the male and female
      models, although the smaller, less dense female model had a 1.4 times greater ROF
      compared to the male model. Removal of anterior bone akin to BCR-TKA doubled ROF 
      compared to Bi-UKA. CONCLUSION: Tibial eminence avulsion fracture has a similar
      risk associated with Bi-UKA to UKA-M. The risk is higher for smaller and less
      dense tibiae. To minimize risk, it is most important to avoid overstuffing the
      joint, followed by correctly positioning the medial implant, taking care not to
      narrow the bone island anteriorly.Cite this article: Bone Joint Res

TI  - MRNIP interacts with sex body chromatin to support meiotic progression,
      spermatogenesis, and male fertility in mice.
PG  - e22479
LID - 10.1096/fj.202101168RR [doi]
AB  - Meiosis has a principal role in sexual reproduction to generate haploid gametes
      in both sexes. During meiosis, the cell nucleus hosts a dynamic environment where
      some genes are transcriptionally activated, and some are inactivated at the same 
      time. This becomes possible through subnuclear compartmentalization. The sex
      body, sequestering X and Y chromosomes during male meiosis and creating an
      environment for the meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) is one of the best
      known and studied subnuclear compartments. Herein, we show that MRNIP forms
      droplet-like accumulations that fuse together to create a distinct subnuclear
      compartment that partially overlaps with the sex body chromatin during diplotene.
      We demonstrate that Mrnip(-/-) spermatocytes have impaired DNA double-strand
      break (DSB) repair, they display reduced sex body formation and defective MSCI.
      We show that Mrnip(-/-) undergoes critical meiocyte loss at the diplotene stage. 
      Furthermore, we determine that DNA DSBs (induced by SPO11) and synapsis
      initiation (facilitated by SYCP1) precede Mrnip expression in testes. Altogether,
      our findings indicate that in addition to an emerging role in DNA DSB repair,
      MRNIP has an essential function in spermatogenesis during meiosis I by forming
      drop-like accumulations interacting with the sex body.

TI  - PHD3 inhibits cell proliferation through hydroxylation of PAX2 at proline 9.
PG  - 708-715
LID - 10.3724/abbs.2022043 [doi]
AB  - The oncoprotein transcription factor paired box 2 (PAX2) is aberrantly expressed 
      in cancers, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Prolyl hydroxylase 3
      (PHD3) hydroxylates the proline residue of HIFalpha, mediating HIFalpha
      degradation. The von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL) is an E3 ligase which mediates 
      ubiquitination and degradation of hydroxylated HIFalpha. PHD3 and pVHL are found 
      to inhibit the expression of PAX2, however, the molecular mechanism is unclear.
      Here we demonstrate that PHD3 hydroxylates PAX2 at proline 9, which is required
      for pVHL to mediate PAX2 ubiquitination and degradation. Overexpression of PHD3
      enhances prolyl hydroxylation, ubiquitination and degradation of PAX2 with little
      effect on those of PAX2(P9A). PHD3 does not influence PAX2 expression in VHL-null
      cells. pVHL binds to PAX2 and enhances PAX2 ubiquitination and degradation.
      However, pVHL does not bind with PAX2(P9A) and cannot enhance its ubiquitination 
      and degradation. Our results suggest that proline 9 hydroxylation is a
      prerequisite for PAX2 degradation by pVHL. Functional studies indicate that
      introduction of PAX2 into PAX2-null COS-7 cells promotes cell proliferation,
      which is suppressed by co-expression of PHD3 but not by hydroxylase-deficient
      PHD3(H196A). PHD3 inhibits PAX2-induced, but not PAX2(P9A)-induced proliferation 
      of COS-7 cells. These results suggest that PHD3 hydroxylates PAX2, followed by
      pVHL-mediated PAX2 ubiquitination and degradation. This study also suggests that 
      PHD3 inhibits cell proliferation through downregulating PAX2.

TI  - Targeting PIM2 by JP11646 results in significant antitumor effects in solid
      tumors.
LID - 10.3892/ijo.2022.5404 [doi]
LID - 114 [pii]
AB  - Proviral integration of Moloney virus 2 (PIM2) is a prosurvival factor of cancer 
      cells and a possible therapeutic target in hematological malignancies. However,
      the attempts at inhibiting PIM2 have yielded underwhelming results in early
      clinical trials on hematological malignancies. Recently, a novel panPIM
      inhibitor, JP11646, was developed. The present study examined the utility of
      targeting PIM2 in multiple solid cancers and investigated the antitumor efficacy 
      and the mechanisms of action of JP11646. When PIM2 expression was compared
      between normal and cancer tissues in publicly available datasets, PIM2 was found 
      to be overexpressed in several types of solid cancers. PIM2 ectopic
      overexpression promoted tumor growth in in vivo xenograft breast cancer mouse
      models. The panPIM inhibitor, JP11646, suppressed in vitro cancer cell
      proliferation in a concentrationdependent manner in multiple types of cancers; a 
      similar result was observed with siRNAmediated PIM2 knockdown, as well as an
      increased in cell apoptosis. By contrast, another panPIM inhibitor, AZD1208,
      suppressed the expression of downstream PIM2 targets, but not PIM2 protein
      expression, corresponding to no apoptosis induction. As a mechanism of PIM2
      protein degradation, it was found that the proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib,
      reversed the apoptosis induced by JP11646, suggesting that PIM2 degradation by
      JP11646 is proteasomedependent. JP11646 exhibited significant anticancer efficacy
      with minimal toxicities at the examined doses and schedules in multiple in vivo
      mice xenograft solid cancer models. On the whole, the present study demonstrates 
      that PIM2 promotes cancer progression in solid tumors. JP11646 induces apoptosis 
      at least partly by PIM2 protein degradation and suppresses cancer cell
      proliferation in vitro and in vivo. JP11646 may thus be a possible treatment
      strategy for multiple types of solid cancers.

AB  - Following the publication of this paper, it was drawn to the Editors' attention
      by a concerned reader that certain of the cell migration assay data shown in Fig.
      2C were strikingly similar to data that had appeared in different form in another
      article by different authors. Owing to the fact that the contentious data in the 
      above article had already been published elsewhere prior to its submission to

TI  - Synergistic effects of thalidomide and cisplatin are mediated via the PI3K/AKT
      and JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathways in cervical cancer.

AB  - Thalidomide (THD) has been found to synergize with cisplatin (DDP) in certain
      types of cancers; however, their combined use in the treatment of cervical cancer
      has not been reported to date, at least to the best of our knowledge. Thus, the
      present study aimed to explore the synergistic effects of THD and DDP and
      determine their regulatory effects on the phosphoinositide 3kinase (PI3K)/protein
      kinase B (AKT) and Janus kinase 1 (JAK1)/signal transducer and activator of
      transcription 3 (STAT3) pathways in cervical cancer. For this purpose, 0160
      microM THD and 064 microM DDP monotherapy or in combination were used to treat
      the HeLa and SiHa cervical cancer cell lines. This was followed by the
      calculation of the combination index (CI) and 160 microM THD and 16 microM DDP
      were then used to treat the cells. Relative cell viability and apoptosis, as well
      as the mRNA and protein levels of PI3K, AKT, JAK1 and STAT3 were evaluated. The
      results revealed that THD and DDP monotherapy suppressed the viability of the
      HeLa and SiHa cells in a concentrationdependent manner. Moreover, THD and DDP
      treatment exerted a more prominent suppressive effect on the relative viability
      of HeLa and SiHa cells compared with DDP monotherapy at several concentration
      settings; further CI calculation revealed that the optimal synergistic
      concentrations were 160 microM for THD and 16 microM for DDP. Subsequently,
      combined treatment with THD and DDP suppressed relative cell viability, whereas
      it promoted cell apoptosis compared with THD or DPP monotherapy; it also
      inhibited the PI3K/AKT and JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathways compared with DPP or THD
      monotherapy in both HeLa and SiHa cells. On the whole, the present study
      demonstrated that THD synergizes with DDP to exert suppressive effects on
      cervical cancer cell lines. This synergistic action also inactivated the PI3K/AKT
      and JAK1/STAT3 pathways. Thus, these findings suggest that the combined use of
      THD and DPP may have potential for use in the treatment of cervical cancer.

TI  - Analysis of CXCL8 and its receptors CXCR1/CXCR2 at the mRNA level in neoplastic
      tissue, as well as in serum and peritoneal fluid in patients with ovarian cance.

AB  - Understanding the relationship between the coexistence of inflammatory and
      neoplastic processes in ovarian cancer, particularly those involving chemokines
      and their receptors, may help to elucidate the involvement of the studied
      parameters in tumor pathogenesis and could lead to improved clinical
      applications. Therefore, the present study aimed to analyze the levels of CXC
      motif chemokine ligand 8 (CXCL8), and its receptors CXC chemokine receptor
      (CXCR)1 and CXCR2, in the serum and peritoneal fluid of women with ovarian
      cancer, and to evaluate the association between the expression of these
      parameters in tumor tissue and patient characteristics, particularly the degree
      of histological differentiation. The study group included women with ovarian
      cancer diagnosed with serous cystadenocarcinoma International Federation of
      Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IIIc and a control group, which consisted of
      women who were diagnosed with a benign lesion (serous cystadenoma). The
      transcript levels of CXCL8, CXCR1 and CXCR2 were evaluated using reverse
      transcriptionquantitative PCR (RTqPCR). The quantitative analysis was carried out
      using the LightCycler(R) 480 System and GoTaq(R) 1Step RTqPCR System, according
      to the manufacturers' instructions. The concentration of CXCL8 in serum and
      peritoneal fluid was determined using a Human Interleukin8 ELISA kit, and the
      concentrations of CXCR1 and CXCR2 were determined using the CLOUDCLONE ELISA kit.
      Local and systemic disturbances in immune and inflammatory responses involving
      the CXCL8 chemokine and its receptors indicated the involvement of these studied 
      parameters in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer. Immunoregulation of the
      CXCL8CXCR1 system may influence the course of the inflammatory process
      accompanying ovarian cancer development, which may result in the identification
      of novel clinical applications; however, further studies are required.

TI  - HHLA2 promotes tumor progression by long noncoding RNA H19 in human gallbladder
      cancer.
LID - 10.3892/ijo.2022.5402 [doi]
LID - 112 [pii]
AB  - Advanced gallbladder cancer (GBC) is one of the most malignant of all types of
      biliary tract cancers that is associated with poor prognosis and high mortality. 
      Accumulating evidence suggest that the B7 family of proteins serve an essential
      role in various types of cancers, including GBC. However, the potential function 
      and regulatory mechanism of human endogenous retrovirusH long terminal
      repeatassociating protein 2 (HHLA2; also known as B7H7 or B7H5) in GBC remain
      poorly understood. In the present study, immunohistochemistry was used to examine
      the expression pattern of HHLA2 in samples from 89 patients with GBC. The
      possible association between HHLA2 expression and the clinicopathological
      parameters, including prognosis, were then assessed. Using lentiviruses,
      overexpression of HHLA2 plasmid or shorthairpin RNA (shRNA) of HHLA2 were
      transfected into GBCSD cells to overexpress or knock down HHLA2 expression,
      respectively. The effects of HHLA2 overexpression and knockdown on the
      epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT) process on GBCSD cells were measured by
      the western blotting and immunofluorescence staining of collagen I, Ncadherin,
      Ecadherin, vimentin and alphaSMA. By contrast, changes in cell proliferation were
      measured using EdU assay. Cell invasion and migration were assessed using
      Transwell and woundhealing assays, respectively. In addition, a xenograft mouse
      model was established to evaluate the tumorigenic ability of the GBC cell line in
      vivo after stable transfection with lentivirus for HHLA2 overexpression or shRNA 
      for HHLA2 knockdown. The regulatory relationships among TGFbeta1, long noncoding 
      RNA (lncRNA) H19 (H19) and HHLA2 were then investigated. The mRNA expression of
      lncRNA H19 were assessed using reverse transcriptionquantitative PCR, whereas the
      expression levels of HHLA2 were detected by western blotting and
      immunofluorescence staining. HHLA2 expression was found to gradually increase as 
      the stages of the GBC samples become more advanced. In addition, the expression
      level of HHLA2 was calculated to be positively associated with the Nevin stage,
      American Joint Committee on Cancer stage, tumor invasion and regional lymph node 
      metastasis but was negatively associated with the overall patient survival (OS). 
      In vitro experiments demonstrated that overexpression of HHLA2 promoted GBC
      migration, invasion, proliferation and EMT, whereas in vivo experiments found a
      promoting role of HHLA2 overexpression on GBC tumor growth. After transfection
      with lentiviruses encoding the overexpression plasmid of lncRNA H19, GBC
      migration, invasion, proliferation and EMT were increased. By contrast, knocking 
      down HHLA2 expression suppressed TGFbeta1 or lncRNA H19 overexpressioninduced GBC
      migration, invasion, proliferation and EMT. In addition, HHLA2 knockdown
      significantly reduced the sizes of the GBC tumors in vivo. These results suggest 
      that HHLA2 overexpression can promote GBC progression. Conversely, ablation of
      HHLA2 expression inhibited both TGFbeta1 and lncRNA H19induced GBC progression,
      suggesting that HHLA2 is a potential therapeutic target for this disease.

TI  - BMI trajectories, morbidity, and mortality in England: a two-step approach to
      estimating consequences of changes in BMI.
LID - 10.1002/oby.23510 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: BMI is known to have an association with morbidities and mortality.
      Many studies have argued that identifying health risks using single BMI measures 
      has limitations, particularly in older adults, and that changes in BMI can help
      to identify risks. This study identifies distinct BMI trajectories and their
      association with the risks of a range of morbidities and mortality. METHODS: The 
      English Longitudinal Study of Aging provides data on BMI, mortality, and
      morbidities between 1998 and 2015, sampled from adults over 50 years of age. This
      study uses a growth-mixture model and discrete-time survival analysis, combined
      using a two-step approach, which is novel in this setting, to the authors'
      knowledge. RESULTS: This study identified four trajectories: "stable overweight,"
      "elevated BMI," "increasing BMI," and "decreasing BMI." No differences in
      mortality, cancer, or stroke risk were found between these trajectories. BMI
      trajectories were significantly associated with the risks of diabetes, asthma,
      arthritis, and heart problems. CONCLUSIONS: These results emphasize the
      importance of looking at change in BMI alongside most recent BMI; BMI
      trajectories should be considered where possible when assessing health risks. The
      results suggest that established BMI thresholds should not be used in isolation
      to identify health risks, particularly in older adults.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of dilpacimab (ABT-165) versus bevacizumab plus FOLFIRI in
      metastatic colorectal cancer: a phase II study.
LID - 10.2217/fon-2021-1603 [doi]
AB  - Aim: This phase II study investigated safety and efficacy of dilpacimab or
      bevacizumab plus FOLFIRI in patients with previously treated metastatic
      colorectal cancer (mCRC). Materials & methods: Overall, 66 patients were treated 
      (n = 34 dilpacimab + FOLFIRI; n = 32 bevacizumab + FOLFIRI). Progression-free
      survival, overall survival, response rates and tolerability were assessed.
      Results: Median progression-free survival for dilpacimab + FOLFIRI compared with 
      bevacizumab + FOLFIRI was 3.78 months (95% CI: 2.07-7.20) versus 7.36 months (95%
      CI: 5.68-10.55) (hazard ratio: 3.57; 95% CI: 1.57-8.11; stratified). Median
      overall survival: 7.95 months for dilpacimab + FOLFIRI; not reached for
      bevacizumab + FOLFIRI. Objective response rates: 5.6% for dilpacimab + FOLFIRI
      and 14.7% for bevacizumab + FOLFIRI. Patients treated with dilpacimab + FOLFIRI
      experienced serious treatment-related adverse events (n = 4; 11.8%), including
      one case of intestinal perforation leading to death; none were reported for
      bevacizumab + FOLFIRI. Conclusion: Treatment with dilpacimab + FOLFIRI was not
      well tolerated and did not provide clinical benefit to patients with mCRC
      compared with bevacizumab + FOLFIRI. Trial Registration Number: NCT03368859
      (Clinicaltrials.gov).

TI  - Rapid screening for genitourinary cancers: mass spectrometry-based metabolic
      fingerprinting of urine.
LID - 10.1039/d2cc02329f [doi]
AB  - Genitourinary (GU) cancers are among the most common malignant diseases in men.
      Rapid screening is the key to GU cancer management for early diagnosis and
      treatment. Urine is a highly accessible specimen type and urine metabolic
      fingerprints (UMFs) reflect underlying metabolite signatures of GU cancers.
      Herein, rapid screening of GU cancers is performed using high-throughput
      extraction of UMFs by mass spectrometry and efficient recognition by machine
      learning (ML). GU cancer patients can be distinguished with an accuracy of 90.1%.
      Besides, key biomarkers such as citric acid were found remarkably upregulated in 
      cancer groups, indicating the dysregulated pathways. This approach highlights the
      potential role of ML in clinical application and demonstrates the expanding
      utility of UMFs in disease screening.

TI  - Abdominopelvic MR to CT registration using a synthetic CT intermediate.
PG  - e13731
LID - 10.1002/acm2.13731 [doi]
AB  - Accurate coregistration of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR)
      imaging can provide clinically relevant and complementary information and can
      serve to facilitate multiple clinical tasks including surgical and radiation
      treatment planning, and generating a virtual Positron Emission Tomography
      (PET)/MR for the sites that do not have a PET/MR system available. Despite the
      long-standing interest in multimodality co-registration, a robust, routine
      clinical solution remains an unmet need. Part of the challenge may be the use of 
      mutual information (MI) maximization and local phase difference (LPD) as
      similarity metrics, which have limited robustness, efficiency, and are difficult 
      to optimize. Accordingly, we propose registering MR to CT by mapping the MR to a 
      synthetic CT intermediate (sCT) and further using it in a sCT-CT deformable image
      registration (DIR) that minimizes the sum of squared differences. The resultant
      deformation field of a sCT-CT DIR is applied to the MRI to register it with the
      CT. Twenty-five sets of abdominopelvic imaging data are used for evaluation. The 
      proposed method is compared to standard MI- and LPD-based methods, and the
      multimodality DIR provided by a state of the art, commercially available
      FDA-cleared clinical software package. The results are compared using global
      similarity metrics, Modified Hausdorff Distance, and Dice Similarity Index on six
      structures. Further, four physicians visually assessed and scored registered
      images for their registration accuracy. As evident from both quantitative and
      qualitative evaluation, the proposed method achieved registration accuracy
      superior to LPD- and MI-based methods and can refine the results of the
      commercial package DIR when using its results as a starting point. Supported by
      these, this manuscript concludes the proposed registration method is more robust,
      accurate, and efficient than the MI- and LPD-based methods.

      uncertainty.
PG  - e13738
LID - 10.1002/acm2.13738 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to propose optimal robust planning by comparing the
      robustness with setup error with the robustness of a conventional planning target
      volume (PTV)-based plan and to compare the robust plan to the PTV-based plan for 
      the target and organ at risk (OAR). Data from 13 patients with
      intermediate-to-high-risk localized prostate cancer who did not have T3b disease 
      were analyzed. The dose distribution under multiple setup error scenarios was
      assessed using a conventional PTV-based plan. The clinical target volume (CTV)
      and OAR dose in moving coordinates were used for the dose constraint with the
      robust plan. The hybrid robust plan added the dose constraint of the PTV-rectum
      to the static coordinate system. When the isocenter was shifted by 10 mm in the
      superior-inferior direction and 8 mm in the right-left and anterior directions,
      the doses to the CTV, bladder, and rectum of the PTV-based plan, robust plan, and
      hybrid robust plan were compared. For the CTV D99% in the PTV-based plan and
      hybrid robust plan, over 95% of the prescribed dose was secured in all
      directions, except in the inferior direction. There was no significant difference
      between the PTV-based plan and the hybrid robust plan for rectum V70Gy , V60Gy , 
      and V40Gy . This study proposed an optimization method for patients with prostate
      cancer. When the setup error occurred within the PTV margin, the dose robustness 
      of the CTV for the hybrid robust plan was higher than that of the PTV-based plan,
      while maintaining the equivalent OAR dose.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the trends in risks of overall and site-specific
      malignancies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Among Japanese 
      patients with RA enrolled in the Institute of Rheumatology, Rheumatoid Arthritis 
      (IORRA) cohort, all malignancies that occurred from 2000 to 2013 were extracted. 
      The standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for
      overall and site-specific malignancies were calculated during three periods:
      pre-biologics, 2000-2004; early biologics, 2005-2009; and recent biologics,
      2010-2013. Risk factors for overall and specific malignancies were analyzed using
      time-dependent Cox regression models. RESULTS: Among 11,299 patients with RA
      (68,483 person-years), 507 malignancies were confirmed. Similar risks were
      observed versus the general Japanese population for overall malignancies
      throughout the three periods, with SIRs (95% CIs) of 0.96 (0.80-1.14) in the
      pre-biologics period, 0.95 (0.82-1.09) in the early biologics period, and 0.87
      (0.75-1.01) in the recent biologics period. Significant increased risk for
      malignant lymphoma was observed throughout the observation period (SIR 4.61, 95% 
      CI 3.58-5.85). The disease activity was a significant risk factor for overall
      malignancies and lung cancer. CONCLUSION: Despite the expanding use of
      methotrexate and biologics, there were no increases in malignancy risk in
      Japanese patients with RA.

AB  - AIMS: This study investigated the effects of beta-caryophyllene (BCP) on
      protecting bone from vitamin D deficiency in mice fed on a diet either lacking
      (D-) or containing (D+) vitamin D. METHODS: A total of 40 female mice were
      assigned to four treatment groups (n = 10/group): D+ diet with propylene glycol
      control, D+ diet with BCP, D-deficient diet with control, and D-deficient diet
      with BCP. The D+ diet is a commercial basal diet, while the D-deficient diet
      contains 0.47% calcium, 0.3% phosphorus, and no vitamin D. All the mice were
      housed in conditions without ultraviolet light. Bone properties were evaluated by
      X-ray micro-CT. Serum levels of klotho were measured by enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Under these conditions, the D-deficient diet
      enhanced the length of femur and tibia bones (p < 0.050), and increased bone
      volume (BV; p < 0.010) and trabecular bone volume fraction (BV/TV; p < 0.010)
      compared to D+ diet. With a diet containing BCP, the mice exhibited higher BV and
      bone mineral density (BMD; p < 0.050) than control group. The trabecular and
      cortical bone were also affected by vitamin D and BCP. In addition, inclusion of 
      dietary BCP improved the serum concentrations of klotho (p < 0.050). In mice,
      klotho regulates the expression level of cannabinoid type 2 receptor (Cnr2) and
      fibroblast growth factor 23 (Fgf23) through CD300a. In humans, data suggest that 
      klotho is connected to BMD. The expression of klotho is also associated with bone
      markers. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that BCP enhances the serum level of
      klotho, leading to improved bone properties and mineralization in an experimental
      mouse model.Cite this article: Bone Joint Res 2022;11(8):528-540.

TI  - Patients' and caregivers' experiences of hospitalization under COVID-19
      visitation restrictions.
LID - 10.1002/jhm.12924 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals did not allow caregiver
      visitation. Little is known about how caregivers' absence affected patients'
      care. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe visitation restrictions' impact on 
      patients and their caregivers experiences. DESIGN: We used a sequential
      explanatory mixed-methods study design. First, we randomly selected 200 adult
      patients with cancer or heart failure hospitalized before (n = 100) and during
      visitor restrictions (n = 100) and abstracted data from the electronic medical
      record on communication between medical teams and caregivers and the topics
      discussed. Results from the quantitative analysis guided our thematic analysis of
      semi-structured interviews conducted with a subsample of patients hospitalized
      during visitor restrictions and their caregivers to understand the impact of
      visitor restrictions on their experiences. RESULTS: Compared to prerestrictions, 
      caregivers under visitation restrictions communicated less frequently with the
      medical team (29% vs. 37% of hospitalized days; p = .04), fewer received
      discharge counseling (37% vs. 52%; p = .04), and disproportionately more had no
      contact with the medical team (36% vs. 17%; p < .01). Video conferencing was
      documented for caregivers of only five patients. Qualitative analysis revealed
      that both caregivers and patients experienced emotional distress, increased
      conflict, and decreased perception of quality of care because of visitation
      restrictions. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital visitor restrictions significantly reduced
      caregivers' communication with patients' medical team, causing caregivers and
      patients emotional distress. Protocols that facilitate communication between
      caregivers and care teams may benefit caregivers who cannot be physically present
      at care facilities, including distance caregivers.

TI  - Lysine-Tethered Stable Bicyclic Cationic Antimicrobial Peptide Combats Bacterial 
      Infection in Vivo.
LID - 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.2c00661 [doi]
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have attracted great attention as next generation
      antibiotics for the treatment of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial infections. 
      Poor proteolytic stability has however undermined clinical applications of AMPs. 
      A novel peptide cyclization approach is described to enhance the in vivo
      antibacterial activity of AMPs. Bicyclic antimicrobial peptides were synthesized 
      by cross-linking the epsilon-amino groups of three lysine residues with a
      1,3,5-trimethylene benzene spacer. In a proof of principal study, four bicyclic
      peptides were synthesized from the cationic AMP OH-CM6. One bicyclic peptide
      retained strong antimicrobial activity and low toxicity but exhibited a prolonged
      half-life in serum. Antibacterial activity was consequently improved in vivo
      without renal or hepato-toxicity. The novel peptide cyclization approach
      represents an important tool for enhancing AMP proteolytic stability for improved
      treatment of bacterial infection.

TI  - Guanylyl cyclase C as a diagnostic and therapeutic target in colorectal cancer.
LID - 10.2217/pme-2022-0026 [doi]
AB  - Colorectal cancer remains a major cause of mortality in the USA, despite advances
      in prevention and screening. Existing therapies focus primarily on generic
      treatment such as surgical intervention and chemotherapy, depending on disease
      severity. As personalized medicine and targeted molecular oncology continue to
      develop as promising treatment avenues, there has emerged a need for effective
      targets and biomarkers of colorectal cancer. The transmembrane receptor guanylyl 
      cyclase C (GUCY2C) regulates intestinal homeostasis and has emerged as a tumor
      suppressor. Further, it is universally expressed in advanced metastatic
      colorectal tumors, as well as other cancer types that arise through intestinal
      metaplasia. In this context, GUCY2C satisfies many characteristics of a
      compelling target and biomarker for gastrointestinal malignancies.

OAB - Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of death in the USA. In recent years, there 
      has been a shift in the field of oncology from generic treatments, such as
      surgery and chemotherapy, to personalized molecular therapies, which focus on
      targeting specific attributes of each patient's unique cancer. Guanylyl cyclase C
      is a receptor expressed in the intestinal tract, where it regulates fluid
      secretion and prevents tumor formation. Beyond its function in the healthy
      intestine, it is expressed in colorectal tumors, and other types of cancer, where
      it regulates transformation. Therefore, guanylyl cyclase C can serve as a useful 
      target in cancer for prevention and therapy, as well as a marker for tumor cell
      detection.

TI  - Transcriptional regulation of glucose transporters in human oral squamous cell
      carcinoma cells.
LID - 10.1111/jop.13342 [doi]
AB  - The increased glucose uptake observed in cancer cells is mediated by glucose
      transporters (GLUTs), a class of trans-membrane proteins that facilitate the
      transport of glucose and other substrates across the plasma membrane. Despite an 
      important role of glucose in the pathophysiology of oral squamous cell carcinoma 
      (OSCC), there is very limited data regarding the expression of GLUTs in normal or
      malignant cells from the oral mucosa. We analysed the mRNA expression of all 14
      GLUTs in two OSCC (H357/H400) and one non-malignant oral keratinocyte (OKF6) cell
      lines using qPCR. GLUT expression was evaluated at baseline and after treatment
      with two specific GLUT inhibitors, namely BAY876 (GLUT1) and WZB117 (GLUT1,3 and 
      4). Here we show that GLUT1,3,4,5,6,8,12, and 13 transcripts were measurably
      expressed in all cell lines while GLUT2,7,9,11, and 14 were not expressed. GLUT10
      was only found in H357. In the presence of BAY876 and WZB117, OSCC cells
      exhibited significant alterations in the transcriptional profile of GLUTs. In
      particular, we observed distinct proliferation-dependent changes of mRNAs to
      GLUT1,3,4,5, and 6 in response to selective GLUT inhibitors. In summary, we
      documented for the first time the expression of GLUT5,6, and 12 in normal and
      malignant oral keratinocytes. Whilst regulation of GLUT transcripts was cell line
      and inhibitor specific, GLUT3 was consistently upregulated in actively
      proliferating OSCC cell lines, but not in OKF6, regardless of the inhibitor used,
      suggesting that modulation of this transporter may act as one of the primary
      compensation mechanisms for OSCC cells upon inhibition of glucose uptake.

TI  - Impedimetric Detection of Calreticulin by a Disposable Immunosensor Modified with
      a Single-Walled Carbon Nanotube-Conducting Polymer Nanocomposite.
LID - 10.1021/acsbiomaterials.2c00499 [doi]
AB  - A label-free impedimetric immunosensing system was constructed for ultrasensitive
      determination of the calreticulin (CALR) biological marker in human serum samples
      utilizing an electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis technique for the
      first time. The new biosensor fabrication procedure consisted of
      electrodeposition of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) incorporating
      polymerization of an oxiran-2-yl methyl 3-(1H-pyrrol-1-yl) propanoate monomer
      (Pepx) onto a low-cost and disposable indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode. The
      SWCNTs-PPepx nanocomposite layer was prepared onto the ITO after the one-step
      fabrication procedure. The fabrication procedure of the immunosensor and the
      characteristic biomolecular interactions between the anti-CALR and CALR were
      characterized by electrochemical analysis and morphological monitoring
      techniques. Under optimum conditions, the proposed biosensor was responsive to
      CALR concentrations over the detection ranges of 0.015-60 pg/mL linearly, and it 
      had a very low detection limit (4.6 fg/mL) and a favorable sensitivity (0.43
      kOmega pg(-1) mL cm(-2)). The reliability of the biosensor system in clinical
      analysis was investigated by successful quantification of CALR levels in human
      serum. Moreover, the repeatability and reproducibility results of the biosensor
      were evaluated by using Dixon, Grubbs, T-test, and F-tests. Consequently, the
      proposed biosensor was a promising method for scientific, rapid, and successful
      analysis of CALR in human serum samples.

TI  - Diagnostic Yield of Cone-beam-Derived Augmented Fluoroscopy and Ultrathin
      Bronchoscopy Versus Conventional Navigational Bronchoscopy Techniques.
LID - 10.1097/LBR.0000000000000883 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pulmonary nodules suspicious for lung cancer are frequently
      diagnosed. Evaluating and optimizing the diagnostic yield of lung nodule biopsy
      is critical as innovation in bronchoscopy continues to progress. METHODS: This is
      a retrospective cohort study. Consecutive patients undergoing guided bronchoscopy
      for suspicious pulmonary nodule(s) between February 2020 and July 2021 were
      included. The cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT)+ radial endobronchial
      ultrasound (r-EBUS) group had their procedure using CBCT-derived augmented
      fluoroscopy along with r-EBUS. The CBCT+ ultrathin bronchoscope (UTB)+r-EBUS
      group had the same procedure but with the use of an ultrathin bronchoscope. The
      r-EBUS group underwent r-EBUS guidance without CBCT or augmented fluoroscopy. We 
      used multivariable logistic regression to compare diagnostic yield, adjusting for
      confounding variables. RESULTS: A total of 116 patients were included. The median
      pulmonary lesion diameter was 19.5 mm (interquartile range, 15.0 to 27.5 mm), and
      91 (78.4%) were in the peripheral half of the lung. Thirty patients (25.9%)
      underwent CBCT+UTB, 27 (23.3%) CBCT, and 59 (50.9%) r-EBUS alone with unadjusted 
      diagnostic yields of 86.7%, 70.4%, and 42.4%, respectively (P<0.001). The
      adjusted diagnostic yields were 85.0% (95% CI, 68.6% to 100%), 68.3% (95% CI,
      50.1% to 86.6%), and 44.5% (95% CI, 31.0% to 58.0%), respectively. There was
      significantly more virtual navigational bronchoscopy use in the r-EBUS group
      (45.8%) compared with the CBCT+UTB (13.3%) and CBCT (18.5%) groups, respectively.
      CBCT procedures required dose area product radiation doses of 7602.5 microGym2.
      CONCLUSION: Compared with the r-EBUS group, CBCT + UTB + r-EBUS was associated
      with higher navigational success, fewer nondiagnostic biopsy results, and a
      higher diagnostic yield. CBCT procedures are associated with a considerable
      radiation dose.

TI  - Two novel CreER(T2) transgenic mouse lines to study melanocytic cells in vivo.
LID - 10.1111/pcmr.13061 [doi]
AB  - The skin of adult mammals protects from radiation, physical and chemical insults.
      While melanocytes and melanocyte-producing stem cells contribute to proper skin
      function in healthy organisms, dysfunction of these cells can lead to the
      generation of malignant melanoma - the deadliest type of skin cancer. Addressing 
      cells of the melanocyte lineage in vivo represents a prerequisite for the
      understanding of melanoma on cellular level and the development of preventive and
      treatment strategies. Here, the inducible Cre-loxP-system has emerged as a
      promising tool to specifically target, monitor and modulate cells in adult mice. 
      Re-analysis of existing sequencing data sets of melanocytic cells revealed that
      genes with a known function in neural cells, including neural stem cells (Aldh1L1
      and Nestin), are also expressed in melanocytic cells. Therefore, in this study we
      explored whether the promoter activity of Nestin and Aldh1L1 can serve to target 
      cells of the melanocyte lineage using the inducible CreER(T2) -loxP-system. Using
      an immunohistochemical approach and different time-points of analysis, we were
      able to map the melanocytic fate of recombined stem cells in the adult hair
      follicle of Nestin-CreER(T2) and Aldh1L1-CreER(T2) transgenic mice. Thus, we here
      present two new mouse models and propose their use to study and putatively
      modulate adult melanocytic cells in vivo.

TI  - Competing risk analysis of cardiovascular death in patients with primary
      gallbladder cancer.
LID - 10.1002/cam4.5104 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Developments in medical technology are resulting in continuous
      decreases in the cancer mortality rate of patients with gallbladder cancer, while
      non-cancer deaths in cancer patients are becoming more common. The main cause of 
      this is cardiovascular mortality (CVM). The purpose of this study was to
      determine the CVM risk in patients with primary gallbladder cancer (PGC).
      METHODS: We extracted information on patients in the SEER database who were
      diagnosed with PGC from 2004 to 2015, compared CVM in patients with PGC with the 
      general United States population, and calculated standardized mortality rates
      (SMRs) and the absolute excess risk. A competing risks model was used to identify
      and analyze the independent risk factors for cardiovascular death in patients
      with PGC. RESULTS: This study included 5925 patients, 247 of whom died from
      cardiovascular disease. The SMR of cardiovascular death in patients with PGC was 
      15.84 (95% confidence interval: 15.83-15.85), and the SMR was slightly lower in
      male than female patients. The competing risks analysis indicated that age,
      marital status, cancer cell differentiation, chemotherapy status, and year of
      diagnosis were risk factors for cardiovascular death in patients with PGC.
      CONCLUSIONS: The CVM risk is considerably higher in patients with PGC than in the
      general population. It is therefore very necessary to apply cardioprotective
      interventions to patients with PGC.

TI  - Elp3-mediated codon-dependent translation promotes mTORC2 activation and
      regulates macrophage polarization.

AB  - Macrophage polarization is a process whereby macrophages acquire distinct
      effector states (M1 or M2) to carry out multiple and sometimes opposite
      functions. We show here that translational reprogramming occurs during macrophage
      polarization and that this relies on the Elongator complex subunit Elp3, an
      enzyme that modifies the wobble uridine base U34 in cytosolic tRNAs. Elp3
      expression is downregulated by classical M1-activating signals in myeloid cells, 
      where it limits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines via FoxO1
      phosphorylation, and attenuates experimental colitis in mice. In contrast,
      alternative M2-activating signals upregulate Elp3 expression through a PI3K- and 
      STAT6-dependent signaling pathway. The metabolic reprogramming linked to M2
      macrophage polarization relies on Elp3 and the translation of multiple
      candidates, including the mitochondrial ribosome large subunit proteins Mrpl3,
      Mrpl13, and Mrpl47. By promoting translation of its activator Ric8b in a
      codon-dependent manner, Elp3 also regulates mTORC2 activation. Elp3 expression in
      myeloid cells further promotes Wnt-driven tumor initiation in the intestine by
      maintaining a pool of tumor-associated macrophages exhibiting M2 features.
      Collectively, our data establish a functional link between tRNA modifications,
      mTORC2 activation, and macrophage polarization.

AB  - Endocrine Treatments in Breast Cancer Abstract. Breast cancer, the most common
      cancer in women, expresses estrogen and/or progesterone receptors in about 75% of
      patients. This allows for the use of endocrine treatments. Adjuvant therapy with 
      tamoxifen for 5 years reduces the mortality by about 33%; the residual risk can
      be lowered by using aromatase inhibitors and by prolonging the treatment. In
      patients with advanced disease, the median duration of response to first-line
      therapy is about twelve months, and the median survival time is 20 to 40 months. 
      The use of the various substances differs in terms of duration, sequence, and
      combinations, particularly with CDK4/6-inhibitors, depending on the clinical
      situation. Endocrine therapies are prescribed over a long period of time.
      Treatment adherence is improved by optimal control of side effects.

      pediatric osteosarcomas using ALT.
PG  - e15859
LID - 10.15252/emmm.202215859 [doi]
AB  - In some types of cancer, telomere length is maintained by the alternative
      lengthening of telomeres (ALT) mechanism. In many ALT cancers, the
      alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX) gene is mutated
      leading to the conclusion that the ATRX complex represses ALT. Here, we report
      that most high-grade pediatric osteosarcomas maintain their telomeres by ALT, and
      that the majority of these ALT tumors are ATRX wild-type (wt) and instead carry
      an amplified 17p11.2 chromosomal region containing TOP3A. We found that TOP3A was
      overexpressed in the ALT-positive ATRX-wt tumors consistent with its
      amplification. We demonstrated the functional significance of these results by
      showing that TOP3A overexpression in ALT cancer cells countered ATRX-mediated ALT
      inhibition and that TOP3A knockdown disrupted the ALT phenotype in ATRX-wt cells.
      Moreover, we report that TOP3A is required for proper BLM localization and
      promotes ALT DNA synthesis in ALT cell lines. Collectively, our results identify 
      TOP3A as a major ALT player and potential therapeutic target.

AB  - Despite the crucial role of phenotypic and genetic intratumoral heterogeneity in 
      understanding and predicting clinical outcomes for patients with cancer,
      computational pathology studies have yet to make substantial steps in this area. 
      The major limiting factor has been the bulk gene-sequencing practice that results
      in loss of spatial information of gene status, making the study of intratumoral
      heterogeneity difficult. In this issue of Cancer Research, Acosta and colleagues 
      used deep learning to study if localized gene mutation status can be predicted
      from localized tumor morphology for clear cell renal cell carcinoma. The
      algorithm was developed using curated sets of matched hematoxylin and eosin and
      IHC images, which represent spatially resolved morphology and genotype,
      respectively. This study confirms the existence of a strong link between
      morphology and underlying genetics on a regional level, paving the way for
      further investigations into intratumoral heterogeneity. See related article by
      Acosta et al., p. 2792.

TI  - Orthovoltage X-Rays Exhibit Increased Efficacy Compared with gamma-Rays in
      Preclinical Irradiation.
PG  - 2678-2691
LID - 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-22-0656 [doi]
AB  - Radionuclide irradiators (137Cs and 60Co) are commonly used in preclinical
      studies ranging from cancer therapy to stem cell biology. Amidst concerns of
      radiological terrorism, there are institutional initiatives to replace
      radionuclide sources with lower energy X-ray sources. As researchers transition, 
      questions remain regarding whether the biological effects of gamma-rays may be
      recapitulated with orthovoltage X-rays because different energies may induce
      divergent biological effects. We therefore sought to compare the effects of
      orthovoltage X-rays with 1-mm Cu or Thoraeus filtration and 137Cs gamma-rays
      using mouse models of acute radiation syndrome. Following whole-body irradiation,
      30-day overall survival was assessed, and the lethal dose to provoke 50%
      mortality within 30-days (LD50) was calculated by logistic regression. LD50 doses
      were 6.7 Gy, 7.4 Gy, and 8.1 Gy with 1-mm Cu-filtered X-rays, Thoraeus-filtered
      X-rays, and 137Cs gamma-rays, respectively. Comparison of bone marrow, spleen,
      and intestinal tissue from mice irradiated with equivalent doses indicated that
      injury was most severe with 1-mm Cu-filtered X-rays, which resulted in the
      greatest reduction in bone marrow cellularity, hematopoietic stem and progenitor 
      populations, intestinal crypts, and OLFM4+ intestinal stem cells.
      Thoraeus-filtered X-rays provoked an intermediate phenotype, with 137Cs showing
      the least damage. This study reveals a dichotomy between physical dose and
      biological effect as researchers transition to orthovoltage X-rays. With
      decreasing energy, there is increasing hematopoietic and intestinal injury,
      necessitating dose reduction to achieve comparable biological effects.
      SIGNIFICANCE: Understanding the significance of physical dose delivered using
      energetically different methods of radiation treatment will aid the transition
      from radionuclide gamma-irradiators to orthovoltage X-irradiators.

PG  - 2674-2677
LID - 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-21-2978 [doi]
AB  - In recent years, there has been a growing recognition that P values, albeit
      useful in reporting data analysis results, have often been misused or
      misinterpreted in biomedical research. The emergence of big health data such as
      genomics data and electronic health records, sometimes combined with inadequate
      experimental design, has exacerbated this problem, which has become a major cause
      of the ongoing crisis in reproducibility in biomedical research. We aim to shed
      light and raise awareness of common misuses and pitfalls of P values and discuss 
      potential mitigation strategies that leverage state-of-the-art statistical
      methods. The best practices always start with a sound study design including a
      robust data collection strategy to minimize data bias and a carefully thought-out
      analysis plan that can address potential misuses and pitfalls of P values. We
      highly encourage biomedical researchers to engage and involve statisticians from 
      the very beginning of their studies.

TI  - Liquid biopsies for early diagnosis of brain tumours: in silico mathematical
      biomarker modelling.
PG  - 20220180
LID - 10.1098/rsif.2022.0180 [doi]
AB  - Brain tumours are the biggest cancer killer in those under 40 and reduce life
      expectancy more than any other cancer. Blood-based liquid biopsies may aid early 
      diagnosis, prediction and prognosis for brain tumours. It remains unclear whether
      known blood-based biomarkers, such as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP),
      have the required sensitivity and selectivity. We have developed a novel in
      silico model which can be used to assess and compare blood-based liquid biopsies.
      We focused on GFAP, a putative biomarker for astrocytic tumours and glioblastoma 
      multi-formes (GBMs). In silico modelling was paired with experimental measurement
      of cell GFAP concentrations and used to predict the tumour volumes and identify
      key parameters which limit detection. The average GBM volumes of 449 patients at 
      Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust were also measured and used as a benchmark.
      Our model predicts that the currently proposed GFAP threshold of 0.12 ng ml(-1)
      may not be suitable for early detection of GBMs, but that lower thresholds may be
      used. We found that the levels of GFAP in the blood are related to tumour
      characteristics, such as vasculature damage and rate of necrosis, which are
      biological markers of tumour aggressiveness. We also demonstrate how these models
      could be used to provide clinical insight.

TI  - The reporting quality of N-of-1 trials and protocols still needs improvement.
LID - 10.1111/jebm.12484 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the reporting quality of single-patient (N-of-1) trials
      and protocols based on the CONSORT Extension for N-of-1 trials (CENT) statement
      and the standard protocol items: recommendations for interventional trials
      (SPIRIT) extension and elaboration for N-of-1 trials (SPENT) checklist to examine
      the factors that influenced reporting quality. METHODS: Four electronic databases
      were searched to identify N-of-1 trials and protocols from 2015 to 2020. Quality 
      was assessed by two reviewers. We calculated the overall scores based on binary
      responses in which "Yes" was scored as 1 (if the item was fully reported), and
      "No" was scored as 0 (if the item was not clearly reported or not definitely
      stated). RESULTS: A total of 78 publications (55 N-of-1 trials and 23 protocols) 
      were identified. The mean reporting score (SD) of the N-of-1 trials and protocols
      were 29.24 (0.89) and 29.61 (1.83), respectively. For the items related to
      outcomes, sample size, allocation concealment protocol, and informed consent
      materials, the reporting quality was low. Our results showed that the year of
      publication (t = -0.793, p = 0.872 for the trials and t = 1.352, p = 0.623 for
      the protocols) and the impact factor of the journal (t = 1.416, p = 0.619 for the
      trials and t = 0.359, p = 0.667 for the protocols) were not factors associated
      with better reporting quality. CONCLUSION: With the publication of the CENT 2015 
      statement and the SPENT 2019 checklist, authors should adhere to the relevant
      reporting guidelines and improve the reporting quality of N-of-1 trials and
      protocols.

LID - 10.1039/c3sc53426j [doi]
AB  - Multi-elemental, isotope selective nano-scale secondary ion mass spectrometry
      (NanoSIMS) combined with confocal laser-scanning microscopy was used to
      characterize the subcellular distribution of (15)N-labeled cisplatin in human
      colon cancer cells. These analyses indicated predominant cisplatin colocalisation
      with sulfur-rich structures in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Furthermore,
      colocalisation of platinum with phosphorus-rich chromatin regions was observed,
      which is consistent with its binding affinity to DNA as the generally accepted
      crucial target of the drug. Application of (15)N-labeled cisplatin and subsequent
      measurement of the nitrogen isotopic composition and determination of the
      relative intensities of platinum and nitrogen associated secondary ion signals in
      different cellular compartments with NanoSIMS suggested partial dissociation of
      Pt-N bonds during the accumulation process, in particular within nucleoli at
      elevated cisplatin concentrations. This finding raises the question as to whether
      the observed intracellular dissociation of the drug has implications for the
      mechanism of action of cisplatin. Within the cytoplasm, platinum mainly
      accumulated in acidic organelles, as demonstrated by a direct combination of
      specific fluorescent staining, confocal laser scanning microscopy and NanoSIMS.
      Different processing of platinum drugs in acidic organelles might be relevant for
      their detoxification, as well as for their mode of action.

TI  - Recurrent thrombosis rescued by fondaparinux in high-risk patients: A case
      series.
PG  - e12773
LID - 10.1002/rth2.12773 [doi]
AB  - Background: Recurrent thrombosis treatment options are limited when
      anticoagulation with dose escalation of low molecular weight heparin or
      unfractionated heparin fail. Fondaparinux is a pure, synthetic pentasaccharide
      that consists of heparin's essential five-sugar chain that binds antithrombin to 
      inactivate factor Xa. There is scarce data regarding fondaparinux's use in
      recurrent thrombosis. Key Clinical Question: We aim to explore fondaparinux's
      role in recurrent thrombosis when other standard anticoagulation treatments fail.
      Clinical Approach: We report a case series of six high thrombotic risk patients
      successfully treated with fondaparinux after thrombosis progression while on
      supratherapeutic low molecular weight heparin or unfractionated heparin. Of our
      six patients, two were previously diagnosed with a high-risk thrombophilia:
      triple positive antiphospholipid syndrome, and homozygous factor V Leiden. The
      other four had an underlying malignancy. Conclusion: With fondaparinux, no
      thrombosis progression was observed, and no bleeding complications occurred.

PG  - e2021388
LID - 10.4322/acr.2021.388 [doi]
AB  - The clear cell variant of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) is an uncommon
      histological variant. Kuo first discovered it in the skin, and Frazier et al.
      found it in the oral cavity. We know of only nine cases of clear cell variant of 
      OSCC reported in the literature till now. The present case is in a 60-year-old
      male patient with an ulcer on the left posterolateral border of the tongue. The
      patient had a history of chewing tobacco for 22 years. Clinical examination
      showed features of malignant ulcer associated with pain and discomfort.
      Histopathological examination revealed sheets and islands of atypical epithelial 
      cells with clear cytoplasm, nuclear and cellular pleomorphism, and few keratin
      pearls in the connective tissue suggesting OSCC. Various special stains were
      performed to identify clear cells. Periodic Acid Schiff-Diastase (PAS-D) and
      Mucicarmine stains showed positive and negative reactions in clear cells,
      respectively. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis for cytokeratin (AE1/AE3) showed
      diffuse positivity in clear cells and other epithelial cells. Based on special
      stains and IHC markers, we confirmed the diagnosis as a clear cell variant of
      OSCC. This variant is rare and presents diagnostic challenges. It is said to be
      aggressive in nature. More such cases should be reported to understand its
      biological behavior and prognosis.

AB  - Background: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most
      common cancer worldwide and the human papillomavirus (HPV(+))-driven subtype is
      the fastest rising cancer in North America. Although most cases of HPV(+) HNSCC
      respond favorably to the treatment via surgery followed by radiochemotherapy, up 
      to 20% recur with a poor prognosis. The molecular and cellular mechanisms of
      recurrence are not fully understood. Methods: To gain insights into the
      mechanisms of recurrence and to inform patient stratification and personalized
      treatment, we compared the proteome and phosphoproteome of recurrent and
      non-recurrent tumors by quantitative mass spectrometry. Results: We observe
      significant differences between the recurrent and non-recurrent tumors in
      cellular composition, function, and signaling. The recurrent tumors are
      characterized by a pro-fibrotic and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment
      (TME) featuring markedly more abundant cancer-associated fibroblasts,
      extracellular matrix (ECM), neutrophils, and suppressive myeloid cells. Defective
      T cell function and increased epithelial-mesenchymal transition potential are
      also associated with recurrence. These cellular changes in the TME are
      accompanied by reprogramming of the kinome and the signaling networks that
      regulate the ECM, cytoskeletal reorganization, cell adhesion, neutrophil
      function, and coagulation. Conclusions: In addition to providing systems-level
      insights into the molecular basis of recurrence, our work identifies numerous
      mechanism-based, candidate biomarkers and therapeutic targets that may aid future
      endeavors to develop prognostic biomarkers and precision-targeted treatment for
      recurrent HPV(+) HNSCC.

TI  - Machine Learning-based Correlation Study between Perioperative Immunonutritional 
      Index and Postoperative Anastomotic Leakage in Patients with Gastric Cancer.
PG  - 1173-1183
LID - 10.7150/ijms.72195 [doi]
AB  - Backgrounds: The immunonutritional index showed great potential for predicting
      postoperative complications in various malignant diseases, while risk assessment 
      based on machine learning (ML) methods is becoming popular in clinical practice. 
      Early detection and prevention for postoperative anastomotic leakage (AL) play an
      important role in prognosis improvement among patients with gastric cancer (GC). 
      Methods: This retrospective study included 297 patients with gastric cancer
      receiving gastrectomy between 2018 and 2021 in general surgery department of
      Xinhua Hospital. Perioperative clinical variables were collected to evaluate the 
      predictive value for postoperative AL with 5 ML models. Then, AUROC was applied
      to identify the optimal perioperative clinical index and ML model for predicting 
      postoperative AL. Results: The incidence of postoperative AL was 6.1% (n=18).
      After the training of 5 ML classification models, we found that immunonutritional
      index had significantly better classification ability than inflammatory or
      nutritional index alone separately (AUROC=0.87 vs. 0.83, P=0.01; AUROC=0.87 vs.
      0.68, P<0.01). Next, we found that support vector machine (SVM), one of the ML
      methods, with selected immunonutritional index showed significantly greater
      classification ability than optimal univariant parameter [CRP on postoperative
      day 4 (AUROC=0.89 vs.0.86, P=0.02)]. Also, statistical analysis revealed multiple
      variables with significant relevance to postoperative AL, including serum CRP and
      albumin on postoperative day 4, NLR and SII etc. Conclusion: This study showed
      that perioperative immunonutritional index could act as an indicator for
      postoperative AL. Also, ML methods could significantly enhance the classification
      ability, and therefore, could be applied as a powerful tool for postoperative
      risk assessment for patients with GC.

      cells.
PG  - 1138-1146
LID - 10.7150/ijms.72646 [doi]
AB  - Indoxyl sulfate (IS) and p-cresyl sulfate (PCS), protein-bound uremic toxins, can
      induce oxidative stress and cause renal disease progression. However, the
      different cytotoxic effects on renal cells between IS and PCS are not stated. Due
      to uremic toxins are generally found in CKD patients, the mechanisms of uremic
      toxins-induced renal injury are required to study. Curcumin has anti-oxidant,
      anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects which may be potential used to
      protect against renal damage. In contrast, curcumin also exert cytotoxic effects 
      on various cells. In addition, curcumin may reduce or enhance cytotoxicity
      combined with different chemicals treatments. However, whether curcumin may
      influence uremic toxins-induced renal injury is unclear. The goal of this study
      is to compare the different cytotoxic effects on renal cells between IS and PCS
      treatment, as well as the synergistic or antagonistic effects by combination
      treatments with curcumin and PCS. Our experimental result shows the PCS exerts a 
      stronger antiproliferative effect on renal tubular cells than IS treatment. In
      addition, our study firstly demonstrates that curcumin enhances PCS-induced cell 
      cytotoxicity through caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway and cell cycle
      alteration.

AB  - The anti-cancer effects of [6]-gingerol ([6]-GIN), the main active polyphenol of 
      ginger (Zingiber officinale), were investigated in the human bladder cancer cell 
      line 5637. [6]-GIN inhibited cell proliferation, increased subG1 phase ratios,
      and depolarized mitochondrial membrane potential. [6]-GIN-induced cell death was 
      associated with the downregulation of Bcell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) and survivin and
      the upregulation of Bcl2associated X protein (Bax). [6]-GIN activated caspase3
      and caspase-9 and regulated the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases
      (MAPKs). Further, [6]-GIN also increased the intracellular reactive oxygen
      species (ROS) levels and TG100-115 or tranilast increased [6]-GINinduced cell
      death. These results suggest that [6]-GIN induced apoptosis in the bladder cancer
      cell line 5637 and therefore has the potential to be used in the development of
      new drugs for bladder cancer treatment.

AB  - Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is particularly prevalent in Taiwan. The goal
      of this study was to determine the clinicopathological role of insulin-like
      growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2) proteins as an indicator of
      clinical outcomes in OSCC patients. In this study, immunohistochemical (IHC)
      analysis was used to examine IGF2BP2 protein expression in 244 OSCC patients. We 
      investigated the relationships among IGF2BP2 expression, clinicopathological
      variables, and patient survival. Our results showed that IGF2BP2 cytoplasmic
      protein expression was significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis,
      cancer stage, and patient survival. Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed that
      elevated cytoplasmic IGF2BP2 expression levels in OSCC patients were associated
      with poor overall survival. Moreover, multivariate cox proportional hazard models
      revealed that cytoplasmic IGF2BP2 expression, T status, and lymph node metastasis
      were independent prognostic factors for survival. In conclusion, IGF2BP2 protein 
      was found to be a helpful predictive marker for OSCC patients, as well as a
      possible therapeutic target for OSCC treatment.

PG  - 1103-1109
LID - 10.7150/ijms.73417 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to investigate the influence of androgen deprivation therapy
      (ADT) for the development of dry eye disease (DED) in subjects with prostate
      cancer via the use of national health insurance research database (NHIRD) of
      Taiwan. A retrospective cohort study was conducted and patients were selected as 
      prostate cancer with ADT according to diagnostic and procedure codes. Each
      participant in that group was then matched to one patient with prostate cancer
      but without ADT and two subject s without prostate cancer and ADT. And a total of
      1791, 1791 and 3582 participants were enrolled in each group. The primary outcome
      was set as the DED development according to the diagnostic codes. Cox
      proportional hazard regression was applied to calculate the adjusted hazard ratio
      (aHR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of ADT and other parameters for DED
      development. There were 228, 126 and 95 new events of DED developed in the
      control group, the prostate cancer without ADT group and the prostate cancer with
      ADT group. The rate of DED in the prostate cancer with ADT group (aHR: 0.980, 95%
      CI: 0.771-1.246, P= 0.8696) and Prostate cancer without ADT group (aHR: 1.064,
      95% CI: 0.855-1.325, P= 0.5766) were not significantly different compared to the 
      control group. In addition, the patients aged 70-79 years old demonstrated a
      significantly higher incidence of developing DED compared to those aged 50-59
      years old (aHR: 1.885, 95% CI: 1.188-2.989, P= 0.0071). In conclusion, the use of
      ADT did not alter the incidence of subsequent DED.

TI  - Incidence of oxaliplatin hypersensitivity reaction among colorectal cancer
      patients: A 5-year retrospective study.
PG  - 2635
LID - 10.18549/PharmPract.2022.2.2635 [doi]
AB  - Background: Oxaliplatin is a third-generation platinum compound that has efficacy
      against colorectal cancer. Hypersensitivity reactions during oxaliplatin infusion
      are a key problem during its use, with the varying incidences and deficiencies of
      clearly identified risk factors. Objective: To determine the incidence, severity 
      and risk factors of oxaliplatin-related hypersensitivity reaction (HSR). Method: 
      This retrospective study investigated 245 colorectal cancer patients (1,690
      treatment cycles) receiving care at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Thai
      Red Cross society between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2019. The patients'
      demographic data, laboratory data and clinical features suggesting
      hypersensitivity reactions to oxaliplatin were reviewed. The Fisher's Exact test 
      and unpaired t-test were used to determine the differences among patients with
      and without oxaliplatin HSR. The potential risk factors for oxaliplatin HSR were 
      analyzed for statistical significance by logistic regression. Results: A total of
      245 colorectal cancer patients (1,690 treatment cycles) were included in this
      study. The incidence of oxaliplatin HSR was 37.96%, according to the US National 
      Cancer Institute (NCI)-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NTCAE)
      version 5.0, grade 1, grade 2 and higher grades were 27.35% (67 patients), 6.53% 
      (16 patients) and 4.08% (10 patients), respectively. The proportion of male
      patients and patients with a history of prior exposure to platinum-based
      chemotherapy were statistically higher in the HSR group. The eosinophil count and
      serum creatinine level were also significantly greater in the HSR group. On the
      contrary, the total lymphocyte count and serum albumin level were significantly
      lower in the HSR group. The multivariate logistic regression found 5 risk factors
      with a significant difference. Male gender, prior exposure to platinum-based
      chemotherapy and elevated eosinophil count were associated with increased risk of
      oxaliplatin HSR, whereas elevated monocyte count and elevated serum albumin were 
      protective factors for the development of oxaliplatin HSR. Conclusion: Colorectal
      cancer patients treated with an oxaliplatin-based regimen with male gender, prior
      exposure to platinum-based chemotherapy and elevated eosinophil count have a
      greater risk of oxaliplatin related hypersensitivity reactions.

AB  - Tumour thrombus is the presence of tumour cells in great vessels. The reported
      incidence of tumour thrombus in thyroid carcinoma is about 0.2-3.8%. Being
      asymptomatic, detection of tumour thrombosis clinically is difficult. We present 
      the report of internal jugular vein (IJV) tumour thrombosis in a known follicular
      thyroid carcinoma patient, detected with multimodality imaging. Grayscale
      ultrasound scan of the neck showed a well-defined, bi-lobed (2.4 x 1.5) cm,
      intraluminal solid lesion with homogeneous echotexture within the distal left IJV
      close to its confluence with the ipsilateral subclavian vein. The lesion showed
      significant internal vascularity on colour Doppler assessment. The sonographic
      findings confirmed further imaging with computed tomography (CT) and radioisotope
      scans. We conclude that patients with thyroid cancer should be evaluated for
      tumour thrombosis both clinically and with imaging, particularly with ultrasound 
      and CT/MRI or nuclear medicine, as it has prognostic implications. Funding: None

TI  - alpha2-3 Sialic acid binding and uptake by human monocyte-derived dendritic cells
      alters metabolism and cytokine release and initiates tolerizing T cell
      programming.
PG  - ltab012
LID - 10.1093/immadv/ltab012 [doi]
AB  - Dendritic cells (DCs) are key in the initiation of the adaptive T cell responses 
      to tailor adequate immunity that corresponds to the type of pathogen encountered.
      Oppositely, DCs control the resolution phase of inflammation and are able to
      induce tolerance after receiving anti-inflammatory cytokines or upon encounter of
      self-associated molecular patterns, such as alpha2-3 linked sialic acid
      (alpha2-3sia). OBJECTIVE: We here investigated whether alpha2-3sia, that bind
      immune inhibitory Siglec receptors, would alter signaling and reprogramming of
      LPS-stimulated human monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs). METHODS AND RESULTS:
      Transcriptomic analysis of moDCs stimulated with alpha2-3sia-conjugated
      dendrimers revealed differentially expressed genes related to metabolic pathways,
      cytokines, and T cell differentiation. An increase in genes involved in ATPase
      regulator activity, oxidoreductase activity, and glycogen metabolic processes was
      detected. Metabolic extracellular flux analysis confirmed a more energetic moDC
      phenotype upon alpha2-3sia binding as evidenced by an increase in both glycolysis
      and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. TH1 differentiation promoting genes 
      IFNL and IL27, were significantly downregulated in the presence of alpha2-3sia.
      Functional assays confirmed that alpha2-3sia binding to moDCs induced
      phosphorylation of Siglec-9, reduced production of inflammatory cytokines IL-12
      and IL-6, and increased IL-10. Surprisingly, alpha2-3sia-differentiated moDCs
      promoted FoxP3(+)CD25(+/-)CD127(-) regulatory T cell differentiation and
      decreased FoxP3(-)CD25(-)CD127(-) effector T cell proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      conclusion, we demonstrate that alpha2-3sia binding to moDCs, phosphorylates
      Siglec-9, alters metabolic pathways, cytokine signaling, and T cell
      differentiation processes in moDCs and promotes regulatory T cells. The sialic
      acid-Siglec axis on DCs is therefore, a novel target to induce tolerance and to
      explore for immunotherapeutic interventions aimed to restore inflammatory
      processes.

TI  - Behind the scenes with basophils: an emerging therapeutic target.
PG  - ltab008
LID - 10.1093/immadv/ltab008 [doi]
AB  - Though basophils were originally viewed as redundant blood 'mast cells', the
      implementation of flow cytometry has established basophils as unique leukocytes
      with critical immunomodulatory functions. Basophils play an active role in
      allergic inflammation, autoimmunity, and hematological malignancies. They are
      distinguishable from other leukocytes by their characteristic metachromatic
      deep-purple cytoplasmic, round granules. Mature basophils are phenotypically
      characterized by surface expression of IL-3Ralpha (CD123); IL-3 drives basophil
      differentiation, degranulation, and synthesis of inflammatory mediators including
      type 2 cytokines. Basophil degranulation is the predominant source of histamine
      in peripheral blood, promoting allergic responses. Basophils serve as a bridge
      between innate and adaptive immunity by secreting IL-4 which supports eosinophil 
      migration, monocyte differentiation into macrophages, B-cell activation, and CD4 
      T-cell differentiation into Th2 cells. Further, basophilia is a key phenomenon in
      myeloid neoplasms, especially chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) for which it is a
      diagnostic criterion. Increased circulating basophils, often with aberrant
      immunophenotype, have been detected in patients with CML and other
      myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). The significance of basophils'
      immunoregulatory functions in malignant and non-malignant diseases is an active
      area of research. Ongoing and future research can inform the development of
      immunotherapies that target basophils to impact allergic, autoimmune, and
      malignant disease states. This review article aims to provide an overview of
      basophil biology, identification strategies, and roles and dysregulation in
      diseases.

TI  - Enhancing co-stimulation of CAR T cells to improve treatment outcomes in solid
      cancers.
PG  - ltab016
LID - 10.1093/immadv/ltab016 [doi]
AB  - Co-stimulation is a fundamental component of T cell biology and plays a key role 
      in determining the quality of T cell proliferation, differentiation, and memory
      formation. T cell-based immunotherapies, such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) 
      T cell immunotherapy, are no exception. Solid tumours have largely been
      refractory to CAR T cell therapy owing to an immunosuppressive microenvironment
      which limits CAR T cell persistence and effector function. In order to eradicate 
      solid cancers, increasingly sophisticated strategies are being developed to
      deliver these vital co-stimulatory signals to CAR T cells, often specifically
      within the tumour microenvironment. These include designing novel co-stimulatory 
      domains within the CAR or other synthetic receptors, arming CAR T cells with
      cytokines or using CAR T cells in combination with agonist antibodies. This
      review discusses the evolving role of co-stimulation in CAR T cell therapies and 
      the strategies employed to target co-stimulatory pathways in CAR T cells, with a 
      view to improve responses in solid tumours.

TI  - MicroRNAs: immune modulators in cancer immunotherapy.
PG  - ltab006
LID - 10.1093/immadv/ltab006 [doi]
AB  - MicroRNA (miRNA) is a class of endogenous small non-coding RNA of 18-25
      nucleotides and plays regulatory roles in both physiological and pathological
      processes. Emerging evidence support that miRNAs function as immune modulators in
      tumors. MiRNAs as tumor suppressors or oncogenes are also found to be able to
      modulate anti-tumor immunity or link the crosstalk between tumor cells and immune
      cells surrounding. Based on the specific regulating function, miRNAs can be used 
      as predictive, prognostic biomarkers, and therapeutic targets in immunotherapy.
      Here, we review new findings about the role of miRNAs in modulating immune
      responses, as well as discuss mechanisms underlying their dysregulation, and
      their clinical potentials as indicators of tumor prognosis or to sensitize cancer
      immunotherapy.

PG  - ltab001
LID - 10.1093/immadv/ltab001 [doi]
AB  - After initial introduction for B-cell lymphomas as adjuvant therapies to
      established cancer treatments, immune checkpoint inhibitors and other
      immunotherapies are now integrated in mainstream regimens, both in adult and
      pediatric patients. We here provide an overview of the current status of
      combination therapies for B-cell lymphoma, by in-depth analysis of combination
      therapy trials registered between 2015-2020. Our analysis provides new insight
      into the rapid evolution in lymphoma treatment, as propelled by new additions to 
      the treatment arsenal. We conclude with prospects on upcoming clinical trials
      which will likely use systematic testing approaches of more combinations of
      established chemotherapy regimens with new agents, as well as new combinations of
      immunotherapy and targeted therapy. Future trials will be set up as basket or
      umbrella-type trials to facilitate the evaluation of new drugs targeting specific
      genetic changes in the tumor or associated immune microenvironment. As such,
      lymphoma patients will benefit by receiving more tailored treatment that is based
      on synergistic effects of chemotherapy combined with new agents targeting
      specific aspects of tumor biology and the immune system.

TI  - Unveiling the interplay between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic
      mechanisms in copper-iron nanoparticles working under chemically relevant tumour 
      conditions.
PG  - 8307-8320
LID - 10.1039/d2sc01379g [doi]
AB  - The present work sheds light on a generally overlooked issue in the emerging
      field of bio-orthogonal catalysis within tumour microenvironments (TMEs): the
      interplay between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic processes. In most
      cases, previous works dealing with nanoparticle-based catalysis in the TME focus 
      on the effects obtained (e.g. tumour cell death) and attribute the results to
      heterogeneous processes alone. The specific mechanisms are rarely substantiated
      and, furthermore, the possibility of a significant contribution of homogeneous
      processes by leached species - and the complexes that they may form with
      biomolecules - is neither contemplated nor pursued. Herein, we have designed a
      bimetallic catalyst nanoparticle containing Cu and Fe species and we have been
      able to describe the whole picture in a more complex scenario where both
      homogeneous and heterogeneous processes are coupled and fostered under TME
      relevant chemical conditions. We investigate the preferential leaching of Cu ions
      in the presence of a TME overexpressed biomolecule such as glutathione (GSH). We 
      demonstrate that these homogeneous processes initiated by the released by Cu-GSH 
      interactions are in fact responsible for the greater part of the cell death
      effects found (GSH, a scavenger of reactive oxygen species, is depleted and
      highly active superoxide anions are generated in the same catalytic cycle). The
      remaining solid CuFe nanoparticle becomes an active catalyst to supply oxygen
      from oxygen reduced species, such as superoxide anions (by-product from GSH
      oxidation) and hydrogen peroxide, another species that is enriched in the TME.
      This activity is essential to sustain the homogeneous catalytic cycle in the
      oxygen-deprived tumour microenvironment. The combined heterogeneous-homogeneous
      mechanisms revealed themselves as highly efficient in selectively killing cancer 
      cells, due to their higher GSH levels compared to healthy cell lines.

AB  - A 68-year-old man presented with septic shock and severe perineal pain from a
      perforated low-rectal cancer causing a perineal necrotizing soft tissue
      infection. He underwent laparoscopic diverting colostomy and multiple surgical
      debridements resulting in extensive perineal and left leg wounds. A
      multidisciplinary rectal cancer team recommended against neoadjuvant
      chemoradiation or chemotherapy in his current state. He underwent up-front,
      urgent robotic-assisted abdominoperineal resection with immediate oblique rectus 
      abdominus muscle flap closure. Final pathology demonstrated a T4N1b
      adenocarcinoma with negative resection margins. The patient subsequently
      underwent adjuvant chemotherapy. Now at over 18 months, he remains cancer free.

TI  - Minimally invasive esophagectomy in the semi-prone position for corrosive
      esophagitis: a case report.
PG  - rjac218
LID - 10.1093/jscr/rjac218 [doi]
AB  - Treatment strategies for corrosive esophagitis include conservative treatment,
      such as balloon dilatation at the stenosis site, and surgical treatment.
      Esophagectomy for corrosive esophagitis is usually performed through the
      transthoracic or transhiatal approaches. Herein, we report a case of corrosive
      esophagitis treated with thoracoscopic esophagectomy with the patient in the
      semi-prone position. The patient was a 48-year-old woman who developed corrosive 
      esophagitis due to accidental ingestion of an alkaline agent. Surgical
      intervention was required for esophageal stenosis. Therefore, thoracoscopic
      esophagectomy was performed with the patient in the semi-prone position with
      bilateral pulmonary ventilation. In our hospital, good operative outcomes have
      been obtained using thoracoscopic esophagectomy for esophageal cancer with the
      patient in the semi-prone position with bilateral pulmonary ventilation. This
      technique is also considered effective for the treatment of corrosive
      esophagitis.

AB  - A 45-year-old man with a 10-year history of biopsy-proven, steroid-dependent
      sclerosing mesenteritis failed/was intolerant to tamoxifen, azathioprine,
      colchicine, cyclophosphamide, and methotrexate. He developed osteoporosis,
      diabetes, and bilateral cataracts. He responded to infliximab but was diagnosed
      with mesenteric large B-cell lymphoma 6 months after treatment initiation. He
      achieved remission from lymphoma after chemotherapy, but the sclerosing
      mesenteritis remained poorly controlled. He was treated with ustekinumab (520 mg 
      intravenously followed by 90 mg subcutaneously every 8 weeks), leading to
      complete steroid-free remission. He remains symptom and cancer-free 24 months
      after starting ustekinumab.

TI  - Recove(R) burn ointment for managing acute radiodermatitis in patients with
      breast cancer: A double blind randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 349-355
LID - 10.22088/cjim.13.2. [doi]
AB  - Background: Radiodermatitis is the most common complication of radiotherapy.
      There is no gold standard for managing the radiodermatitis. This study aimed to
      evaluate the effect of topical Recove((R)) burn ointment; basically compounded of
      sesame oil, camphor, and zinc oxide; in preventing acute radiodermatitis.
      Methods: This double blind RCT (IRCT No.: 201204047136N2) was performed on 71
      patients that referred for radiotherapy after mastectomy to Shahid Rajaee
      Hospital (Babolsar-Iran) during 2013-2017. Patients were allocated into 2 groups;
      34 in control group and 37 in Recove((R)) group. Patients applied the ointment 2 
      times a day, before every radiation therapy session for 5 weeks. The radiation
      oncologist assessed the severity of dermatitis weekly for 5 weeks and graded it
      from 0 to 4 according to the RTOG criteria. Results: Baseline characteristics
      including age, and BMI had no significant difference between groups. The Recover 
      group patients experienced significantly less severe dermatitis compared to the
      controls (p<0.001). None of the patients in Recove(R) group encountered more than
      grade 2 of RTOG criteria, however, in the control group, 4 (12.9%) patients
      experienced grade 3 of RTOG and 3 (9.7%) patients developed grade 4 of RTOG at
      the end of the 5(th) week. Conclusion: Our results indicate that Recove((R))
      ointment significantly reduces the severity of acute radiodermatitis.

      nausea and vomiting: A randomized clinical trial.
PG  - 356-362
LID - 10.22088/cjim.13.2.6 [doi]
AB  - Background: Chemotherapy inducing nausea and vomiting (CINV) is one of the
      significant side effects of anti-cancer treatment, and its full prevention is a
      potential challenge. This study was done to specify the effect of olanzapine in
      this setting. Methods: In this randomized, double-blind, clinical trial study,
      olanzapine was compared with a placebo in combination with dexamethasone and
      granisetrone in patients with cancer. Patients in the intervention group received
      dexamethasone , granisetron and olanzapine. Patients in the control group
      received a placebo instead of olanzapine. Overall, acute nausea and vomiting
      prevention were the primary and secondary end points; complete response (no
      nausea,no vomiting) in the delayed period of chemotherapy was the third end
      point. Response to treatment was evaluated by the Functional Living Index Emesis 
      (FLIE) questionnaire completion in the first, the third and the fifth of
      chemotherapy. Results: Percentage reduction in mean+/-SD nausea and vomiting in
      the overall phase (0-120 hours) of intervention group compared to the control
      group respectively were 29.94+/-2.06, 69.75+/-2.32 [(57.93% reduction (p<0.001)].
      For the acute phase (0-24 hours) were 26.08+/-2.36, 51.85+/-2.24 [(47.21%
      reduction (p<0.001)], for the delayed phase (24-120 hours), were 31.26+/-2.57,
      67.91+/-2.12 ,[(55.11% reduction;(p<0.001)] respectively. Conclusion: Olanzapine,
      along with dexamethasone and granisetron, significantly reduced vomiting and
      nausea in patients undergoing chemotherapy. No adverse event of olanzapine was
      observed in the patients.

      gastric biopsy specimens were taken from each subject. Data were analyzed using
      chi-square and logistic regression tests. Results: A total of 150 patients with
      mean age of 65.8+/-11.9 years old participated in this study. Sixty-three (42%)
      patients were males. Thirty-four (22.6%) patients had precancerous lesions.
      Ninety (60%) patients had positive PCR results for H. pylori. H. pylori infection
      test was positive in 24 (70.6%) patients with precancerous lesion. Sixty-six
      (57%) patients without the precancerous lesions (116 cases) were positive for H. 
      pylori. Conclusion: There was no a significant difference in the rate of H.
      pylori infection and its genotype distribution was between patients with and
      without the precancerous lesions.

TI  - Curcumin as adjuvant therapy to improve remission in myeloma patients: A pilot
      randomized clinical trial.
PG  - 375-384
LID - 10.22088/cjim.13.2.9 [doi]
AB  - Background: The treatment for ineligible transplant multiple myeloma is melphalan
      prednisone. Curcumin has an anti-inflammatory and antiangiogenesis in
      cancer-directed to nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) pathway. Interleukin 6 (IL-6), 
      vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), tumor necrosis factor-alpha
      (TNF-alpha), C-reactive protein (CRP), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were also 
      involved in the pathogenesis of myeloma. No clinical study has evaluated the
      efficacy of curcumin in myeloma patients. To evaluate the efficacy of curcumin as
      adjuvant into melphalan prednisone in myeloma patients. Methods: 33 myeloma
      patients at Dr. Kariadi General Hospital, Semarang, Indonesia during 2016-2017
      were randomly assigned single-blindedly into MPC (n=17) and control group (n=16).
      The MPC group was treated with melphalan 4 mg/m2, prednisone 40 mg/m2 for 7 days,
      and curcumin 8 gram daily for 28 days. The MP control group was treated with
      melphalan, prednisone, and placebo. The primary endpoint was the overall
      remission. Pre- and post-treatment was examined for NF-kappaB, VEGF, TNF-alpha,
      IL-6, LDH, and CRP levels All data analyses were per protocol. Results: There was
      a significant difference in overall remission between the MPC and MP control
      groups [75%vs 33.3%, x(2)=6.89, P=0.009]. A significant decrease of NF-kappaB,
      VEGF, TNF-alpha levels were shown in the MPC group compared with the MP control
      group. There was a significant decrease in IL-6 levels in a subgroup analysis of 
      the MPC group. TNF-alpha levels had a significant correlation with remission
      [OR=1.35; (95%CI=1.03-1.76); P=0.03]. Conclusion: Curcumin has an efficacy in
      improving overall remission and decreasing NF-kappaB, VEGF, TNF-alpha, and IL-6
      levels in myeloma patients.

TI  - Using a two-step method of surface mechanical attrition treatment and calcium ion
      implantation to promote the osteogenic activity of mesenchymal stem cells as well
      as biomineralization on a beta-titanium surface.
PG  - 20037-20053
LID - 10.1039/d2ra00032f [doi]
AB  - Surface treatment is known as a very efficient measure by which to modulate the
      surface properties of biomaterials in terms of grain structure, topography,
      roughness and chemistry to determine the osseointegration of implants. In this
      work, a two-step method of surface modification was employed to impart high
      osteogenic activity and biomineralization capacity on a Ti-25Nb-3Mo-2Sn-3Zr alloy
      (a type of beta-titanium named TLM). The preliminary surface mechanical attrition
      treatment (SMAT) refined the average grain size from 170 +/- 19 mum to 74 +/- 8
      nm in the TLM surface layer and promoted the surface to be much rougher and more 
      hydrophilic. The subsequent Ca-ion implantation did not change the surface
      roughness and topography obviously, but enhanced the surface wettability of the
      SMAT-treated TLM alloy. The in vitro evaluations of the adhesion, proliferation, 
      osteogenic genes (RUNX2, ALP, BMP-2, OPN, OCN and COL-I) and protein (ALP, OPN,
      OCN and COL-I) expressions, as well as extracellular matrix (ECM) mineralization 
      of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) revealed that the initial SMAT-treated sample
      significantly enhanced the adhesion and osteogenic functions of MSCs compared to 
      an untreated TLM sample, and the subsequent introduction of Ca ions onto the
      SMAT-derived nanograined sample further promotes the MSC adhesion, proliferation,
      osteo-differentiation and ECM mineralization due to the adsorption of more
      proteins such as laminin (Ln), fibronectin (Fn) and vitronectin (Vn) on the
      surface, as well as the increase in extracellular Ca concentrations. In addition,
      the biomineralization capacity of the samples was also evaluated by soaking them 
      in simulated bodily fluid (SBF) at 37 degrees C for 28 days, and the results
      showed that the Ca-ion implanted sample significantly boosted the deposition of
      Ca and P containing minerals on its surface, which was associated with the
      generation of more Ti-OH groups on the surface after ion implantation. The
      combination of the SMAT technique and Ca-ion implantation thus endowed the TLM
      alloy with outstanding osteogenic and biomineralization properties, providing a
      potential means for its future use in the orthopedic field.

TI  - Anticancer potential of beta-sitosterol and oleanolic acid as through inhibition 
      of human estrogenic 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type-1 based on an in
      silico approach.
PG  - 20319-20329
LID - 10.1039/d2ra03092f [doi]
AB  - The human estrogenic enzyme 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type-1 (HSD17B1) 
      provides biosynthesis regulation of active estrogen in stimulating the
      development of breast cancer through cell proliferation. The beta-sitosterol is
      classified as a steroid compound and is actually a type of triterpenoid compound 
      that has a similar structure to a steroid. This similarity provides a great
      opportunity for the inhibitor candidate to bind to the HDS17B1 enzyme because of 
      the template similarity on the active site. Several in silico approaches have
      been applied in this study to examine the potential of these two inhibitor
      candidates. Pharmacokinetic studies showed positive results by meeting several
      drug candidate criteria, such as drug-likeness, bioavailability, and ADMET
      properties. A combination of molecular docking and MD simulation showed good
      conformational interaction of the inhibitors and HSD17B1. Prediction of binding
      free energy (DeltaG bind) using the Molecular Mechanics-Generalized Born Surface 
      Area (MM-GBSA) approach shows DeltaG bind (kcal mol(-1)) of C1-HSD17B1: -49.31
      +/- 0.23 and C2-HSD17B1: -33.54 +/- 0.34. Meanwhile, decomposition energy
      analysis (DeltaG (residue) bind) suggested several key residues that were also
      responsible for the interaction with inhibitors, such as C1-HSD17B1 (six
      residues: Leu96, Leu149, Pro187, Met193, Val225, and Phe226) and C2-HSD17B1 (four
      residues: Ile14, Gly94, Pro187, and Val188). Hopefully, the obtained results from
      this research could be considered for the mechanistic inhibition of the HSDS17B1 
      enzyme at molecular and atomistic levels.

AB  - Metal complexes have gradually been attracting interest from researchers
      worldwide as potential cancer therapeutics. Driven by the many side effects of
      the popular platinum-based anticancer drug cisplatin, the tireless endeavours of 
      researchers have afforded strategies for the design of appropriate metal
      complexes with minimal side effects compared to cisplatin and its congeners to
      limit the unrestricted propagation of cancer. In this regard, transition metal
      complexes, especially rhenium-based complexes are being identified and
      highlighted as promising cancer theranostics, which are endowed with the ability 
      to detect and annihilate cancer cells in the body. This is attributed the amazing
      photophysical properties of rhenium complexes together with their ability to
      selectively attack different organelles in cancer cells. Therefore, this review
      presents the properties of different rhenium-based complexes to highlight their
      recent advances as anticancer agents based on their cytotoxicity results.

TI  - The Advent of Nutrigenomics: A Narrative Review with an Emphasis on Psychological
      Disorders.
PG  - 150-164
LID - 10.3746/pnf.2022.27.2.150 [doi]
AB  - A new research field is emerging that combines nutrition and genetics at the
      molecular level, namely nutrigenomics. Several aspects of nutrigenomics are
      examined in this review, with a particular focus on psychological disorders. The 
      origin of this field in the 20th century and its modern developments have been
      investigated. Various studies have reported the impact of genetic factors and
      diet on various chronic disorders, elucidating how the deficiency of several
      macronutrients results in significant ailments, including diabetes, cancer,
      cardiovascular disorders, and others. Furthermore, the application of
      nutrigenomics to diet and its impact on the global disease rate and quality of
      life have been discussed. The relationship between diet and gene expression can
      facilitate the classification of diet-gene interactions and the diagnosis of
      polymorphisms and anomalies. Numerous databases and research tools for the study 
      of nutrigenomics are essential to the medical application of this field. The
      nutrition-gene interrelationships can be utilized to study brain development,
      impairment, and diseases, which could be a significant medical breakthrough. It
      has also been observed that psychological conditions are exacerbated by the
      interaction between gut microbes and the prevalence of malnutrition. This article
      focuses on the impact of nutrition on genes involved in various psychological
      disorders and the potential application of nutrigenomics as a revolutionary
      treatment method.

TI  - Anti-Obesity Effect of Rice Bran Extract on High-Fat Diet-Induced Obese Mice.
PG  - 172-179
LID - 10.3746/pnf.2022.27.2.172 [doi]
AB  - Obesity involving adipose tissue growth and development are associated with
      angiogenesis and extracellular matrix remodeling. Rice bran has antioxidant and
      cardioprotective properties, and can act as a food supplement with potential
      health benefits, such as lowering blood pressure, hepatic steatosis, and
      inflammation. Therefore, we hypothesized that rice bran extract (RBE) can
      regulate adipose tissue growth and obesity. Male Institute of Cancer Research
      mice were fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks and then supplemented with
      220 and 1,100 mg/kg/d RBE while the low-fat diet group (control) were not. In
      addition to body weight, adipose tissue mass, and vessel density, we evaluated
      the mRNA expression of angiogenic factors such as matrix metalloproteinases,
      Mmp-2, Mmp-9, and the vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegf) in visceral and
      subcutaneous adipose tissues using real-time polymerase chain reaction.
      Administration of RBE to HFD-induced obese mice reduced the body weight and
      adipose tissue mass compared with untreated mice. It also decreased blood vessel 
      density in the adipose tissue. Furthermore, RBE downregulated Vegf and Mmp-2 mRNA
      levels in visceral fat tissue. These results demonstrate that RBE, at high
      concentrations, significantly reduces adipose tissue mass and prevents obesity
      development in HFD-induced obese mice, which might be partly mediated via an
      anti-angiogenic mechanism.

TI  - Identification of Ten-Gene Related to Lipid Metabolism for Predicting Overall
      Survival of Breast Invasive Carcinoma.
PG  - 8348780
LID - 10.1155/2022/8348780 [doi]
AB  - Background: Predicting the risk of poor prognosis of breast cancer is crucial to 
      treating breast cancer. This study investigated the prognostic assessment of 10
      lipid metabolism-related genes constructed as breast cancer models based on this 
      study. Methods: The TCGA database was used to obtain clinical information and
      expression data of breast cancer patients, and GSEA analysis and univariate and
      multivariate Cox proportional risk regression models were performed to identify
      lipid metabolism genes closely associated with overall survival (OS) of breast
      cancer patients and to construct a prognostic risk score model based on lipid
      metabolism gene markers. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze the survival
      status of patients with high and low-risk scores, and ROC curves assessed the
      accuracy of this risk score. Finally, the relationship between this risk score
      and clinicopathological characteristics of BRCA was analyzed in a stratified
      manner, and the validity of this risk score as an independent prognostic factor
      was determined using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses.
      Results: One hundred and forty-four differentially expressed lipid
      metabolism-related genes were identified in cancer and paracancerous tissues in
      BRCA, 21 of which were associated with overall survival (OS) in BRCA (P < 0.05). 
      Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses revealed that age, grade, and risk score
      were independent prognostic factors for BRCA. Multivariate Cox regression
      analysis further identified APOL4, NR1H3, SLC25A5, APOL3, OSBPL1A, DYNLT1, IMMT, 
      MAP2K6, ZDHHC8, and RAB2A lipid metabolism-related genes as independent
      prognostic markers for BRCA. A prognostic risk score model was developed by
      labeling lipid metabolism genes with these 10 genes, and patients with BRCA with 
      high-risk scores in the model sample had significantly worse OS than those with
      low-risk (P < 0.01). The ROC curve area (AUC) of this risk score model was 0.712.
      Conclusion: By mining the TCGA database, we identified 10 lipid
      metabolism-related genes APOL4, NR1H3, SLC25A5, APOL3, OSBPL1A, DYNLT1, IMMT,
      MAP2K6, ZDHHC8, and RAB2A, which are closely related to the prognosis of BRCA
      patients, and constructed a prognostic risk scoring system based on 10 lipid
      metabolism genes tags.

TI  - Establishment of an efficient ex vivo expansion strategy for human natural killer
      cells stimulated by defined cytokine cocktail and antibodies against natural
      killer cell activating receptors.
PG  - 185-191
LID - 10.1016/j.reth.2022.07.001 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Cell-based immunotherapy is categorized as a regenerative therapy
      under the Regenerative Medicine Safety Act in Japan. Natural killer (NK)
      cell-based immunotherapy is considered a promising strategy for treating cancer, 
      including glioblastoma (GBM). We previously reported an expansion method for
      highly purified human peripheral blood-derived NK cells using a cytokine
      cocktail. Here, we aimed to establish a more efficient NK cell expansion method
      as compared to our previously reported method. Methods: T cell-depleted human
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from three healthy
      volunteers. The depleted PBMCs were cultured in the presence of recombinant human
      interleukin (rhIL)-18 and high-dose rhIL-2 in anti-NKp46 and/or anti-CD16
      antibody immobilization settings. After 14 days of expansion, the purity and
      expansion ratio of CD3-CD56+ NK cells were determined. The cytotoxicity-mediated 
      growth inhibition of T98G cells (an NK activity-sensitive GBM cell line) was
      evaluated using a non-labeling, impedance-based real-time cell analyzer. Results:
      Anti-NKp46 stimulation increased the NK cell purity and expansion ratio as
      compared to the non-antibody-stimulated population. Anti-CD16 stimulation weakly 
      enhanced the NK cell expansion ratio of the non-antibody-stimulated population
      and enhanced the NK cell purity and expansion ratio of anti-NKp46-stimulated
      populations. All NK cell-containing populations tested distinctly inhibited T98G 
      cell growth. These effects tended to be enhanced in an NK cell purity-dependent
      manner. In some cases, anti-CD16 stimulation decreased growth inhibition of T98G 
      cell compared to other conditions despite the comparable NK cell purity.
      Conclusions: We established a robust large-scale feeder-free expansion system for
      highly purified human NK cells using a defined cytokine cocktail and anti-NK cell
      activating receptor antibodies. The expansion system could be feasible for
      autologous or allogeneic NK cell-based immunotherapy of GBM. Moreover, it is
      easily controlled under Japanese law on regenerative medicine.

      inhibitors.
PG  - ltac008
LID - 10.1093/immadv/ltac008 [doi]
AB  - Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have provided new hope for cancer patients,
      and in particular for patients with tumors that are immunologically active and
      classified as hot tumors. These tumors express antigenic and tumor
      microenvironment (TME) characteristics that make them potential candidates for
      therapy with checkpoint inhibitors that aim to reactivate the immune response
      such as anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4. Examples of potentially responsive cancers
      are, melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer and several other metastatic or
      unresectable tumors with genetic instability: DNA mismatch repair deficiency
      (dMMR), microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H), or with a high tumor mutational 
      burden (TMB). Immunotherapy using checkpoint inhibitors is typically associated
      with adverse events (AEs) that are milder than those with chemotherapy. However, 
      a significant percentage of patients develop short-term immune-related AEs
      (irAEs) which range from mild (~70%) to severe cases (~13%) that can lead to
      modifications of the checkpoint inhibitor therapy and in some cases, death. While
      some studies have investigated immune mechanisms behind the development of irAEs,
      much more research is needed to understand the mechanisms and to develop
      interventions that could attenuate severe irAEs, while maintaining the anti-tumor
      response intact. Moreover, studies to identify biomarkers that can predict the
      likelihood of a patient developing severe irAEs would be of great clinical
      importance. Here we discuss some of the clinical ramifications of irAEs,
      potential immune mechanisms behind their development and studies that have
      investigated potentially useful biomarkers of irAEs development.

AB  - The development of novel chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) cell therapies is
      rapidly growing, with 299 new agents being reported and 109 new clinical trials
      initiated so far this year. One critical lesson from approved CD19-specific CAR
      therapies is that target isoform switching has been shown to cause tumour
      relapse, but little is known about the isoforms of CAR targets in solid cancers. 
      Here we assess the protein isoform landscape and identify both the challenges and
      opportunities protein isoform switching present as CAR therapy is applied to
      solid cancers.

AB  - Cell therapy is an innovative approach that permits numerous possibilities in the
      field of cancer treatment. CAR-T cells have been successfully used in patients
      with hematologic relapsed/refractory. However, the need for autologous sources
      for T cells is still a major drawback. CAR-NK cells have emerged as a promising
      resource using allogeneic cells that could be established as an off-the-shelf
      treatment. NK cells can be obtained from various sources, such as peripheral
      blood (PB), bone marrow, umbilical cord blood (CB), and induced pluripotent stem 
      cells (iPSC), as well as cell lines. Genetic engineering of NK cells to express
      different CAR constructs for hematological cancers and solid tumors has shown
      promising preclinical results and they are currently being explored in multiple
      clinical trials. Several strategies have been employed to improve CAR-NK-cell
      expansion and cytotoxicity efficiency. In this article, we review the latest
      achievements and progress made in the field of CAR-NK-cell therapy.

TI  - Combination of genetically engineered T cells and immune checkpoint blockade for 
      the treatment of cancer.
PG  - ltac005
LID - 10.1093/immadv/ltac005 [doi]
AB  - Immune checkpoint (IC) blockade using monoclonal antibodies is currently one of
      the most successful immunotherapeutic interventions to treat cancer. By
      reinvigorating antitumor exhausted T cells, this approach can lead to durable
      clinical responses. However, the majority of patients either do not respond or
      present a short-lived response to IC blockade, in part due to a scarcity of
      tumor-specific T cells within the tumor microenvironment. Adoptive transfer of T 
      cells genetically engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) or
      engineered T-cell receptors (TCRs) provide the necessary tumor-specific immune
      cell population to target cancer cells. However, this therapy has been
      considerably ineffective against solid tumors in part due to IC-mediated
      immunosuppressive effects within the tumor microenvironment. These limitations
      could be overcome by associating adoptive cell transfer of genetically engineered
      T cells and IC blockade. In this comprehensive review, we highlight the
      strategies and outcomes of preclinical and clinical attempts to disrupt IC
      signaling in adoptive T-cell transfer against cancer. These strategies include
      combined administration of genetically engineered T cells and IC inhibitors,
      engineered T cells with intrinsic modifications to disrupt IC signaling, and the 
      design of CARs against IC molecules. The current landscape indicates that the
      synergy of the fast-paced refinements of gene-editing technologies and synthetic 
      biology and the increased comprehension of IC signaling will certainly translate 
      into a novel and more effective immunotherapeutic approaches to treat patients
      with cancer.

AB  - Background: There is limited data available on potential biological effects of
      E-cigarettes on human oral tissues. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
      effects of E-cigarette liquid on the proliferation of normal and cancerous
      monolayer and 3D models of human oral mucosa and oral wound healing after
      short-term and medium-term exposure. Methods: Normal human oral fibroblasts
      (NOF), immortalized OKF6-TERET-2 human oral keratinocytes, and cancerous TR146
      keratinocyte monolayer cultures and 3D tissue engineered oral mucosal models were
      exposed to different concentrations (0.1%, 1%, 5% and 10%) of E-cigarette liquid 
      (12 mg/ml nicotine) for 1 hour daily for three days and for 7 days. Tissue
      viability was monitored using the PrestoBlue assay. Wounds were also produced in 
      the middle surface of the monolayer systems vertically using a disposable cell
      scraper. The alterations in the cell morphology and wound healing were visualized
      using light microscopy and histological examination. Results: Statistical
      analysis showed medium-term exposure of TR146 keratinocytes to 5% and 10%
      E-liquid concentrations significantly increased the viability of the cancer cells
      compared to the negative control. Short-term exposure of NOFs to 10% E-liquid
      significantly reduced the cell viability, whereas medium-term exposure to all
      E-liquid concentrations significantly reduced the NOF cells' viability. OKF6
      cells exhibited significantly lower viability following short-term and mediumterm
      exposure to all E-cigarette concentrations compared to the negative control. 3D
      oral mucosal model containing normal oral fibroblasts and keratinocytes showed
      significant reduction in tissue viability after exposure to 10% E-liquid, whereas
      medium-term exposure resulted in significantly lower viability in 5% and 10%
      concentration groups compared to the negative control. There was a statistically 
      significant difference in wound healing times of both NOF and OKF6 cells after
      exposure to 1%, 5% and 10% E-cigarette liquid. Conclusion: Medium-term exposure
      to high concentrations of the E-cigarette liquid had cytotoxic effects on normal 
      human oral fibroblasts and OKF6 keratinocytes, but a stimulatory cumulative
      effect on the growth of cancerous TR146 keratinocyte cells as assessed by the
      PrestoBlue assay and histological evaluation of 3D oral mucosal models. In
      addition, E-liquid exposure prolonged the wound healing of NOF and OKF6 oral
      mucosa cells.

TI  - Presumptive metastatic leiomyosarcoma in a feedlot steer.
PG  - 819-824
AB  - A 14-month-old feedlot steer was depressed and died while being examined. The
      gross post-mortem examination of the steer conducted at the feedlot identified
      numerous masses within the abdomen and thorax, including a large mass in the
      liver that eroded into the vena cava. Many masses in the lungs appeared to be the
      result of hematogenous distribution. Histologic examination of the masses
      confirmed the presence of neoplasia. Although the histologic appearance of the
      neoplasms was not typical of well-differentiated leiomyosarcoma,
      immunohistochemical staining supported that diagnosis. Leiomyosarcomas are rare
      among North American cattle. In this case, the primary neoplasm appears to have
      originated in the wall of the vena cava within the liver. Key clinical message:
      This report adds to the limited information on leiomyosarcomas in cattle, while
      highlighting both the challenges faced by veterinarians conducting post-mortem
      examinations on large animals in below freezing temperatures, as well as the
      current methods available to arrive at a diagnosis of a rare disease.

      reveals three immune subtypes with implications for immunotherapy.

LID - 10.1016/j.omto.2022.07.001 [doi]
AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is highly heterogeneous. Molecular subtyping for
      guiding immunotherapy is warranted. Previous studies have indicated that enhancer
      RNAs (eRNAs) are involved in tumor heterogeneity and immune infiltration.
      However, the eRNA landscape and its correlation with immune infiltration in HCC
      remain unknown. Here we first revealed the genome-wide eRNA landscape in two HCC 
      cohorts. Then we divided individuals with HCC into three immune-related clusters 
      (C1, C2, and C3) based on eRNA expression profiles. The prognosis, biological
      properties, immune infiltration, clinical features, genomic features, and drug
      response were analyzed. C1 was enriched in immune infiltration and potentially
      sensitive to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). C2 displayed features of immune
      depletion, high proliferation activity, malignant clinical features, and the
      worst prognosis. C2 may benefit from targeted therapy. C3 presented moderate
      immune infiltration, metabolism-related signatures, and the best prognosis.
      Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) may be effective for C3. Finally, we
      constructed a 51-eRNA classifier for subtype prediction and validated its
      efficacy in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort and Sun Yat-sen University
      Cancer Center (SYSUCC) cohort. Our results provide a novel method for immune
      classification of HCC, shed new light on tumor heterogeneity, and may aid in HCC 
      immunotherapy.

AB  - Introduction: There is a large body of epidemiological evidence showing
      significantly increased mortality risks from air pollution and temperature.
      However, findings on the modification of the association between air pollution
      and mortality by temperature are mixed. Methods: We used a varying coefficient
      distributed lag model to assess the complex interplay between air temperature and
      PM2.5 on daily mortality in Guangzhou City from 2013 to 2020, with the aim of
      establishing the PM2.5-mortality association at different temperatures and
      exploring synergetic mortality risks from PM2.5 and temperature on vulnerable
      populations. Results: We observed near-linear concentration-response associations
      between PM2.5 and mortality across different temperature levels. Each 10 mug/m(3)
      increase of PM2.5 in low, medium, and high temperature strata was associated with
      increments of 0.73% [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.38%, 1.09%], 0.12% (95% CI: 
      -0.27%, 0.52%), and 0.46% (95% CI: 0.11%, 0.81%) in non-accidental mortality,
      with a statistically significant difference between low and medium temperatures
      (P=0.02). There were significant modification effects of PM2.5 by low temperature
      for cardiovascular mortality and among individuals 75 years or older.
      Conclusions: Low temperatures may exacerbate physiological responses to
      short-term PM2.5 exposure in Guangzhou, China.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide.
      Spontaneous regression of HCC due to autoinfarction is rare. This case series
      describes 2 cases of HCC autoinfarction that affected transplant candidacy: 1
      patient previously ineligible because of tumor size and not meeting the Milan
      criteria became eligible after autoinfarction and tumor shrinkage while the
      second one was delisted in the view of improved symptoms of chronic liver disease
      and significant HCC regression. These cases provide an opportunity to review the 
      pathogenesis of HCC autoinfarction and to remind practitioners of how this entity
      might alter decision-making around transplant eligibility.

AB  - We present a patient with untreated hepatitis C virus and metastatic
      hepatocellular carcinoma treated with combination immunotherapy who developed
      elevated liver enzymes. The immunotherapy was withheld, and the liver enzymes
      continued to rise. A liver biopsy was performed, which demonstrated findings
      consistent with chronic viral hepatitis. Direct-acting antiviral treatment was
      initiated, and the liver enzymes returned to normal limits. This case
      demonstrates the diagnostic dilemmas raised among patients with hepatocellular
      carcinoma on immunotherapy who develop elevated liver enzymes and some of the
      challenges regarding the use of these medications in patients with viremic
      hepatitis C virus.

TI  - 18F-Choline PET/CT or PET/MR and the evaluation of response to systemic therapy
      in prostate cancer: are we ready?
PG  - 1-9
LID - 10.1007/s40336-022-00515-7 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: During the last decade, [18F]F-choline positron emission tomography
      (PET) had a rising role in prostate cancer (PCa) imaging. However, despite
      auspicious premises, [18F]F-choline PET is not currently recommended for the
      evaluation of response to therapy assessment in PCa, mainly due to the lack of
      large-scale prospective trials. Methods: We report the cases of seven patients
      affected by PCa, in which [18F]F-choline PET (either with computed tomography-CT 
      or magnetic resonance imaging-MR) contributed significantly in the systemic
      therapy response evaluation. Results and conclusion: [18F]F-choline PET/CT or
      PET/MR demonstrated to be a useful imaging modality in the assessment of response
      to systemic therapy in metastatic PCa patients, irrespective of the stage of
      disease (either in hormone sensitive and in castrate resistant condition) and the
      kind of systemic treatment. In most cases, PSA serum values and [18F]F-choline
      PET showed a synchronous disease evolution after systemic therapy. ADT can alter 
      [18F]F-choline uptake, therefore the time of scan should be correctly planned.
      Finally, PET/CT with [18F]F-choline is a useful tool for reinforcing the
      identification of metastatic disease in case of a switch from metastatic
      castration sensitive to castration resistant PCa.

AB  - Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is generally uncovered in sun-exposed areas, secondary
      to chronic unprotected UV exposure. The most common sites for nodular basal cells
      are the face, especially the nose, cheeks, forehead, nasolabial folds, and
      eyelids, with a history of crusting and friability. The commencement of BCC is 10
      to 15 years from epidermal damage. Here, we report the case of a 52-year-old
      Caucasian female who presented to her primary care with an enlarging bump on the 
      scalp for the past five years, which became tender and friable two months before 
      the visit. The patient was clinically diagnosed with a solitary cyst and was
      referred for surgical excision. The pathology of the excised specimen revealed it
      to be a BCC.

      around 4.4 billion, with the majority of individuals affected in developing
      countries. Chronic infection of the gram-negative bacterium results in several
      gastrointestinal pathologies such as chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer, and cancer.
      Probiotics compete directly with H. pylori and help restore the gut microbial
      environment; these living microorganisms are comparatively more effective than
      the standard triple antibiotic regimen in the management of symptoms related to
      the pathogenic bacteria. The need for alternative therapy is better explained by 
      the increasing rate of antibiotic resistance and the lowering of patient
      compliance to the standard treatment. Adjuvant administration of probiotics to H.
      pylori eradication therapy is associated with a higher H. pylori eradication
      rate, decreased diarrhea-related treatment, less common self-reported side
      effects, and higher treatment compliance. Therefore, with the ongoing and future 
      resistance to antibiotics, this systematic review aims to investigate the use and
      efficacy of probiotics when used alone or in conjunction with the current
      guideline treatment. A literature search was conducted using Pubmed, MEDLINE, and
      Cochrane for peer-reviewed articles published between January 1, 2016 and April
      2022. MeSH terms used were: "H. pylori," "H. pylori and probiotics,"
      "Probiotics," "H. pylori treatment," "Mechanism of Action" with subheadings as
      "clinical manifestations," "treatment," and "diagnosis." All literature reviews, 
      original papers, and case reports were included. This search strategy aimed to
      find literature that could describe the transmission and mechanism of action of
      H. pylori, the current treatment guidelines, and the efficacy of probiotics in
      eradicating H. pylori.

LID - 10.1039/d2md00049k [doi]
AB  - By 2050, it is predicted that antimicrobial resistance will be responsible for 10
      million global deaths annually, more deaths than cancer, costing the world
      economy $100 trillion. Clearly, strategies to address this problem are essential 
      as bacterial evolution is rendering our current antibiotics ineffective. The
      discovery of an allosteric binding site on the established antibacterial target
      DNA gyrase offers a new medicinal chemistry strategy. As this site is distinct
      from the fluoroquinolone binding site, resistance is not yet documented. Using in
      silico molecular design methods, we have designed and synthesised a novel series 
      of biphenyl-based inhibitors inspired by a published thiophene-based allosteric
      inhibitor. This series was evaluated in vitro against Escherichia coli DNA gyrase
      and E. coli topoisomerase IV with the most potent compounds exhibiting IC50
      values towards the low micromolar range for DNA gyrase and only approximately
      2-fold less active against topoisomerase IV. The structure-activity relationships
      reported herein suggest insights to further exploit this allosteric site,
      offering a pathway to overcome developing fluoroquinolone resistance.

TI  - Targeting epigenetic modifiers to reprogramme macrophages in non-resolving
      inflammation-driven atherosclerosis.
PG  - oeab022
LID - 10.1093/ehjopen/oeab022 [doi]
AB  - Epigenomic and epigenetic research has been providing several new insights into a
      variety of diseases caused by non-resolving inflammation, including
      cardiovascular diseases. Atherosclerosis (AS) has long been recognized as a
      chronic inflammatory disease of the arterial walls, characterized by local
      persistent and stepwise accelerating inflammation without resolution, also known 
      as uncontrolled inflammation. The pathogenesis of AS is driven primarily by
      highly plastic macrophages via their polarization to pro- or anti-inflammatory
      phenotypes as well as other novel subtypes recently identified by single-cell
      sequencing. Although emerging evidence has indicated the key role of the
      epigenetic machinery in the regulation of macrophage plasticity, the
      investigation of epigenetic alterations and modifiers in AS and related
      inflammation is still in its infancy. An increasing number of the epigenetic
      modifiers (e.g. TET2, DNMT3A, HDAC3, HDAC9, JMJD3, KDM4A) have been identified in
      epigenetic remodelling of macrophages through DNA methylation or histone
      modifications (e.g. methylation, acetylation, and recently lactylation) in
      inflammation. These or many unexplored modifiers function to determine or switch 
      the direction of macrophage polarization via transcriptional reprogramming of
      gene expression and intracellular metabolic rewiring upon microenvironmental
      cues, thereby representing a promising target for anti-inflammatory therapy in
      AS. Here, we review up-to-date findings involving the epigenetic regulation of
      macrophages to shed light on the mechanism of uncontrolled inflammation during AS
      onset and progression. We also discuss current challenges for developing an
      effective and safe anti-AS therapy that targets the epigenetic modifiers and
      propose a potential anti-inflammatory strategy that repolarizes macrophages from 
      pro- to anti-inflammatory phenotypes.

TI  - Outcomes of clinico-radiologically advanced cancer (cT4b) of buccal mucosa: a
      retrospective analysis of 104 patients.
PG  - 1400
LID - 10.3332/ecancer.2022.1400 [doi]
AB  - Although guidelines recommend non-surgical management for cT4b patients, recent
      studies have shown that upfront surgery in carefully selected patients can be
      performed with acceptable long-term survival benefit. In this study, we analysed 
      the survival outcome of curative intent treatment on cT4b patients. Data from 104
      patients who were staged cT4b and underwent upfront surgery for squamous cell
      carcinoma of buccal mucosa were retrospectively analysed. Outcome measures were
      locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRFS), disease-free survival (DFS) and
      overall survival (OS). The study cohort comprised 104 patients who had a median
      age of 52.5 years (range 27-81 years) and included 81 males (77.9%). Thirty-six
      patients had masticator space involvement on final histopathology, designating
      them as pT4b. Contrast enhanced computed tomography scan demonstrated 91.67%
      sensitivity in identifying masticator space involvement, albeit with a lower
      accuracy of 31.7%. Pathologically, clear margins were achieved in 79 (76%)
      patients. 62 (59.7%) and 20 (19.2%) patients received adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) 
      and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy respectively. 2-year LRFS, DFS and OS were 61.8%, 
      60% and 68.1%, respectively. On multivariate analyses, involved margins (hazard
      ratio (HR) 28.766, p = 0.006), pN2b status (HR 4.68, p = 0.027) and perineural
      invasion (PNI) (HR 3.001, p = 0.027) showed statistically significant impact on
      LRFS, involved margins (HR 28.859, p = 0.008) and pN2b status (HR 4.018, p =
      0.004) affected DFS. Involved margins (HR 14.139, p = 0.023) and pN2b status (HR 
      3.166, p = 0.025) showed statistically significant impact on OS. In conclusion,
      upfront surgery is a feasible option for patients with carcinoma of the buccal
      mucosa with the involvement of the masticator space. Survival outcomes are better
      in patients where resection is achieved with clear margins, and regional disease 
      is limited to a single cervical lymph node.

AB  - Introduction: Small cell carcinoma of the oesophagus (SCCE) is a rare and
      aggressive tumour with no established standard treatment. Methods: This is a
      retrospective study of adult patients with histologically proven SCCE registered 
      between February 2011 and March 2020 at Tata Memorial Hospital in Mumbai.
      Results: There were 56 patients, with 29 (51.8%) having limited-stage disease
      (LD) and 27 (48.2%) having extensive-stage disease (ED). The median age was 58
      (interquartile range = 51-65) years; 57.1% were men; and 40% were smokers. Among 
      LD-SCCE patients, 23 underwent local therapy, i.e., radiation (19, 65.5%) and
      surgery (4, 13.8%), and 27 received chemotherapy in neoadjuvant (23, 79.3%),
      concurrent (18, 62.1%) and adjuvant (4, 13.8%) settings. Totally, 19 ED-SCCE
      patients (70.4%) received chemotherapy. Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI)
      was delivered to 11 (37.9%) and 7 (25.9%) patients with LD-SCCE and ED-SCCE,
      respectively. Signi fi cant grade 3 or more chemotoxicities in patients with
      LD-SCCE and ED-SCCE included febrile neutropenia in 33.3% and 23.5%, anaemia in
      9.5% and 17.6%, and dyselectrolytemia in 14.3% and 11.8%, respectively. The
      median overall survival (OS) in LD-SCCE and ED-SCCE was 22.9 (95% CI = 1.8-44.1) 
      months and 11.8 (95% CI = 7.3-16.4) months, respectively. Age <60 years (p =
      0.004) and tumour epicentre in the lower third oesophagus (p = 0.002) were
      independent good prognostic factors for OS in LD-SCCE and ED-SCCE patients,
      respectively. The incidence of brain metastasis was low, at both presentation
      (1/27, 3.7%) and relapse (5/56, 8.9%). Conclusion: Although the survival of
      LD-SCCE is better than ED-SCCE, it is still under 2 years. Brain metastases are
      uncommon and the role of PCI is uncertain.

AB  - Introduction: Recently, contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) has emerged as a
      reliable alternative to breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the
      assessment of pathological response in breast cancer patients. Our study sought
      to determine the diagnostic accuracy of CEM to predict pathological complete
      response (pCR) in patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). Methods:
      We retrieved the medical records of patients who underwent NACT at our
      institution. Using post-surgery pCR, morphological evidence and CEM enhancement
      tumours were classified as follows: 1) radiologic complete response (rCR); 2)
      functional radiological complete response (frCR); and 3) non-complete response.
      Initially, we used multivariate analyses adjusted by clinical variables and frCR 
      or rCR to determine which variables affected pathological response. Then, CEM
      diagnostic accuracy to discriminate pCR was assessed using receiver operating
      characteristic curves in univariate and multivariate models including either frCR
      or rCR. Results: A total of 48 patients were included in our study. Most patients
      (68.7%) were hormone receptor (HR)+ and 41.6% (20) of the patients achieved pCR. 
      Using univariate logistic regression analyses we found that HR status, HER2
      status, rCR and frCR had a significant impact on CEM diagnostic accuracy.
      Exploratory analyses found that CEM sensitivity was higher for HR- tumours.
      Multivariate logistic regression analyses found 60% sensitivity, 92.9%
      specificity and 79.2% accuracy in a model that included clinical variables and
      rCR. Conclusion: CEM is a reliable alternative to high-cost, time-consuming
      breast MRI that predicts pCR in patients undergoing NACT; CEM diagnostic accuracy
      was higher among patients who harboured HR- tumours.

TI  - Information-sharing experiences of professionals looking after children with
      cancer: a qualitative exploration from a specialist paediatric oncology unit in
      India.
PG  - 1399
LID - 10.3332/ecancer.2022.1399 [doi]
AB  - Background: Childhood cancer often involves a long-term engagement of children
      and their parents with health services. During this journey, communications
      between professionals, parents and young people can be stressful for all the
      stakeholders. This study explores the communication preferences in paediatric
      oncology. Objectives: The objective of the present exploratory qualitative study 
      was to understand the views of professionals regarding information exchange
      during cancer treatment of children and complement these findings with
      clinic-based ethnographic observation of real-life consultations. Methods: Using 
      qualitative methods, in-depth interviews were conducted with paediatric oncology 
      professionals. The interviews had been audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim.
      Alongside in-depth interviews, real-life interactions between parents,
      professionals and children were observed. Data were analysed using a thematic
      analysis framework as suggested by Braun and Clark. Results: Paediatric oncology 
      professionals (n = 14) were interviewed from diverse professional backgrounds
      that included consultant paediatric oncologists, junior specialist trainees in
      paediatric oncology, paediatric oncology nurses, social workers, survivor
      counsellor and psychologists looking after children with cancer. Additionally,
      clinic-based ethnographic observations (n = 10) of interactions between
      professionals, parents and young people were also conducted. The following themes
      emerged from the interviews: a) Information needs of children were very different
      from adolescents. Children were more worried about 'here and now'; b) adolescents
      were, on the other hand, mostly worried about the 'impact of cancer on their
      broader life, friendships and academics'; c) parents were curious about the
      outcome, costs and effectiveness of treatment, and different patterns emerged for
      mothers and fathers; d) information needs were dynamic and different at the start
      of the treatment, during treatment, at remission or end of life; e) the journey
      of the clinicians themselves impacted information-sharing practices; and f)
      direct observation of consultations highlighted the importance of priming parents
      before delivery of information, having multiple family members during the
      conversation and managing intense emotions expressed during the session.
      Conclusion: Paediatric oncology professionals need to be sensitive about the
      dynamic nature of information needs while interacting with children and parents
      of children with cancer. The above findings may help tailor the discussions that 
      professionals ought to have with families with a child with cancer. The results
      may contribute to the understanding as well as to developing training courses on 
      communications in paediatric oncology for low- and middle-income countries.

AB  - There are no reports on chemotherapy treatment in patients with ovarian germ cell
      tumours and kidney failure. We report the case of a 29-year-old female diagnosed 
      with an advanced right ovarian germ cell tumour and severe kidney damage treated 
      with haemodialysis. The first cycle of chemotherapy was administered with 10
      mg/m2 of cisplatin on days 1, 3, and 5, and 35 mg/m2 of etoposide from day 1
      through 5, followed by haemodialysis 1 hour after the end of cisplatin infusion
      on days 1, 3, and 5, with grade 3 haematologic toxicity. After the first cycle,
      kidney function improved and haemodialysis was suspended. From the second cycle
      onwards, the dose was increased to 80% cisplatin and 100% etoposide with grade 3 
      haematologic toxicity; following that, the dose of etoposide was decreased to 80%
      in cycle 3. In the face of tumour progression, the regimen was changed to a
      standard dose of ifosfamide on days 1 through 5, and carboplatin on day 1
      calculated at the area under the plasma concentration curve of free carboplatin
      versus time of 5 mg/ml/minute. An 80% dosage of ifosfamide and cisplatin was used
      from the second to fourth cycle, achieving partial response by imaging. The
      patient was taken to surgery and there was no histopathological evidence of
      viable cancer cells. In conclusion, cisplatin-based chemotherapy can be
      administered to a patient with advanced ovarian germ cell tumour and renal
      insufficiency at lower doses to prevent side effects while retaining efficacy in 
      a multidisciplinary treatment setting.

AB  - Introduction: Limited data exists for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients
      harbouring de novo T790M mutation. Methods: NSCLC patients, with de novo T790M,
      who registered at our institute between 01/03/2015 and 31/12/2019, were
      considered for retrospective analysis of treatment pattern and clinical outcomes,
      i.e., progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Results: Of
      1,542 epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated patients, 40 (2.59%) had de
      novo T790M. Most were male (27, 67.5%) and smokers (23, 57.5%). The commonest
      site of metastasis was the lungs (31, 77.5%), while 7 (17.5%) had central nervous
      system (CNS) involvement. Additional EGFR gene mutations and anaplastic lymphoma 
      kinase (ALK) positivity were observed in 20 (50.0%) and 4 (10.0%) cases,
      respectively. The first-line systemic therapy and the number of patients
      receiving it were as follows: osimertinib by 14 (35.0%), first-generation EGFR
      tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) by 10 (25.0%), gefitinib + chemotherapy by 3
      (7.5%), chemotherapy by 7 (17.5%) and gefitinib + bevacizumab by 2 (5%). One
      patient defaulted before starting any treatment. Hence, 39 were considered for
      survival analysis. The median PFS and OS for the entire cohort were 10.4 (95% CI 
      = 7.6-19.7) months and 24.9 (95% CI = 15.7-NA) months, respectively. The median
      PFS for patients on osimertinib was 19.8 (95% CI = 11.6-28.0) months versus 8.8
      (95% CI = 6.6-10.9) months for those on other systemic therapy. No CNS
      involvement, use of osimertinib or first-generation EGFR TKI plus chemotherapy or
      ALK inhibitor in ALK-positive cases prognosticated better PFS. When compared to
      other systemic therapies, osimertinib improved PFS in patients with or without
      additional EGFR mutations, although it was statistically significant for the
      former group only (p = 0.002). Conclusion: The incidence of de novo T790M is low.
      Osimertinib in frontline therapy provides promising outcomes.

AB  - Introduction: Glioblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumour in adults.
      Among all gliomas, it is the most aggressive type, with a high fatality rate, and
      according to the WHO classification, it is a grade IV tumour. As this tumour is
      well-known for its poor survival, an understanding of clinical and
      treatment-related prognostic factors can help in tailored treatment. The aim of
      this study was to know the impact of prognostic factors on survival in these
      cases. Materials and methods: All glioblastoma patients treated in our hospital
      during 2010-2015 were included in the analysis. Cases were divided into different
      groups based on prognostic factors. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free
      survival (DFS) were calculated and compared among the different groups.
      Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS software v20. Results: One-year
      OS was 36.9% and 2-year OS was 10.8%. One-year DFS was 13.04%. On univariate
      analysis, age at presentation </=45 years and adjuvant chemotherapy with six
      cycles or more temozolomide improved OS and DFS. Multivariate analysis retained
      the statistically significant positive impact of usage of adjuvant temozolomide
      chemotherapy of >/=six cycles on OS and DFS. The use of the anti-epileptic drug
      Levetiracetam had a statistically significant improvement of DFS. Conclusion:
      Among various clinical and treatment-related prognostic factors evaluated in our 
      study, younger age at presentation and addition of temozolomide chemotherapy to
      radiation showed improvement in OS and DFS. The use of the anti-epileptic drug
      Levetiracetam had an impact on DFS in glioblastoma patients.

TI  - Determinants of sexual function among survivors of gynaecological cancers in a
      tertiary hospital: a cross-sectional study.
PG  - 1384
LID - 10.3332/ecancer.2022.1384 [doi]
AB  - Background: Gynaecological cancer impacts approximately three million women
      globally. The problem is much more intense in resource-limited countries. Sexual 
      health is a critical aspect of gynaecological cancer treatment and an important
      component of quality of life (QoL). Aims: This study aimed to assess the
      determinants of sexual function among survivors of gynaecological cancer. Method:
      This was a cross-sectional study. The simple random sampling technique was used
      to recruit survivors of gynaecological cancers aged 18 years and above on
      follow-up in a tertiary hospital in Kenya. Tools: The study used the
      socio-demographic survey, Body Image Scale, Multidimensional Perceived Social
      Support Scale and Female Sexual Function Index. Results: Cervical cancer was the 
      most common gynaecological malignancy among respondents (51%). The mean total
      score of the Female Sexual Function Index was significantly low at 10.0 (cut off 
      = 26.5). The majority (85%) of respondents had sexual dysfunction. The most
      commonly affected sexual domain was lubrication at a mean value of 0.91 (SD =
      1.58). Age (aOR = 0.05, 95% CI: 0.003-0.16, p = 0.005), cancer stage 3 (aOR =
      9.81, 95% CI: 1.34-20.56, p = 0.035) and social support (aOR = 1.29, 95% CI:
      1.05-1.59, p = 0.015) were independent predictors of sexual dysfunction.
      Conclusion: The prevalence of sexual dysfunction among gynaecological cancer
      survivors remains significantly high. Having cervical cancer was the most
      significant predictor of sexual dysfunction in this study population.
      Recommendation: There is a need for further studies to improve the sexual life
      and hence the QoL among survivors of gynaecological malignancies.

TI  - A public policy analysis with key stakeholders' insights to understand India's
      compliance with the WHO framework convention on tobacco control.
PG  - 1402
LID - 10.3332/ecancer.2022.1402 [doi]
AB  - Background: Tobacco-related morbidity and mortality is a global public health
      challenge. India is the second largest consumer of tobacco in the world. The
      present paper synthesises the data from qualitative interviews of experts working
      in the field of tobacco control alongside a critical analysis of the national
      tobacco control policy of India. Methods: The research methods adopted for the
      present work included the following: 1) qualitative in-depth interview of experts
      and analysis of the qualitative data using thematic analysis; 2) searching
      existing literature and secondary data on the national tobacco policy and
      analysing the same using the methodological orientation of qualitative content
      analysis; and 3) health policy analysis of the national tobacco policy. Themes
      and sub-themes obtained from the two approaches were compared to generate
      meaning. Results: Nine experts (three women and six men) participated in the
      in-depth qualitative interviews from a variety of professional backgrounds
      (preventive oncology researcher, tobacco cessation specialist, public health
      expert, clinicians and human rights activists). The systematic and comprehensive 
      literature search resulted in finding 14 research papers, reviews, policy
      documents and commentaries on the tobacco epidemic in India. The various themes
      that emerged from the qualitative interviews that found support from secondary
      data as well were: 'Conflicting policies of Government: Promoting tobacco
      production and at the same time restricting its use', 'Failure to shield from
      influence of tobacco industry', 'Demand reduction proposals through taxation and 
      pricing', 'Legislation to protect from and reduce the harm of second-hand
      smoking', 'Health warning on packaging and labelling of tobacco products',
      'Promotion and advertisement of tobacco products', 'Prohibiting production by and
      sale to minors'. Discussion: The control of a tobacco epidemic has multiple
      structural and functional challenges embedded in the complexity of the
      public-private interfaces, socio-economic forces, conflicting interests of the
      stakeholders and diverse nature of the problem. Any intervention planned to
      reduce the tobacco usage at a population level needs to take these factors into
      consideration.

TI  - A hierarchical approach to combine histological grade and immunohistochemical
      factors to identify high-risk luminal breast cancers.
PG  - 1382
LID - 10.3332/ecancer.2022.1382 [doi]
AB  - Background: The luminal subtype accounts for ~70% of newly diagnosed breast
      cancer patients. Although it has a better prognosis, approximately 30% of them
      develop a late relapse. Identifying those patients is of interest to improve
      treatment decisions. Methods: A retrospective observational, single-centre study 
      based on data from medical records of 572 non-metastatic (I-III) invasive ductal 
      breast carcinoma patients, 448 with luminal tumours and 124 with triple-negative 
      tumours. Kaplan-Meier, Cox regression and time-dependent Cox regression were
      carried out to obtain the prognosis value of risk factors. Results: During a
      median observation of 5.5 years, 105 distant metastasis events and 105 all-cause 
      deaths were observed. In addition to known clinicopathological factors (i.e.,
      age, tumour size and lymph node metastasis), the high semi-quantitative
      expression of both hormone receptors was associated with distant metastasis-free 
      survival (DMFS) (adjusted hazard ratio (HaR): 0.524 (0.316-0.867), p = 0.012) and
      overall survival (OS) (adjusted HaR: 0.486 (0.286-0.827), p = 0.008). The
      stratified analysis made it possible to identify risk modification factors.
      Subsequent stratification by histological grade, Ki-67 and semi-quantitative PR
      expression or, mainly, the composite semi-quantitative expression of hormone
      receptors (cHR) enabled the identification of luminal breast cancer patients of
      adjuvant schema at higher risk for metastasis and death. However, initial
      analyses including patients of neoadjuvant therapy pointed to a path of
      subsequent stratification by cHR and histological grade, also enabling grouping
      of luminal breast cancer patients with similar prognosis for DMFS (cHR </= 4+ G2 
      or G3 versus triple-negative, adjusted HaR: 0.703 (0.415-1.189), p = 0.189) and
      OS (cHR </=4+ G2 or G3 versus triple-negative, adjusted HaR: 0.662 (0.403-1.088),
      p = 0.104). Conclusion: The semi-quantitative expression of both cHR, Ki-67
      proliferation index and histological grade can identify luminal breast cancer
      patients at greater risk of developing metastasis and death when combined in a
      hierarchical fashion, and could be useful for a better prognosis stratification
      in services from low- and middle-income countries.

AB  - A 68-year-old man, without a family history of cancer, was treated for primary
      cutaneous melanoma of the scalp. Two years later, a right lateral cervical lymph 
      recurrence was observed and he was treated with lymphadenectomy and adjuvant
      nivolumab for 1 year. Four years from the initial melanoma diagnosis, a computer 
      tomography scan showed a solid nodular lesion of 26 x 40 x 75 mm inside the
      previously known inguinoscrotal hernia. A new recurrence of melanoma was the most
      probable diagnosis and a right inguinal hernioplasty was performed. Notably, the 
      histopathological examination revealed a mesenteric fibromatosis with the typical
      immunohistochemical pattern (strong nuclear staining of beta-catenin).
      Interestingly, this represents the first case of a patient with a mesenteric
      desmoid tumour presenting as an inguinal hernia masking a cutaneous melanoma
      recurrence.

TI  - Adjuvant chemotherapy after curative D2 gastrectomy in Latin American patients
      with gastric cancer.

AB  - Background: Gastric cancer (GC) is the fourth most common cause of cancer deaths 
      around the world and the first cause of cancer deaths in Peru; however, there are
      no prospective trials for adjuvant chemotherapy in GC after curative gastrectomy 
      in this country. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of
      adjuvant chemotherapy in stage II-III gastric cancer patients who underwent D2
      gastrectomy. Methods: We included patients with stage II-III gastric cancer who
      underwent radical gastrectomy and D2 dissection between 2014 and 2016 at our
      institution. Patients received 3-week cycles of capecitabine (1,000 mg/m(2) twice
      daily on days 1-14) plus oxaliplatin (130 mg/m(2) on day 1) for 6 months.
      Survival curves were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method, and the Cox
      proportional hazards model was used to identify prognostic factors for survival. 
      Results: In total, 173 patients were included: 100 (57.8%) patients received
      adjuvant chemotherapy and surgery (AChS) and 73 (42.2%) surgery alone (SA).
      Three-year disease-free survival (DFS) was higher in the AChS groups (69%) than
      in the SA group (52.6%) (p = 0.034). Regarding overall survival (OS), 31 patients
      (31%) died in the AChS group compared with 34 (46.6%) in the SA group (p =
      0.027). In the multivariate analysis, adjuvant chemotherapy was an independent
      prognostic factor for DFS (HR = 0.60; 95% CI = 0.37-0.97; p = 0.036) and OS (HR =
      0.58; 95% CI = 0.36-0.95; p = 0.029). ACh showed consistent benefit in DFS and OS
      for patients with albumin >3.5 g/dL, lymphovascular and perineural invasion, pT4,
      pN2-3, pathologic stage (PS) IIIA and IIIB and lymph node ratio (LNR) > 13.1.
      Conclusion: These data suggest that adjuvant capecitabine and oxaliplatin reduce 
      the recurrence and mortality in patients with stage II-III gastric cancer who
      underwent D2 gastrectomy. PS IIIA and IIIB and LNR > 13.1 benefited more from
      receiving adjuvant chemotherapy and poorly cohesive gastric carcinoma did not
      significantly reduce the rates of survival.

AB  - Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC) is an autosomal
      dominant syndrome associated with fumarate hydratase (FH) gene mutation leading
      to defective DNA double-strand break repair mechanism. Although these tumours
      have an aggressive presentation, they respond well to targeted therapy with fewer
      adverse effects. Here we present a case of a 42-year-old female having isolated
      renal cell carcinoma, papillary type 2, carrying a mutation in the FH gene
      without cutaneous and uterine involvement. Her tumour responded well to erlotinib
      and bevacizumab combination and she was on treatment for 23 months. This report
      adds to the current literature and can help to define treatment protocols for
      HLRCC.

      with cancer.
PG  - 1388
LID - 10.3332/ecancer.2022.1388 [doi]
AB  - Background: Cancer in young women is a major health problem in the Middle Eastern
      and North African population. We explored the awareness, barriers and practice of
      Arab oncologists towards oncofertility. Methods: Oncologists from Arab countries 
      treating female cancer patients were invited to complete a 30-item web-based
      questionnaire that explores oncologists' demographics, available techniques and
      barriers to oncofertility. Results: 170 oncologists working in 9 different Arab
      countries responded to the questionnaire. Among the responders, 89 (52.4%) were
      from Egypt and the central region, 60 (35.3%) were from North Africa and 21
      (12.4%) were from the Gulf region.While most participants considered a dedicated 
      training 'necessary', only 43 oncologists (25.3%) received a formal training.
      Only 17 participants (10%) had a fertility clinic in their centre, 44 (25.9%) and
      13 (7.6%) had to refer patients to other centres or other cities, respectively. A
      total of 96 oncologists (56.5%) did not have access to a fertility preservation
      service.Out of 147 responders, 79 (53.7%) offered fertility preservation only in 
      patients presenting with early disease and 38 (25.9%) did not offer fertility
      preservation. In terms of proposed strategies, 50 responders (29.4%) offered
      embryo cryopreservation, 79 (46.5%) oocyte cryopreservation and 48 (28.2%)
      ovarian tissue cryopreservation. Conclusion: A large gap exists between
      international clinical practice guidelines and current practices of fertility
      preservation in Arab countries. Barriers to optimum service delivery include the 
      lack of physician awareness/training, unavailability of some advanced techniques 
      and a lack of dedicated fertility clinics within the cancer centres.

TI  - Cancer vulnerability in an indigenous Himalayan population in Arunachal Pradesh.
PG  - 1405
LID - 10.3332/ecancer.2022.1405 [doi]
AB  - Cancer incidence and its related mortality has been a public health concern for
      Arunachal Pradesh in India. However, there is a lack of evidence about the
      knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) for cancer risk factors, screening
      programmes and preventive behaviour - especially among indigenous tribal
      populations. A cross-sectional survey was conducted using Google Forms from 16
      September 2020 to 2 January 2021 among an indigenous population of Arunachal
      Pradesh. Snowball sampling was used to enrol 565 participants aged >/=18 years
      (264 were male and 301 were female). Univariate and bivariate analyses were
      conducted using SPSS version 23 to test the hypothesis of KAP. (There is no
      difference in the level of knowledge / in the attitude / level of practice among 
      study participants with respect to any independent (socio-demographic and other) 
      factors.) The Papumpare Cancer Registry reported the highest cancer density among
      women and the second highest among men among all population-based cancer
      registries in India (Indian Council of Medical Research, Report of National
      Cancer Registry Programme, Bengaluru, India 2020). Knowledge about the cause of
      cancer and risk factors was poor among 23% of the respondents. Attitude towards
      screening was negative among 14.9%. Practice levels to prevent cancer were also
      low (31%). More than 50% of the cases were treated outside the state and at
      private hospitals. Knowledge about cancer symptoms and risk factors was limited
      in the population. There is a need for more effective health promotional services
      in the state. Mass screening facilities and behavioural change activities are
      required and could be disseminated through social media platforms. Our analysis
      of a north-eastern region of India, which has unique geographical and cultural
      characteristics, informs future policy designs and other related studies for
      controlling cancer in the area.

      in breast cancer patients from a tertiary cancer centre in India.
PG  - 1398
LID - 10.3332/ecancer.2022.1398 [doi]
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has replaced axillary lymph node
      dissection (ALND) for axillary staging in early node-negative breast cancer (BC) 
      patients in developed countries. However, in resource-constrained developing
      countries, adoption of SLNB is slow due to logistic issues and lack of outcome
      data from non-screened BC cohort. Therefore, we aim to report diagnostic
      performance, surgical morbidity and survival outcome of SLNB in BC patients from 
      a tertiary care cancer centre in India. Methodology: 1,521 consecutive early
      node-negative T1-3N0 BC patients having SLNB from 2011 to 2020 were included in
      the study. Data were retrieved from the institutional Redcap database and
      electronic medical records. Analysis was done using Stata14. Results: SLNB was
      done by dual dye (methylene blue (MB) + radioisotope (RI)/indo cyanine green
      (ICG)) in 57.7%, MB only in 39.3%, and RI alone in 3% of patients. The
      identification rate (IR) and SLNB positivity rate were 96% and 27.7%,
      respectively. IR was highest (98%) with MB + ICG and lowest (94%) with MB alone
      SLNB. UltraSonoGraphy guided fine needle aspiration cytology of radiological
      suspicious nodes has significantly reduced the SLNB positivity rate from 34.6% to
      26.4% (p < 0.01). One patient had skin necrosis, and 16 had persistent blue
      staining of the skin in the MB injection site. All were managed conservatively.
      The lymphedema rate was significantly higher (5.2%) in the ALND versus 0.5% in
      the SLNB alone patients (p < 0.05). In a median follow up of 27 months, the
      axillary recurrence rate was 0.04% (4/1,023), and false-negative rate was 0.9% in
      SLNB negative patients. There were 35 recurrences and 25 deaths in SLNB negative 
      patients, with 10 years predicted disease-free survival of 81% (95% CI 66% to
      89%) and overall survival of 79% (95% CI 59% to 90%). Conclusions: SLNB should be
      offered as an axillary staging procedure to all eligible BC patients from
      developing countries to avoid the morbidity associated with ALND. Fluorescent dye
      can be used as an alternative for RI in a resource-constrained setup.

AB  - Background: Radiotherapy is a standard treatment option for early glottic
      carcinoma (stage I and II) with a fraction size of 2-2.2 Gy over 5-7 weeks. This 
      study evaluates the outcome and prognostic factors of a 3-week hypofractionated
      treatment in early glottic malignancy. Materials and Methods: The case records of
      329 eligible patients with stage I and II glottic carcinoma recorded at the
      institution from 2003 to 2008 were retrospectively analysed. All patients were
      treated in a Cobalt-60 machine to a dose of 52.5 Gy in 15 fractions (3.5
      Gy/fraction) over 3 weeks. Results: Eighty-three percent had stage I disease. The
      local control rate at 5 years was 91.9%. On univariate analysis, stage I and II
      patients without subglottic extension had better local control. Disease extension
      to the subglottis fared poorly on multivariate analysis. After salvage treatment,
      the 5-year disease-free survival rate was 96.1% and the functional larynx
      preservation rate was 94.9% for stage I and 83.9% for stage II. The rate of
      severe complications was 2.1%. Conclusion: Comparable results with low morbidity 
      are achievable with a 3-week hypofractionation in early glottic cancers and it
      offers better patient convenience. Highlights: In early glottic cancer,
      hypofractionated radiation provides excellent local control.Subglottic extension 
      is a poor prognostic factor.5-year disease-free survival rate of 96.1%.5-year
      functional larynx preservation rate of 94.9%.Severe complication rate of 2.1%.

PG  - 1390
LID - 10.3332/ecancer.2022.1390 [doi]
AB  - Hand-foot syndrome (HFS), or palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, is characterised 
      by erythema, oedema and dysesthesia, which can progress to blistering and
      ulceration. This condition is described as a common adverse effect of the
      chemotherapeutic agent capecitabine. The study set out to evaluate real-world
      incidences; assess severity based on clinical criteria, such as local symptoms,
      dyschromia, erythema, oedema and ulcerations; and associated factors, such as
      type of solid tumour, chemotherapy regimen, number of cycles, sex, age and
      Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Scale of HFS, related to the use
      of capecitabine. This is a single-centre prospective cohort study carried out
      jointly by the departments of clinical oncology and dermatology of a university
      hospital in the southeast of Brazil. The study showed a 34% incidence of HFS,
      with most cases classified as mild. There was statistical significance in the
      correlation of the syndrome with sex and performance scores. HFS is the most
      common and limiting adverse reaction to capecitabine, and causes significant
      functional and quality impairments in patients with cancer. With this study, we
      have reinforced the importance of multidisciplinary assessment for early
      diagnosis and adequate follow-up.

TI  - Totally implantable venous access ports and associated complications in
      sub-Saharan Africa: a single-centre retrospective analysis.
PG  - 1389
LID - 10.3332/ecancer.2022.1389 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: Although totally implantable venous access ports (TIVAPs) have been safe
      and valuable in the management of cancer and other chronically ill patients who
      require long-term intermittent venous access, a few complications have been
      reported with their use. Data on the use of TIVAPs in sub-Saharan Africa and
      other low- and middle-income regions is limited. In this study, we determine the 
      complications that arise from TIVAP use at a cancer centre in Nigeria. Patients
      and Methods: Between 4 January 2018 and 15 September 2020, 100 patients received 
      TIVAPs at our centre, primarily for the administration of chemotherapy for the
      treatment of solid tumours. Data were retrospectively extracted from the
      institutional electronic medical records and descriptive analysis of patient and 
      disease characteristics, port-specific data and data on complications and
      outcomes was conducted. Results: The 100 patients who were implanted with TIVAPs 
      at our cancer centre had their devices in situ for a total of 27,183 days, with a
      mean duration of use of 272 catheter-days (SD: 267 days; range: 2-952).
      TIVAP-related complications were identified in 13 patients (13%), i.e., an
      incidence of 0.478 complications/1,000 catheter-days. The mean time to onset of
      complications was 61 days (SD: 105 days; median: 23 days; range: 0-389). The
      complications observed include port-site bleeding, pocket infection, cutaneous
      site infection, arterial puncture, wound dehiscence, difficult access (due to
      port malpositioning and port site fibrosis) and others. No deaths, pneumothorax, 
      haemothorax, catheter occlusions, or catheter-associated venous thromboses were
      recorded. Conclusion: Our study shows that TIVAPs can be used successfully in our
      environment and presents a case for more widespread use to improve both the
      patient experience and the ability of healthcare providers to deliver optimal
      treatment.

TI  - Cues to cervical cancer screening and reaction to cervical cancer diagnosis
      during screening among women in Shai Osudoku District, Ghana.
PG  - 1392
LID - 10.3332/ecancer.2022.1392 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Availability and access to cervical cancer screening (CCS) in less 
      developed countries are limited as compared to developed countries. Moreover, the
      rise in cervical cancer fatalities and mortalities is attributed to the low
      patronage in CCS among women. The aim of this study was therefore to explore the 
      cues to cervical cancer screening and perceptions of the reaction to cervical
      cancer diagnosis among women in Shai Osudoku District. Methods: A qualitative
      approach and an exploratory descriptive design were considered by the researcher 
      for this study. Seventeen participants in all were recruited to partake in
      face-to-face in-depth interviews guided by semi-structured interviews. The
      sampling technique employed is purposive and content analysis was used in the
      data analysis. Findings: Two main themes, i.e., cues to cervical cancer screening
      and perception about women's reaction to cervical cancer diagnosis, emerged.
      Health workers, peer influence, spousal influence, creation of awareness and
      reducing cervical cancer screening cost emerged as major determinants (cues) that
      influence women's decision to (not to) screen. Conclusion: The participants of
      this study acknowledged that their decision to (not to) screen was greatly
      influenced by some external factors. Hence, it is recommended that more attention
      be directed towards motivating and encouraging women to partake in cervical
      cancer screening services to help reduce fatalities.

      oral cancer patients.
PG  - 1401
LID - 10.3332/ecancer.2022.1401 [doi]
AB  - Background: Head and neck cancers (HNCs) are one of the commonest cancers in low-
      and middle-income countries. There is a paucity of data on comorbid psychiatric
      problems associated with HNCs. The present study is aimed at reporting the
      pattern of psychiatric caseness in HNC patients who were referred to specialist
      psycho-oncology service and also investigate the predictors of psychiatric
      caseness in oral cancer patients. Methods: Case records of all patients with HNC 
      referred to an integrated psycho-oncology service over 7 years (October
      2011-December 2018) from a cancer hospital were analysed. All patients were
      assessed by a trained consultant psychiatrist and ICD-10 diagnoses were
      ascertained based on a clinical interview with the patients and family members.
      Associations of psychiatric caseness for consecutive oral cancer patients
      assessed by the psycho-oncology services over 2 years (January 2017-December
      2018) were calculated by using univariate and multivariate statistical methods.
      Simple descriptive statistics of the referred patients were conducted, followed
      by logistic regression to find the associations of psychiatric caseness in oral
      cancer patients. Results: The psycho-oncology service assessed 771 HNC patients
      over 7 years. The commonest referrals were patients with oral cancer (75%,
      558/771). For the years 2017-2018, 179 consecutive oral cancer patients were
      evaluated by the psycho-oncology service. Multivariate logistic regression
      analysis showed that being a woman (OR = 2.33; 95% CI = 1.02-5.32; p = 0.04);
      having worries about having pain in the post-operative period (OR = 2.55; 95% CI 
      = 1.2-5.38; p = 0.01); worries about implications of the cancer and its treatment
      on the family (OR = 3.5; 95% CI = 1.19-10.57; p = 0.02); and longer duration of
      hospital stay period (OR = 1.08; 95% CI = 1.003-1.16; p = 0.04) were
      independently associated with psychiatric caseness even after controlling for
      confounders. Discussion: Specialist psycho-oncology services are important in the
      management of oral cancer patients and in addressing the mental health needs of
      this very vulnerable group of patients. A combination of psychoeducation,
      pragmatic psychological interventions and medications were used to treat these
      patients.

AB  - Introduction: Adrenal glands are a common site of metastasis for several types of
      malignancies. Nevertheless, bilateral metastasis leading to adrenal insufficiency
      is a very rare presentation. Presentation of case: We present a 62-year-old woman
      with previous history of colorectal cancer and bilateral adrenal metastasis
      associated with primary adrenal insufficiency. The patient underwent bilateral
      open adrenalectomy after a multidisciplinary tumour board evaluation. Conclusion:
      The incidence of adrenal insufficiency may be underestimated in patients with a
      history of cancer. Adrenal function must be evaluated in those patients
      presenting with bilateral adrenal masses and hormonal replacement therapy should 
      be considered, if appropriate. In selected cases, bilateral adrenalectomy can
      give a possible therapeutic option for patients with confined disease to the
      adrenal glands.

TI  - An Unusual Case of Giant Cell Arteritis.
PG  - e26483
LID - 10.7759/cureus.26483 [doi]
AB  - Giant cell arteritis (GCA), also known as temporal arteritis (TA), is a systemic 
      autoimmune inflammation of medium and large arteries. It is the most common
      vasculitis affecting adults older than 50, with an incidence of 20/100,000 and an
      average age of onset of 70. Typically, patients initially present with new-onset 
      headaches, visual changes and disturbances, jaw claudication, arthralgias, and
      tender or swollen temporal or occipital arteries. Our patient is a 73-year-old
      male who presented to the emergency room with 10 days of bilateral headache
      radiating to the occipital area associated with fevers, persistent chills,
      generalized weakness, and a headache described as constant, dull, 9 out of 10
      pain, and minor pain with neck flexion. Lab work revealed an elevated erythrocyte
      sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). The patient had tender
      palpation to his temples and due to a high suspicion of giant cell arteritis, he 
      was started on high-dose steroids with rapid relief of his symptoms. Biopsy
      showed evidence of active non-granulomatous vasculitis and confirmed bilateral
      temporal arteritis within the context of the clinical setting. GCA patients are
      more likely to be women and typically present with unilateral headache (66% of
      GCA), jaw claudication (50%), fevers (50%), and transient visual loss (16-54%).
      Here, we describe a 73-year-old male with a past medical history of cerebral
      vascular accident (CVA), diabetes, and cancer that presented with 10 days of
      bilateral headaches and fevers. Unlike the usual presentation, our patient denied
      any vision and joint pain changes, and the temporal arteries were not stiff to
      palpation. This patient presentation is unique to previous reports in the limited
      display of symptoms and absence of the most commonly associated manifestations.
      Although his presentation supported GCA, the features of elevated ESR and CRP,
      headache, and fever were too general to diagnose GCA exclusively, and his
      additional symptoms of rhinorrhea and sinus pain more likely supported infection.
      Our case indicates the importance of maintaining a high index of clinical
      suspicion for GCA in the elderly population presenting with headaches and
      elevated ESR and CRP. GCA, also known as temporal arteritis (TA), is a systemic
      autoimmune inflammation of medium and large arteries. Typically, patients
      initially present with new-onset headaches, visual changes and disturbances, jaw 
      claudication, arthralgias, and tender or swollen temporal or occipital arteries. 
      Diagnosis requires high clinical suspicion, and treatment revolves around high
      doses of steroids.

TI  - Immune checkpoint inhibitors for solid organ transplant recipients: clinical
      updates.
PG  - 82-98
LID - 10.4285/kjt.22.0013 [doi]
AB  - Transplant care continues to advance with increasing clinical experience and
      improvements in immunosuppressive therapy. As the population ages and long-term
      survival improves, transplant patient care has become more complex due to
      comorbidities, frailty, and the increased prevalence of cancer
      posttransplantation. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have become a standard
      treatment option for many cancers in non-transplant patients, but the use of ICIs
      in transplant patients is challenging due to the possibility of disrupting immune
      tolerance. However, over the past few years, ICIs have gradually started to be
      used in transplant patients as well. In this study, we review the current use of 
      ICIs after all solid organ transplantation procedures (kidney, liver, heart, and 
      lung). Increasing data suggest that the type and number of immunosuppressants may
      affect the risk of rejection after immunotherapy. Immunotherapy for cancer in
      transplant patients may be a feasible option for selected patients; however,
      prospective trials in specific organ transplant recipients are needed.

      chromatography ion trap mass spectrometry.
PG  - 20991-21003
LID - 10.1039/d2ra02848d [doi]
AB  - Zorifertinib (AZD-3759; ZFB) is a potent, novel, oral, small molecule used for
      the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). ZFB is Epidermal Growth
      Factor Receptor (EGFR) inhibitor that is characterized by good permeability of
      the blood-brain barrier for (NSCLC) patients with EGFR mutations. The present
      research reports the profiling of in vitro, in vivo and reactive metabolites of
      ZFB. Prediction of vulnerable metabolic sites and reactivity pathways (cyanide
      and GSH) of ZFB were performed by WhichP450 module (StarDrop software package)
      and XenoSite reactivity model (XenoSite Web Predictor-Home), respectively. ZFB in
      vitro metabolites were done by incubation with isolated perfused rat liver
      hepatocytes and rat liver microsomes (RLMs). Extraction of ZFB and its related
      metabolites from the incubation matrix was done by protein precipitation. In vivo
      metabolism was performed by giving ZFB (10 mg kg(-1)) through oral gavage to
      Sprague Dawley rats that were housed in metabolic cages. Urine was collected at
      specific time intervals (0, 6, 12, 18, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 h) from ZFB dosing.
      The collected urine samples were filtered then stored at -70 degrees C. N-Methyl 
      piperazine ring of ZFB undergoes phase I metabolism forming iminium intermediates
      that were stabilized using potassium cyanide as a trapping agent. Incubation of
      ZFB with RLMs were performed in the presence of 1.0 mM KCN and 1.0 mM glutathione
      to check reactive intermediates as it is may be responsible for toxicities
      associated with ZFB usage. For in vitro metabolites there were six in vitro phase
      I metabolites, three in vitro phase II metabolites, seven reactive intermediates 
      (four GSH conjugates and three cyano adducts) of ZFB were detected by LC-IT-MS.
      For in vivo metabolites there were six in vivo phase I and three in vivo phase II
      metabolites of ZFB were detected by LC-IT-MS. In vitro and in vivo phase I
      metabolic pathways were N-demethylation, O-demethylation, hydroxylation,
      reduction, defluorination and dechlorination. In vivo phase II metabolic reaction
      was direct sulphate and glucuronic acid conjugation with ZFB.

      route to possible antitumor agents.
PG  - 20649-20655
LID - 10.1039/d2ra03717c [doi]
AB  - A new oxidant, containing m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (MCPBA) and an iron salt,
      was developed and used for oxidation of steroidal phenols to a quinol/epoxyquinol
      mixture. Reaction was optimized for estrone, by varying initiators (Fe-salts),
      reaction temperature, time and mode of MCPBA application. A series of five more
      substrates (17beta-estradiol and its hydrophobized derivatives) was subjected to 
      the optimized oxidation, providing corresponding p-quinols and
      4beta,5beta-epoxyquinols in good to moderate yields. The obtained epoxyquinols
      were additionally transformed by oxidation, as well as the acid-catalyzed oxirane
      opening. In a preliminary study of the antiproliferative activity against human
      cancer cell lines, all newly synthesized compounds expressed moderate to high
      activity.

TI  - Pulmonary artery capacitance and pulmonary vascular resistance as prognostic
      indicators in acute pulmonary embolism.
PG  - oeac007
LID - 10.1093/ehjopen/oeac007 [doi]
AB  - Aims: The non-invasive calculation of right ventricular (RV) haemodynamics as
      pulmonary artery (PA) capacitance (PAC) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR)
      have proved to be feasible, easy to perform, and of high prognostic value. We,
      therefore, evaluated whether baseline PAC and PVR could predict clinical outcomes
      for patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Methods and results: We
      prospectively followed 373 patients [mean (standard deviation) age, 64.1 (14.9)
      years; 58.4% were men, and 27.9% had cancer] who had acute PE and transthoracic
      echocardiography within 1 day of diagnosis from 1 March 2013 through 30 June
      2020. Pulmonary artery capacitance was calculated as left ventricular stroke
      volume/(PA systolic pressure - PA diastolic pressure). Pulmonary vascular
      resistance was calculated as (tricuspid regurgitant velocity/RV outflow tract
      velocity time integral) x 10 + 0.16. These two variables were calculated
      retrospectively from the values obtained with transthoracic echocardiography.
      Pulmonary artery capacitance was acquired in 99 (27%) patients and PVR in 65
      (17%) patients. Univariable and bivariable logistic regression analyses, and
      receiver operating characteristic curves were used to evaluate the ability of
      these haemodynamic measurements to predict mortality up to 6 months. After using 
      bivariable models to adjust individually for age, cancer, and pulmonary
      hypertension. Pulmonary vascular resistance was associated with all-cause
      mortality at 3 months [area under the curve (AUC) 0.75, 95% confidence interval
      (CI) 0.61-0.86; P = 0.01], and 6 months (AUC 0.81; 95% CI 0.69-0.91; P </= 0.03).
      Pulmonary artery capacitance was associated with all-cause mortality at 30 days
      (AUC 0.95; 95% CI 0.82-0.99; P < 0.001) and 3 months (AUC 0.84; 95% CI 0.65-0.99;
      P = 0.003). Conclusion: Non-invasive measurement of RV haemodynamics could
      provide prognostic information of patients with acute PE. Pulmonary artery
      capacitance and PVR are potentially important predictors of all-cause mortality
      in these patients and should be explored in future studies.

TI  - Takotsubo syndrome and respiratory diseases: a systematic review.
PG  - oeac009
LID - 10.1093/ehjopen/oeac009 [doi]
AB  - Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is a rare cardiovascular condition characterized by
      reversible ventricular dysfunction and a presentation resembling that of acute
      myocardial infarction. An increasing number of studies has shown the association 
      of respiratory diseases with TTS. Here, we comprehensively reviewed the
      literature and examined the available evidence for this association. After
      searching PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases, two investigators
      independently reviewed 3117 studies published through May 2021. Of these studies,
      99 met the inclusion criteria (n = 108 patients). In patients with coexisting
      respiratory disease and TTS, the most common TTS symptom was dyspnoea (70.48%),
      followed by chest pain (24.76%) and syncope (2.86%). The most common type of TTS 
      was apical, accounting for 81.13% of cases, followed by the midventricular
      (8.49%), basal (8.49%), and biventricular (1.89%) types. Among the TTS cases,
      39.82% were associated with obstructive lung disease and 38.89% were associated
      with pneumonia. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has been increasingly 
      reported in patients with TTS, was identified in 29 of 42 (69.05%) patients with 
      pneumonia. The overall mortality rate for patients admitted for respiratory
      disease complicated by TTS was 12.50%. Obstructive lung disease and pneumonia are
      the most frequently identified respiratory triggers of TTS. Medications and
      invasive procedures utilized in managing respiratory diseases may also contribute
      to the development of TTS. Furthermore, the diagnosis of TTS triggered by these
      conditions can be challenging due to its atypical presentation. Future
      prospective studies are needed to establish appropriate guidelines for managing
      respiratory disease with concurrent TTS.

AB  - Utilization of robotic surgical systems has increased over the years. Robotic
      surgery is presumed to have advantages of enhanced visualization, improved
      dexterity, and reduced tremor, which is purported to be more suitable for rectal 
      cancer surgery in a confined space than laparoscopic or open surgery. However,
      evidence supporting improved clinical and oncologic outcomes after robotic
      surgery remains controversial and limited despite the widespread adoption of
      robotic surgical systems. To date, numerous observational studies and a few
      randomized controlled trials have failed to demonstrate that short-term,
      oncological, and functional outcomes after a robotic surgery are superior to
      those of laparoscopic surgery for low rectal cancer patients. The objective of
      this review is to summarize the current state of robotic surgery and its impact
      on low-lying rectal cancer.

TI  - Postoperative quality of life after gastrectomy in gastric cancer patients: a
      prospective longitudinal observation study.
PG  - 19-31
LID - 10.4174/astr.2022.103.1.19 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality
      of life (QOL) questionnaires (QLQ-C30, QLQ-OG25, and QLQ-STO22) are widely used
      for the assessment of gastric cancer patients. This study aimed to use these
      questionnaires to evaluate QOL in postgastrectomy patients. Methods: We
      prospectively evaluated 106 patients with distal gastrectomy (DG), 57 with
      pylorus-preserving gastrectomy (PPG), and 117 with total gastrectomy (TG). Body
      weight and QOL questionnaires were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively
      (at 3 weeks, and 3, 6, and 12 months). Results: TG patients had significantly
      more weight loss than DG/PPG patients. Compared with DG, patients after PPG had
      less dyspnea (P = 0.008) and trouble with coughing (P = 0.049), but more severe
      symptoms of insomnia (P = 0.037) and reflux (P = 0.030) at postoperative 12
      months. Compared with DG/PPG, TG was associated with worse body image, dysphagia,
      eating, and taste in both OG25 and STO22. Moreover, OG25 revealed worse QOL in
      the TG group with respect to odynophagia, eating with others, choked when
      swallowing, trouble talking, and weight loss. The QOL of patients who received
      chemotherapy was worse than those in the chemo-free group in both physical
      functioning and symptoms such as nausea/vomiting, appetite loss, and trouble with
      taste; however, these side effects would soon disappear after finishing
      chemotherapy. Conclusion: PPG was similar to DG in terms of postoperative QOL and
      maintaining body weight, while TG was always inferior to both DG and PPG.
      Adjuvant chemotherapy can affect both body weight and QOL despite being
      reversible.

TI  - Predicting stage ypT0-1N0 for nonradical management in patients with middle or

      cohort study.
PG  - 32-39
LID - 10.4174/astr.2022.103.1.32 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: It is important to discover predictive factors that can identify rectal 
      cancer patients who will respond well to neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy
      (CCRT) to develop management strategies, preserve sphincter and avoid
      over-treatment. This study explored clinical factors that would predict the
      adequacy of nonradical management after CCRT in patients with middle or low
      rectal cancer. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 447 patients with middle or 
      low rectal cancer who were treated with curative surgery after neoadjuvant CCRT
      between January 2010 and December 2019. The good response group comprised
      patients with stages ypT0-1N0 on resection after CCRT; the remaining patients
      were included in the poor response group. Results: Of 447 patients (mean age,
      60.37 +/- 11.85 years), 108 (24.2%) had ypT0-1N0 (71.3% with ypT0N0, 4.6% with
      ypTisN0, and 24.1% with ypT1N0). Overall, 19 patients with cT1-2 (50.0% vs. 21.8%
      with cT3-4, P < 0.001), 22 with well-differentiated tumors (51.2% vs. 21.3% with 
      moderately/poorly differentiated tumors, P < 0.001), 16 with fungating tumors
      (47.1% vs. 22.3% with other types, P = 0.001), and 66 with anterior/posterior
      circumference direction (28.9% vs. 19.2% with lateral/encircling direction, P =
      0.016) had stage ypT0-1N0. On multivariable analysis, cT1-2 (P = 0.021) and
      well-differentiated tumor (P = 0.001) were independent predictors of ypT0-1N0.
      Fungating tumors were not significantly associated with ypT0-1N0 (P = 0.054).
      Conclusion: Stage cT1-2 and well differentiation are predictors of ypT0-1N0,
      while fungating tumors could be considered clinically meaningful, possibly
      identifying candidates for nonradical treatment post-CCRT.

TI  - Heart failure and dementia: a comparative analysis with different types of
      cancer.
PG  - oeab003
LID - 10.1093/ehjopen/oeab003 [doi]
AB  - Aims: The prognosis and quality of life of patients with heart failure (HF) is
      determined by comorbidities, with dementia/cognitive decline believed to have a
      significant impact in this regard. This study compares the incidence of dementia 
      in patients with HF with that in patients with common cancers in a large
      collective of outpatients. Methods and results: This retrospective cohort study
      assessed the incidence of dementia/cognitive decline [International
      Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10): I50] in a cohort of patients 
      >/=65 years diagnosed with HF (ICD-10: I50), breast cancer (ICD-10: C50),
      prostate cancer (ICD-10: C61), or digestive organ cancer (ICD-10: C15-C26) in
      1274 German general practices between January 2000 and December 2018.
      Multivariable Cox regression models were used to study the association between HF
      and dementia compared to each of three cancer cohorts. We included 72 259
      patients with HF, 10 310 patients with breast cancer, 12 477 patients with
      prostate cancer, and 12 136 patients with digestive organ cancer. A total of
      27.8% of patients with HF were diagnosed with dementia during the 10-year
      observation period compared to 16.2% of patients with breast cancer, 18.6% of
      patients with digestive organ cancer, and 16.1% of patients with prostate cancer.
      Patients with HF were significantly more likely to develop dementia within 10
      years after diagnosis than patients with breast cancer [hazard ratio (HR): 1.36
      (95% confidence interval 1.28-1.45, P < 0.001], prostate cancer [HR 1.38
      (1.130-1.47), P < 0.001], or gastrointestinal tumours [HR 1.31 (1.24-1.39), P <
      0.001]. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the significance of dementia in
      patients with HF, in whom the condition is much more prevalent than in patients
      with cancer.

      Narrative Review.
PG  - 300-313
LID - 10.30476/IJMS.2021.88511.1927 [doi]
AB  - Venomous arthropods such as scorpions and bees form one of the important groups
      with an essential role in medical entomology. Their venom possesses a mixture of 
      diverse compounds, such as peptides, some of which have toxic effects, and
      enzymatic peptide Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) with a pharmacological potential in the
      treatment of a wide range of diseases. Bee and scorpion venom PLA2 group III has 
      been used in immunotherapy, the treatment of neurodegenerative and inflammatory
      diseases. They were assessed for antinociceptive, wound healing, anti-cancer,
      anti-viral, anti-bacterial, anti-parasitic, and anti-angiogenesis effects. PLA2
      has been identified in different species of scorpions and bees. The
      anti-leishmania, anti-bacterial, anti-viral, and anti-malarial activities of
      scorpion PLA2 still need further investigation. Many pieces of research have been
      stopped in the laboratory stage, and several studies need vast investigation in
      the clinical phase to show the pharmacological potential of PLA2. In this review,
      the medical significance of PLA2 from the venom of two arthropods, namely bees
      and scorpions, is discussed.

TI  - AAMP is a binding partner of costimulatory human B7-H3.
PG  - vdac098
LID - 10.1093/noajnl/vdac098 [doi]
AB  - Background: Targeted immunotherapies are of growing interest in the treatment of 
      various cancers. B7 homolog 3 protein (B7-H3), a member of the
      co-stimulatory/-inhibitory B7-family, exerts immunosuppressive and
      pro-tumorigenic functions in various cancer types and is under evaluation in
      ongoing clinical trials. Unfortunately, interaction partner(s) remain unknown
      which restricts the druggability. Methods: Aiming to identify potential binding
      partner(s) of B7-H3, a yeast two-hybrid and a mass spectrometry screen were
      performed. Potential candidates were evaluated by bimolecular fluorescence
      complementation (BiFC) assay, co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP), and functionally in
      a (3)H-thymidine proliferation assay of Jurkat cells, a T-cell lineage cell line.
      Prognostic value of angio-associated migratory cell protein (AAMP) and B7-H3
      expression was evaluated in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 wildtype (IDH1wt)
      glioblastoma (GBM) patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-GBM cohort.
      Results: Of the screening candidates, CD164, AAMP, PTPRA, and SLAMF7 could be
      substantiated via BiFC. AAMP binding could be further confirmed via co-IP and on 
      a functional level. AAMP was ubiquitously expressed in glioma cells, immune
      cells, and glioma tissue, but did not correlate with glioma grade. Finally, an
      interaction between AAMP and B7-H3 could be observed on expression level, hinting
      toward a combined synergistic effect. Conclusions: AAMP was identified as a novel
      interaction partner of B7-H3, opening new possibilities to create a targeted
      therapy against the pro-tumorigenic costimulatory protein B7-H3.

TI  - UTE-T2* versus conventional T2* mapping to assess posterior cruciate ligament
      ultrastructure and integrity-an in-situ study.
PG  - 4190-4201
LID - 10.21037/qims-22-251 [doi]
AB  - Background: Clinical-standard morphologic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is
      limited in the refined diagnosis of posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injuries.
      Quantitative MRI sequences such as ultrashort echo-time (UTE)-T2* mapping or
      conventional T2* mapping have been theorized to quantify ligament (ultra-)
      structure and integrity beyond morphology. This study evaluates their diagnostic 
      potential in identifying and differentiating partial and complete PCL injuries in
      a standardized graded injury model. Methods: Ten human cadaveric knee joint
      specimens were imaged on a clinical 3.0 T MRI scanner using morphologic,
      conventional T2* mapping, and UTE-T2* mapping sequences before and after
      standardized arthroscopic partial and complete PCL transection. Following manual 
      segmentation, quantitative T2* and underlying texture features (i.e., energy,
      homogeneity, and variance) were analyzed for each specimen and PCL condition,
      both for the entire PCL and its subregions. For statistical analysis, Friedman's 
      test followed by Dunn's multiple comparison test was used against the level of
      significance of P</=0.01. Results: For the entire PCL, T2* was significantly
      increased as a function of injury when acquired with the UTE-T2* sequence [entire
      PCL: 11.1+/-3.1 ms (intact); 10.9+/-4.6 ms (partial); 14.3+/-4.9 ms (complete);
      P<0.001], but not when acquired with the conventional T2* sequence [entire PCL:
      10.0+/-3.2 ms (intact); 11.4+/-6.2 ms (partial); 15.5+/-7.8 ms (complete);
      P=0.046]. The PCL subregions and texture variables showed variable changes
      indicative of injury-associated disorganization. Conclusions: In contrast to the 
      conventional T2* mapping, UTE-T2* mapping is more receptive in the detection of
      structural damage of the PCL and allows quantitative assessment of ligament
      (ultra-)structure and integrity that may help to improve diagnostic
      differentiation of distinct injury states. Once further substantiated beyond the 
      in-situ setting, UTE-T2* mapping may refine diagnostic evaluation of PCL injuries
      and -possibly- monitor ligament healing, ageing, degeneration, and inflammation.

TI  - Diagnosis and survival analyses of patients with space-occupying cardiac lesions:
      a 10-year retrospective single-center study.
PG  - 4081-4094
LID - 10.21037/qims-21-1151 [doi]
AB  - Background: Space-occupying cardiac lesions are uncommon but fatal.
      Echocardiography can identify diseases quickly in the clinic. This study reviews 
      the clinical data of patients with space-occupying cardiac lesions in the past 10
      years and analyzes their echocardiographic features, pathological diagnosis, and 
      prognosis. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 412 patients
      admitted to Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, 
      Nanjing from 2011 to 2020. All patients were diagnosed with cardiac masses based 
      on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and transesophageal echocardiography
      (TEE). We compared the diagnostic results of echocardiography and the
      postoperative pathological diagnosis and analyzed the characteristics of
      different types of space-occupying cardiac lesions. We also compared the
      mortality of patients with different types of space-occupying cardiac lesions
      through follow-up results of postoperative patients. Results: The 412 patients
      included 189 males and 223 females. Among them, 214 patients had benign tumors
      (including 176 patients with myxomas), 29 had primary malignant tumors, 32 had
      metastatic tumors, 41 had thrombi, 92 had infectious neoplasms, and 4 patients
      had special types of space-occupying lesions. A total of 376 lesions were
      correctly characterized by TTE, with an accuracy of 91.3%. Patients with benign
      tumors (9/214), thrombi (4/41), infectious neoplasms (5/92), or special types of 
      space-occupying lesions (0/4) exhibited low rates of mortality or recurrence. In 
      contrast, patients with primary malignant tumors (16/29) or metastatic tumors
      (16/32) exhibited high mortality rates. Conclusions: Echocardiography is a
      valuable tool for characterizing space-occupying cardiac lesions. It can provide 
      important preoperative diagnostic information for cardiothoracic surgeons.

TI  - Correlation between apparent diffusion coefficient and tumor-stroma ratio in
      hybrid (18)F-FDG PET/MRI: preliminary results of a rectal cancer cohort study.
PG  - 4213-4225
LID - 10.21037/qims-21-938 [doi]
AB  - Background: To explore possible correlations between the tumor-stroma ratio (TSR)
      and different imaging features of fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron
      emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging ((18)F-FDG PET/MRI) in untreated
      rectal cancer patients. Methods: A patients with rectal cancer were included in
      this study. All participants were examined preoperatively with whole-body
      (18)F-FDG PET/MRI. Two pathologists evaluated the TSR of tumors together.
      Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values and PET-related parameters of the
      primary lesions were measured and compared between the stroma-high and stroma-low
      groups. Pearson's correlation or Spearman's rank correlation were used to
      evaluate the correlation between the ADC values, PET-related parameters, and
      pathological indices. Results: Our results showed that in the untreated rectal
      cancer patients, the ADC mean values correlated with the TSR (r=0.327; P=0.007), 
      and stroma-high (low TSR) rectal cancer corresponded to relatively lower ADC mean
      values (813.54+/-88.68 vs. 879.92+/-133.18; P=0.018). The ADC mean and ADC
      minimum (ADCmin) values were found to be negatively correlated with the
      pathological T stages (r=-0.384, P=0.001; r=-0.416, P=0.001, respectively) as
      well as the largest tumor diameters (r=-0.340, P=0.005; r=-0.314, P=0.010,
      respectively) of rectal cancer. In addition, the pathological T stages correlated
      with all PET-related metabolic parameters, including mean standard uptake value
      (SUV), maximum SUV (SUVmax), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and total lesion
      glycolysis (TLG) (r=0.338, P=0.006; r=0.350, P=0.004; r=0.326, P=0.007; and
      r=0.472, P<0.001, respectively). Our results also identified associations between
      the ADCmin values and SUVmean, SUVmax, and TLG (r=-0.335, P=0.006; r=-0.343,
      P=0.005; and r=-0.343, P=0.005, respectively). However, there were no statistical
      correlations between the PET/MRI parameters and the immunohistochemical (IHC)
      results. Conclusions: This study indicated that the intratumoral heterogeneity
      measured by PET/MRI may reflect characteristics of the tumor microenvironment.
      Hence, PET/MRI parameters might be helpful in predicting tumor aggressiveness and
      prognosis.

PG  - 4135-4150
LID - 10.21037/qims-21-1167 [doi]
AB  - Background: Microvascular invasion (MVI) is a critical risk factor for early
      recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma 
      (ICC). The aim of this study was to explore the contribution of
      (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography
      ((18)F-FDG PET/CT) radiomic features for the preoperative prediction of HCC and
      ICC classification and MVI. Methods: In this retrospective study, 127 (HCC: ICC
      =76:51) patients with suspected MVI accompanied by either HCC or ICC were
      included (In HCC group, MVI positive: negative =46:30 in ICC group, MVI positive:
      negative =31:20). Results-driven feature engineering workflow was used to select 
      the most predictive feature combinations. The prediction model was based on
      supervised machine learning classifier. Ten-fold cross validation on training
      cohort and independent test cohort were constructed to ensure stability and
      generalization ability of models. Results: For HCC and ICC classification,
      radiomics predictors composed of two PET and one CT feature achieved area under
      the curve (AUC) of 0.86 (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity was 0.82, 0.78, 0.88,
      respectively) on test cohort. For MVI prediction, in HCC group, our MVI
      prediction model achieved AUC of 0.88 (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity was
      0.78, 0.88, 0.60 respectively) with three PET features associated with tumor
      stage on test cohort. In ICC group, the phenotype composed of two PET features
      and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) achieved AUC of 0.90 (accuracy,
      sensitivity, specificity was 0.77, 0.75, 0.80, respectively). Conclusions:
      (18)F-FDG PET/CT radiomic features integrating clinical factors have potential in
      HCC and ICC classification and MVI prediction, while PET features have dominant
      predictive power in model performance. The prediction model has value in
      providing a non-invasive biomarker for an earlier indication and comprehensive
      quantification of primary liver cancers.

TI  - The value of noncontrast MRI in evaluating breast imaging reporting and data
      system category 0 lesions on digital mammograms.
PG  - 4069-4080
LID - 10.21037/qims-21-968 [doi]
AB  - Background: Benign and malignant diagnosis of nonpalpable breast imaging
      reporting and data system (BI-RADS) category 0 lesions on digital mammograms
      (DMs) is very important. We compared the diagnostic performance of
      non-contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and dynamic
      contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) for them. We sought to
      evaluate BI-RADS category 0 lesions using 3 MRI sequences: short tau inversion
      recovery (STIR), STIR combined with high b value diffusion-weighted imaging
      (STIR-DWI), and DCE-MRI. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 114 breast DMs
      rated as nonpalpable BI-RADS category 0 lesions in 112 patients from January 2014
      to June 2019. STIR, high b value DWI, and DCE-MRI were performed for all
      patients. Two breast radiologists read individual sequences (STIR, DWI, DCE-MRI) 
      and pairs of sequences (STIR-DWI) to detect BI-RADS category 0 lesions in DMs.
      Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to assess
      diagnostic performance according to a best valuable comparator that combined MRI 
      imaging, clinical, and pathological data. Results: Among of 114 lesions (the
      median age of patients was 47 years; the median size of the lesion was 19 mm), 32
      (48.5%) malignant lesions were missed by STIR, 9 (13.6%) malignant lesions were
      missed by STIR-DWI, and 3 (4.5%) malignant lesions were missed by DCE-MRI. The
      principal finding of our study was that STIR-DWI and DCE-MRI showed higher
      diagnostic accuracy than did STIR (P<0.01). STIR-DWI showed higher accuracy [area
      under the curve (AUC) =0.858; sensitivity =87.8%] for BI-RADS category 0 lesions 
      in DMs than did STIR (AUC =0.754; sensitivity =51.5%), while the performance was

AB  - Background: Radiation therapy is one of the essential treatment modalities for
      invasive thymomas. Clinically, respiratory motion poses a challenge for the
      radiotherapy of thoracic tumors. One method to address this issue is to train
      patients to hold their breath at the end of deep inspiration. The purpose of this
      retrospective cohort study was to investigate the dosimetric and clinical
      advantages of the deep inspiration breath-hold (DIBH) technique in postoperative 
      intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for thymomas. Methods: Thymoma
      patients undergoing postoperative IMRT were included. Each patient underwent two 
      computed tomography (CT) scans, one under free breath (FB) and the other under
      DIBH. Dosimetric parameters of organs at risk (OARs) were evaluated in three
      series plans. Dose analysis and volume comparisons were conducted during FB-3 mm 
      (FB with 3 mm internal target volume margin), FB-10 mm (FB with 10 mm internal
      target volume margin), and DIBH and compared using a paired sample Student's
      t-test. Normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCP) for lungs and heart were 
      calculated and compared. Results: The total lung volume significantly increased
      by 31% (4,216+/-198 vs. 2,884+/-166 mL) and the heart volume reduced by 12%
      (552+/-25 vs. 636+/-35 mL) between DIBH acquisitions compared to FB. A
      significant improvement was observed in all the dosimetric parameters (Dmean,
      V20, V5) of the lung on DIBH compared to FB-3 mm (54%+/-2.85% vs. 47%+/-2.90%,
      P<0.001; 15%+/-1.37% vs. 12%+/-1.32%, P=0.004; and 10.28+/-0.58 vs. 8.76+/-0.57
      Gy, P<0.001, respectively), as well as in the Dmax and D2% of the esophagus and
      spine. The lung volume increment was related to a reduction in the mean dose of
      lungs, with a correlation coefficient of r=0.27, P=0.03. The NTCP values for
      pneumonitis significantly reduced with DIBH compared to the FB state (0.6% vs.
      1.1%, P<0.001). Conclusions: The radiation dose to the OARs can be significantly 
      reduced by using the DIBH technique in postoperative IMRT for thymomas. The
      increased volume of lungs using DIBH acquisitions can significantly reduce the
      incidence of pneumonitis.

      Membrane Protein MPV17 in Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
PG  - 7236823
LID - 10.1155/2022/7236823 [doi]
AB  - Background: Liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) is the predominant type of
      liver cancer, and its treatment still faces great challenges presently.
      Mitochondrial inner membrane protein MPV17 is reported to be involved in multiple
      biological activities of cancers. Here, we seek to investigate the specific role 
      and functions of MPV17 in LIHC progression. Methods: Firstly, MPV17 expressions
      in various tumors and corresponding normal samples and LIHC groups with various
      clinical features were analyzed, respectively. Next, the relationship between
      MPV17 expression and LIHC survival was analyzed and verified by AUC curves.
      Besides, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for LIHC were screened from TCGA
      and then analyzed by GO and KEGG. Then, MPV17 was analyzed by prognostic model,
      Cox analysis, predictive nomogram, pathway correlation, and immunoassay. Finally,
      the functions of MPV17 were determined by CCK-8 and Tranwell assays. Results: In 
      most tumors, MPV17 expression was higher than that in the normal group, and it
      was related to LIHC clinical features. In the LIHC survival analysis, highly
      expressed MPV17 was associated with a poor prognosis. Besides, 314 upregulated
      and 193 downregulated DEGs are mainly involved in the TNF signaling pathway and
      tyrosine metabolism. Through prognostic model, Cox analysis, and predictive
      nomogram, MPV17 had the prognostic value for LIHC. Gene-pathway correlation
      analysis showed that MPV17 had the strongest correlation with the G2M_checkpoint 
      pathway. In an immunoassay, MPV17 had a strong correlation with many immune
      cells. Functional assays showed that MPV17 reduction in LIHC cells could inhibit 
      cell invasion, migration, and proliferation. Conclusion: MPV17, as a tumor
      promoter, could be a new biomarker for LIHC diagnosis and prognosis and probably 
      shed new light on the exploration of LIHC therapies.

      Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 2319161
LID - 10.1155/2022/2319161 [doi]
AB  - A literature review showed some discrepancies regarding the association of
      -592C/A with the risk of cervical cancer. To allow more precise analysis of the
      data by increasing the number of cases studied and more acceptable generalization
      by considering results from different sources, the present meta-analysis was
      performed on available published studies that explored the relationship between
      SNP-592C/A of the IL-10 gene and the risk of cervical cancer. Eleven available
      studies, including 4187 cases and 3311 controls, were included in this study
      investigating the relationship between the -592C/A polymorphism of IL-10 and
      cervical cancer risk. Fixed-effects or random-effects models were performed with 
      pooled odds ratios (ORs). Heterogeneity and bias tests were performed by the
      inconsistency test and funnel plot, respectively. The overall analysis showed an 
      increased susceptibility to cervical cancer with the -592C/A polymorphism of the 
      IL-10 gene for the recessive model (OR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.14-1.49), dominant
      model (OR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.09-1.70), and additive model (OR = 1.25, 95% CI =
      1.09-1.44). Regarding ethnicity, a significant association of the -592C/A
      polymorphism of the IL-10 gene was linked to an elevated risk of cervical cancer 
      for all genetic models (recessive, dominant, and additive) in the Asian
      populations and for the recessive and additive models in Caucasians with P <
      0.05. The -592C/A polymorphism of the IL-10 gene may be considered a risk factor 
      for cervical cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Primary liver cancer (PLC) is classified into hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC), intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), and combined
      hepatocellular and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (CHC). We investigated the
      genomic landscape of PLC according to the histological classification and
      established a cross-histological molecular subtyping for PLC by a multi-omics
      analysis. METHODS: We analyzed 265 PLC cases with whole-exome sequencing and DNA 
      copy number analyses and 251 cases with gene expression profiling. RESULTS: The
      cohort included HCC (n=223, 84%), ICC (n=34, 13%), and CHC (n=8, 3%). Mutation
      analyses identified histological type-specific driver genes, such as CTNNB1 in
      HCC and KRAS, IDH1, and PIK3CA in ICC, and ARID1A and KMT2C in CHC. The tumor
      suppressor gene TP53 mutation was detected in 21.1% of HCC, 16.1% of ICC, and
      25.0% of CHC cases. Other well-characterized tumor suppressor genes included RB1,
      which was mutated in 2.8% of HCC and 3.2% of ICC; and PTEN, which was mutated in 
      1.4% of HCC, 3.2% of ICC, and 12.5% of CHC cases. DNA copy number analyses
      identified focal amplifications, with NUF2 (1q23.3) the most frequently detected 
      as an amplified gene in all 3 types (HCC, 3.8%; CHC, 12.5%, ICC, 3.2%). Molecular
      subtyping for PLC based on the multi-omics analysis identified three subtypes,
      one of which was associated with recurrence after resection and amplified genes
      located at chromosome 8q. CONCLUSIONS: Our dataset serves as a fundamental
      resource for genomic medicine for PLC in Japan and identified amplified genes
      located at chromosome 8q as promising therapeutic targets for the subgroup with a
      poor prognosis. FigureS 1.

TI  - Retrospective evaluation of slim fully covered self-expandable metallic stent for
      unresectable malignant hilar biliary obstruction.
LID - 10.1002/jhbp.1221 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There was few reports of covered self-expandable metallic stent
      (SEMS) placement for malignant hilar-biliary obstruction (MHBO) because of risk
      of biliary branch obstruction. We studied feasibility and efficacy of
      6-mm-diameter slim-fully covered SEMS (SFCSEMS) in relatively large cohort.
      METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated SFCSEMS in unresectable MHBO from December 
      2016 to September 2021 in Juntendo University Hospital. RESULTS: We enrolled
      consecutive 54 unresectable MHBO (18 bile duct, 11 gallbladder, 8 pancreatic, 2
      hepatocellular and 15 metastatic cancer) including Bismuth-type II (n=11), III
      (n=17), and IV (n=26), and placed two (n=35) or three (n=19) SFCSEMS. The
      technical and clinical success rate was 100% and 92.5%, respectively, with 76.3
      minutes of mean procedure time. Recurrent biliary obstruction (RBO) was observed 
      in 35.2% and the median cumulative time to RBO (TRBO) was 181 days. Other adverse
      event was 11.1% (4 mild-pancreatitis, 1 segmental-cholangitis, and 1
      cholecystitis). There was no failed case of stent exchange and 2nd SFCSEMS (n=6) 
      showed significantly lower RBO (16.7% vs. 81.8%, p=0.0364) and longer TRBO
      (undefined vs. 86 days; p=0.0617) than plastic stent (n=11). CONCLUSIONS:
      Endoscopic placement of SFCSEMS for unresectable MHBO was effective and feasible 
      with low incidence of segmental-cholangitis, and exchange strategy of SFCSEMS was
      promising.

TI  - Lumps and bumps: What not to miss.
LID - 10.1111/pde.15084 [doi]
AB  - The evaluation of pediatric patients with subcutaneous nodules remains a
      diagnostic challenge. Pediatric dermatologists are regularly confronted with
      patients who have a nonspecific nodule. Though most masses that require
      evaluation are ultimately benign, the possibility of a more aggressive process,
      including borderline or malignant neoplasms, underscores the pivotal role of the 
      pediatric dermatologist in recognizing these lesions. The aim of this review is
      to provide an overview of lumps and bumps that are important to recognize to
      prevent delay in diagnosis or treatment of a serious underlying condition.
      Clinical clues that may lead the pediatric dermatologist to have a higher index
      of suspicion for more aggressive lesions are reviewed. Suggestions for evaluation
      and workup, as well as tips for the difficult to discern lesion, are proposed.

TI  - Improvement of compliance to the Portland intensive insulin therapy during liver 
      transplantation after introducing an application software: a retrospective single
      center cohort study.
PG  - 312-319
LID - 10.17085/apm.22136 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Portland intensive insulin therapy effectively controls acute
      hyperglycemic change after graft reperfusion during liver transplantation.
      However, the time-consuming sophistication acts as a barrier leading to
      misinterpretation and decreasing compliance to the protocol; thus, we newly
      introduced an application software "Insulin protocol calculator" which
      automatically calculates therapeutic bolus/continuous insulin doses based on the 
      Portland protocol. METHODS: Of 144 patients who underwent liver transplantation, 
      74 patients were treated before the introduction of "Insulin protocol calculator"
      by using a paper manual, and 70 patients were treated by using the application.
      Compliance was defined as the proportion of patients treated with exact
      bolus/continuous insulin dose according to the Portland protocol. RESULTS:
      Compliance was significantly greater in app group than in paper group regarding
      bolus dose (94.5% and 86.9%, P < 0.001), continuous dose (88.9% and 77.3%, P =
      0.001), and both doses (86.6% and 73.8%, P < 0.001). Blood glucose concentration 
      was significantly lower in app group at 3 h (125 +/- 17 mg/dl vs. 136 +/- 19
      mg/dl, P = 0.014) and 4 h (135 +/- 22 mg/dl vs. 115 +/- 15 mg/dl, P = 0.029)
      after graft reperfusion. Acute hyperglycemic change during 30 min was more
      prominent in app group while hyperglycemia incidence was 71.4% vs. 54.1% (P =
      0.031). However, hyperglycemia risk was comparable at 2 h (31.4% vs. 31.1%, P =
      0.964), and even insignificantly lower in app group at 3 h (7.1% vs. 19.5%, P =
      0.184). CONCLUSIONS: Compliance to the Portland protocol was significantly
      improved after introducing the application software; post-reperfusion
      hyperglycemia was better controlled. "Insulin protocol calculator" is
      cost-effective and time-saving with potential clinical benefits.

TI  - Physical and Chemical Cues at Nano-bio Interface for Immunomodulation.
LID - 10.1002/anie.202209499 [doi]
AB  - Immunomodulation has made remarkable achievements in fighting against infectious 
      disease and cancer. Conventionally, immunomodulation largely relied on
      chemical/biochemical agents which, unfortunately, suffer from sever off-target
      adverse effects. Recent understandings on nano-bio interactions suggest that
      nanomaterials per se can directly participate in immunomodulation. A range of
      physical and chemical cues at nano-bio interface have been harnessed to regulate 
      diverse immuno-signaling for disease control and treatment. In this Minireview,
      we summarize recent studies of the physical and chemical cues enabled by
      intrinsic nanomaterials that trigger immunological signaling. Firstly, we discuss
      physical cues mediated by surface topography, hydrophobicity, charge and heat at 
      nano-bio interface for immunomodulation. Secondly, various chemical cues, such as
      metal species and oxidative species are outlined. Finally, our perspectives on
      the challenge and possible future directions are provided.

TI  - Factors influencing engagement in hospital-based exercise oncology programs: A
      narrative review.
LID - 10.1002/pmrj.12882 [doi]
AB  - Among cancer survivors, there are numerous health benefits of exercise
      engagement; however, less than 15% of survivors meet current aerobic and strength
      physical activity guidelines. Exercise programs provided by a cancer hospital are
      commonly noted as a facilitator and preference to exercise engagement. We aimed
      to review the evidence and describe the barriers, facilitators, preferences, and 
      factors associated with cancer survivors' engagement in hospital-based exercise
      oncology programs. We searched electronic databases (PubMed and Scopus) to
      identify relevant papers published before July 1, 2021. Original research papers 
      reporting on barriers, facilitators, preferences, or factors associated with
      participation in hospital-based exercise oncology programs were included. We
      identified 300 potentially relevant articles, of which 10 met eligibility
      criteria. Barriers to participation in hospital-based exercise oncology programs 
      included: program accessibility, treatment-related side-effects, and uncertainty 
      about exercise. Program individualization, peer support, and staff support were
      reported as facilitators. Survivors also expressed that they preferred
      flexibility in the time, location, and mode of exercise programming. Baseline
      quality of life, fitness, and marital status were all identified as potential
      factors associated with engagement in hospital-based exercise oncology programs. 
      These findings are useful for the development and implementation of
      hospital-based exercise oncology programs to optimize exercise program
      engagement. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

      eltrombopag was followed by two cycles of combined therapy. Amongst 31 patients, 
      there were no dose-limiting toxicities. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was 300 
      mg. Transient increases in bone marrow blasts at day 8 were common but no patient
      had protocol-defined progression following eltrombopag monotherapy. Marrow
      response rates after three and six treatment cycles were 32% and 29%
      respectively. In all, 70% of patients treated below and 36% treated at the MTD
      achieved a modified International Working Group 2006 platelet response at the end
      of cycle two. Of the platelet transfusion independent patients at baseline, 67%
      treated at the MTD became transfusion dependent during the first two cycles of
      treatment. Apart from lack of disease progression, our findings concur with a
      previously reported Phase III study (A StUdy of eltromboPag in myelodysPlastic
      SyndrOmes Receiving azaciTidine [SUPPORT]). We conclude that
      eltrombopag/azacitidine is safe in terms of conventional measures defined by
      adverse-event reporting. However, in light of SUPPORT and our own descriptive
      findings regarding efficacy, further combination studies in high-risk disease
      should be considered with caution.

TI  - Intravenous route for folate supplementation in a patient with celiac disease
      treated by pemetrexed-based chemotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer.
PG  - 10781552221117734
LID - 10.1177/10781552221117734 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Oral folic acid supplementation is essential for patients treated
      with pemetrexed, to prevent the risk of severe hematologic toxicity. In case of
      intestinal absorption disorder, no recommendations exist for intravenous folic
      acid supplementation. CASE REPORT: We describe a 74-year-old patient with
      multimetastatic non-small-cell lung adenocarcinoma, receiving first-line
      chemotherapy with carboplatin AUC5, pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) and pembrolizumab 200 
      mg intravenously every 3 weeks. The patient presented neglected celiac disease,
      resulting in malabsorption syndrome with iron and folic acid deficiency. The
      question was how to administer folic acid supplementation during the
      pemetrexed-based chemotherapy. MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOMES: Intravenous injection of 
      200 mg levoleucovorin on day 1 of cycle 1 of pemetrexed-based chemotherapy was
      administered and well tolerated. During the second cycle, the levoleucovorin
      perfusion was not renewed by omission. The patient was hospitalized for 7 days
      because of febrile aplasia. Piperacillin-tazobactam was started, and then
      switched to amoxicillin-clavulanate plus ciprofloxacin. After this episode of
      post-chemotherapy febrile aplasia, it was decided to systematically supplement
      the patient with intravenous levoleucovorin, with blood folate concentration
      monitoring at each cycle. At 16 months after start of treatment, the patient was 
      in complete remission, indicating that the immune-chemotherapy was effective,
      with no further febrile neutropenia. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: This case report
      highlights intravenous levoleucovorin supplementation as an alternative to oral
      folic acid if needed during pemetrexed-antifolate-based chemotherapy.

TI  - Fusion transcript analysis reveals slower response kinetics than multiparameter
      flow cytometry in childhood acute myeloid leukaemia.
LID - 10.1111/ijlh.13935 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Analysis of measurable residual disease (MRD) is increasingly being
      implemented in the clinical care of children and adults with acute myeloid
      leukaemia (AML). However, MRD methodologies differ and discordances in results
      lead to difficulties in interpretation and clinical decision-making. The aim of
      this study was to compare results from reverse transcription quantitative
      polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) in
      childhood AML and describe the kinetics of residual leukaemic burden during
      induction treatment. METHODS: In 15 children who were treated in the NOPHO-AML
      2004 trial and had fusion transcripts quantified by RT-qPCR, we compared MFC with
      RT-qPCR for analysis of MRD during (day 15) and after induction therapy. Eight
      children had RUNX1::RUNX1T1, one CBFB::MYH11 and six KMT2A::MLLT3. RESULTS: When 
      >/=0.1% was used as cut-off for positivity, 10 of 22 samples were discordant. The
      majority (9/10) were MRD positive with RT-qPCR but MRD negative with MFC, and
      several such cases showed the presence of mature myeloid cells. Fusion transcript
      expression was verified in mature cells as well as in CD34 expressing cells
      sorted from diagnostic samples. CONCLUSIONS: Measurement with RT-qPCR suggests
      slower response kinetics than indicated from MFC, presumably due to the presence 
      of mature cells expressing fusion transcript. The prognostic impact of early
      measurements with RT-qPCR remains to be determined.

      Nanoassembly of Fluorinated Prodrug and siRNA.
PG  - e2203019
LID - 10.1002/adma.202203019 [doi]
AB  - Chemoimmunotherapy has shown great potential to activate immune response, but
      immunosuppressive microenvironment associated T cell exhaustion remains a
      challenge in cancer therapy. The proper immune-modulatory strategy to provoke a
      robust immune response is to simultaneously regulate T-cell exhaustion and
      infiltration. Here, a new kind of carrier-free nanoparticle (NP) was developed to
      simultaneously deliver chemotherapeutic drug (doxorubicin, DOX), cytolytic
      peptide (melittin, MPI), and anti-TOX small interfering RNA (thymocyte
      selection-associated high mobility group box protein, TOX) using a fluorinated
      prodrug strategy. In this way, the enhanced immunogenic cell death induced by the
      combination of DOX and MPI can act as "offense" signaling to increase CD8(+)
      T-cell infiltration, while the decreased TOX expression interfered with siTOX can
      serve as "defense" signaling to mitigate CD8(+) T-cell exhaustion. As a result,
      the integration of DOX, MPI, and siTOX in such a bifunctional system produced a
      potent antitumor immune response in liver cancer and metastasis, making it a
      promising delivery platform and effective strategy for converting "cold" tumors
      into "hot" ones. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

TI  - Discoidin domain receptor-driven gene signatures as markers of patient response
      to anti-PD-L1 immune checkpoint therapy.
LID - djac140 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jnci/djac140 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint therapies (ICTs) only provided
      durable responses in a subset of cancer patients. Thus, biomarkers are needed to 
      predict non-responders and offer them alternative treatments. We recently
      implicated discoidin domain receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (DDR2) as a contributor to
      anti-PD-1 resistance in animal models; therefore, we sought to investigate if
      this gene family may provide ICT response prediction. METHODS: We assessed mRNA
      expression of DDR2 and its family member DDR1. Transcriptome analysis of BCa
      models in which DDR1 and 2 were perturbed was used to derive DDR1- and
      DDR2-driven signature scores. DDR mRNA expression and gene signature scores were 
      evaluated using BCa TCGA (n = 259) and IMvigor210 (n = 298) datasets, and their
      relationship to BCa subtypes, pathway enrichment, and immune deconvolution
      analyses were performed. The potential of DDR-driven signatures to predict ICT
      response were evaluated and independently validated through a statistical
      framework in bladder and lung cancer cohorts. All statistical tests were 2-sided.
      RESULTS: DDR1 and DDR2 showed mutually exclusive gene expression patterns in
      human tumors. DDR2high BCa exhibited activation of immune pathways and a high
      "immune score", indicative of a T-cell-inflamed phenotype, while DDR1high BCa
      exhibited a non-T-cell-inflamed phenotype. In IMvigor210 cohort, tumors with high
      DDR1 (HR = 1.53 95% CI = [1.16-2.06], P=.003) or DDR2 (HR = 1.42 95% CI =
      [1.01-1.92], P=.04) scores had poor overall survival (OS). Of note, DDR2high
      tumors from IMvigor210 and CheckMate 275 (n = 73) cohorts exhibited poorer OS (HR
      = 1.56 95% CI = [1.20-2.06], P<.001) and progression-free survival (HR = 1.77 95%
      CI = [1.05-3.00], P=.047), respectively. This was validated in independent cancer
      datasets. CONCLUSIONS: These findings implicate DDR1/2-driven signature scores in
      predicting ICT response.

TI  - I-PET score: combining whole body iodine and (18) F-FDG PET/CT imaging to predict
      progression in structurally or biochemically incomplete thyroid cancer.
LID - 10.1111/cen.14804 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We propose a new scoring system (I-PET) combining WBS and FDG findings
      to identify patients who have or are likely to become refractory to RAI. METHODS:
      Retrospective analysis of 142 patients age>18 with DTC who had a (18F) FDG PET
      and WBS within a 6 month period between 2010-2020. Pairs of (18F) FDG PET and WBS
      were reviewed by three independent nuclear medicine physicians and an I-PET score
      was assigned: I-PET[0]:Iodine-ve/FDG-ve, I-PET[1]:Iodine+ve/FDG-ve,
      I-PET[2]:Iodine+ve/FDG +ve and I-PET[3]:Iodine-ve/ FDG+ve. Patients with FDG+ve
      lesions (I-PET[2] and I-PET[3]) were further classified into group A and B if
      SUVmax was </=5 or >5 respectively. Follow-up data was obtained by chart review. 
      Progression was defined as structural progression as per RECIST 1.1 or further
      surgical intervention; or biochemical progression as unstimulated thyroglobulin
      increasing > 20% from baseline. RESULTS: Of 142 patients included in the study
      121 patients had follow up data available for review. At baseline, 49 patients
      were classified as I-PET[0], 10 as I-PET[1], 16 as I-PET[2] and 46 as I-PET[3].
      Progression was seen in 11/49(22%) of I-PET[0], 4/10(40%) of I-PET[1], 10/16(63%)
      of I-PET[2] and 34/46(74%) of I-PET[3] (p < 0.001). I-PET[2B] and I-PET[3B] had a
      progression rate of 88%(7/8) and 78%(25/32) respectively. I-PET[3B] were 9.6
      times more likely to commence multikinase inhibitor therapy (p=0.001) and had 8
      times greater mortality (p=0.003) than patients in other I-PET groups combined.
      CONCLUSION: I-PET is a simple readily acquired imaging biomarker that potentially
      enhances the dynamic risk stratification and guide treatment in thyroid cancer.

TI  - Testosterone analysis in castrated prostate cancer patients: suitability of the
      castration cut-off and analytical accuracy of the present-day clinical
      immunoassays.
LID - 10.1515/cclm-2022-0506 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Testosterone testing is relevant for evaluating castration adequacy
      and diagnosis of castration-resistant prostate cancer (PCa). However, the
      recommended testosterone cut-off of 1.7 nmol/L (50 ng/dL) to define adequate
      castration is based on consensus and not validated for the automated immunoassays
      (AIA) used in today's medical laboratories. Furthermore, appropriate population
      intervals have not been determined by a state-of-the-art assay. We investigated
      the analytical suitability of this cut-off and the accuracy of the present-day
      AIAs for testosterone analysis in castrated PCa patients. METHODS: Leftover serum
      from 120 PCa patients castrated with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone
      agonists was analysed for testosterone by five methods: Architect i2000 (Abbott),
      Access (Beckman), Cobas 6000 (Roche), Atellica (Siemens), LC-MS/MS. For all
      assays, the castration 95th, 97.5th and 99th percentile upper limits were
      determined. Furthermore, Passing-Bablok regression, mean bias and Spearman's
      correlation coefficients were compared to the LC-MS/MS method and total error
      based on biological variation. RESULTS: All castration upper limits, ranging from
      0.472 nmol/L (LC-MS/MS) to 1.25 nmol/L (Access) (95% percentile), were
      significantly lower than the current castration cut-off (1.7 nmol/L). Slopes of
      Passing-Bablok regressions comparing the AIA with the LC-MS/MS method ranged from
      1.4 (Cobas and Atellica) to 3.8 (Access). The Architect showed the highest
      correlation with LC-MS/MS (rho=0.58). All AIA failed to meet the desirable total 
      error criterion. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that a lower general
      testosterone castration cut-off may be more appropriate in evaluating the
      adequacy of castration in PCa and that present-day AIA lack analytical accuracy
      to quantify testosterone levels in castrated PCa.

TI  - Targeting the radiation-induced ARv7-mediated circNHS/miR-512-5p/XRCC5 signaling 
      with Quercetin increases prostate cancer radiosensitivity.
PG  - 235
LID - 10.1186/s13046-022-02287-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Radiation therapy (RT) with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is an 
      effective therapy to suppress the locally advanced prostate cancer (PCa).
      However, we unexpectedly found that RT could also induce the androgen receptor
      splice variant 7 (ARv7) expression to decrease the radiosensitivity. METHODS: The
      study was designed to target ARv7 expression with Quercetin or ARv7-shRNA that
      leads to enhancing and increasing the radiation sensitivity to better suppress
      the PCa that involved the modulation of the circNHS/miR-512-5p/XRCC5 signaling.
      RESULTS: Mechanism studies revealed that RT-induced ARv7 may function via
      altering the circNHS/miR-512-5p/XRCC5 signaling to decrease the radiosensitivity.
      Results from preclinical studies using multiple in vitro cell lines and in vivo
      mouse models concluded that combining RT with the small molecule of Quercetin to 
      target full-length AR and ARv7 could lead to better efficacy to suppress PCa
      progression. CONCLUSION: Together, these results suggest that ARv7 may play key
      roles to alter the PCa radiosensitivity, and targeting this newly identified ARv7
      mediated circNHS/miR-512-5p/XRCC5 signaling with Quercetin may help physicians to
      develop a novel RT to better suppress the progression of PCa.

TI  - AKT phosphorylation as a predictive biomarker for PI3K/mTOR dual
      inhibition-induced proteolytic cleavage of mTOR companion proteins in small cell 
      lung cancer.
PG  - 122
LID - 10.1186/s13578-022-00862-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Constitutive activation of PI3K signaling has been well recognized in
      a subset of small cell lung cancer (SCLC), the cancer type which has the most
      aggressive clinical course amongst pulmonary tumors. Whereas cancers that acquire
      a mutation/copy gain in PIK3CA or loss of PTEN have been implicated in enhanced
      sensitivity to inhibitors targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, the complexities
      of the pathway and corresponding feedback loops hamper clear predictions as to
      the response of tumors presenting these genomic features. METHODS: The
      correlation between the expression profile of proteins involved in the
      PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling and cell viability in response to treatment with small
      molecule inhibitors targeting isoform-specific PI3Ks, AKT, and mTOR was assessed 
      in 13 SCLC cancer cell lines. Athymic nude mice were used to determine the effect
      of PI3K/mTOR dual inhibition on the growth of xenograft SCLC tumors in vivo. The 
      activation of caspase signaling and proteolytic cleavages of mTOR companion
      proteins were assessed using recombinant caspases assays and Western blot
      analyses. RESULTS: Our results indicate that the sensitivity of these SCLC cell
      lines to GSK2126458, a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, is positively correlated with
      the expression levels of phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) at Thr308 and Ser473.
      Inhibition of pan-class I PI3Ks or PI3K/mTOR dual inhibition was shown to induce 
      proteolytic cleavage of RICTOR and RPTOR, which were respectively dependent on
      Caspase-6 and Caspase-3. A combination of a clinically approved
      PI3Kalpha-selective inhibitor and an mTORC1 inhibitor was shown to have
      synergistic effects in inducing the death of SCLC cells with high p-AKT. We
      observed no clear correlation between PTEN levels and the survival of SCLCs in
      response to PI3K/mTOR dual inhibition; however, PTEN depletion was shown to
      increase the susceptibility of low p-AKT SCLC cells to dual PI3K/mTOR
      inhibitor-induced cell death as well as the proteolytic cleavage of RICTOR.
      CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest the level of p-AKT can be a companion
      diagnostic biomarker for the treatment of SCLC involving the combinational use of
      clinically approved isoform-specific PI3K and mTOR inhibitors.

TI  - Non-coding RNAs in lung cancer: emerging regulators of angiogenesis.
PG  - 349
LID - 10.1186/s12967-022-03553-x [doi]
AB  - Lung cancer is the second cancer and the leading cause of tumor-related mortality
      worldwide. Angiogenesis is a crucial hallmark of cancer development and a
      promising target in lung cancer. However, the anti-angiogenic drugs currently
      used in the clinic do not achieve long-term efficacy and are accompanied by
      severe adverse reactions. Therefore, the development of novel anti-angiogenic
      therapeutic approaches for lung cancer is urgently needed. Non-coding RNAs
      (ncRNAs) participate in multiple biological processes in cancers, including tumor
      angiogenesis. Many studies have demonstrated that ncRNAs play crucial roles in
      tumor angiogenesis. This review discusses the regulatory functions of different
      ncRNAs in lung cancer angiogenesis, focusing on the downstream targets and
      signaling pathways regulated by these ncRNAs. Additionally, given the recent
      trend towards utilizing ncRNAs as cancer therapeutics, we also discuss the
      tremendous potential applications of ncRNAs as biomarkers or novel
      anti-angiogenic tools in lung cancer.

TI  - Dancing in local space: rolling hoop orbital amplification combined with local
      cascade nanozyme catalytic system to achieve ultra-sensitive detection of
      exosomal miRNA.
PG  - 357
LID - 10.1186/s12951-022-01568-6 [doi]
AB  - The exosomal miRNA (exo-miRNA) derived from tumor cells contains rich biological 
      information that can effectively aid in the early diagnosis of disease. However, 
      the extremely low abundance imposes stringent requirements for accurate detection
      techniques. In this study, a novel, protease-free DNA amplification strategy,
      known as "Rolling Hoop Orbital Amplification" (RHOA), was initially developed
      based on the design concept of local reaction and inspired by the childhood game 
      of rolling iron ring. Benefiting from the local space constructed by the DNA
      orbital, the circular DNA enzyme rolls directionally and interacts efficiently
      with the amplification element, making it nearly 3-fold more productive than
      conventional free-diffusion amplification. Similarly, the localized cascade
      nanozyme catalytic system formed by bridging DNA probes also exhibits
      outperformed than free ones. Therefore, a localized energized high-performance
      electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor was constructed by bridging cascading
      nanozymes on the electrode surface through DNA probes generated by RHOA, with an 
      impressive limit of detection (LOD) of 1.5 aM for the detection of exosomal
      miRNA15a-5p and a stable linearity over a wide concentration range from 10(- 2)
      to 10(8) fM. Thus, this work is a focused attempt at the localized reaction,
      which is expected to provide a reliable method for accurately detecting of
      exo-miRNAs.

TI  - BTApep-TAT peptide inhibits ADP-ribosylation of BORIS to induce DNA damage in
      cancer.
PG  - 158
LID - 10.1186/s12943-022-01621-w [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Brother of regulator of imprinted sites (BORIS) is expressed in most 
      cancers and often associated with short survival and poor prognosis in patients. 
      BORIS inhibits apoptosis and promotes proliferation of cancer cells. However, its
      mechanism of action has not been elucidated, and there is no known inhibitor of
      BORIS. METHODS: A phage display library was used to find the BORIS inhibitory
      peptides and BTApep-TAT was identified. The RNA sequencing profile of
      BTApep-TAT-treated H1299 cells was compared with that of BORIS-knockdown cells.
      Antitumor activity of BTApep-TAT was evaluated in a non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) xenograft mouse model. BTApep-TAT was also used to investigate the
      post-translational modification (PTM) of BORIS and the role of BORIS in DNA
      damage repair. Site-directed mutants of BORIS were constructed and used for
      investigating PTM and the function of BORIS. RESULTS: BTApep-TAT induced DNA
      damage in cancer cells and suppressed NSCLC xenograft tumor progression.
      Investigation of the mechanism of action of BTApep-TAT demonstrated that BORIS
      underwent ADP ribosylation upon double- or single-strand DNA damage. Substitution
      of five conserved glutamic acid (E) residues with alanine residues (A) between
      amino acids (AAs) 198 and 228 of BORIS reduced its ADP ribosylation. Inhibition
      of ADP ribosylation of BORIS by a site-specific mutation or by BTApep-TAT
      treatment blocked its interaction with Ku70 and impaired the function of BORIS in
      DNA damage repair. CONCLUSIONS: The present study identified an inhibitor of
      BORIS, highlighted the importance of ADP ribosylation of BORIS, and revealed a
      novel function of BORIS in DNA damage repair. The present work provides a
      practical method for the future screening or optimization of drugs targeting
      BORIS.

TI  - Beyond COVID-19 and lessons learned in the United States.
LID - 10.1111/tme.12896 [doi]
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic severely tested the resilience of the US blood supply with 
      wild fluctuations in blood donation and utilisation rates as community donation
      opportunities ebbed and hospitals post-poned elective surgery. Key stakeholders
      in transfusion services, blood centres, supply chains and manufacturers reviewed 
      their experiences during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic as well as available literature 
      to describe successes, opportunities for improvement and lessons learned. The
      blood community found itself in uncharted territory responding to restriction of 
      its access to donors (approximately 20% decrease) and some supplies;
      environmental adjustments to address staff and donor concerns about coronavirus
      transmission; and the development of a new product (COVID-19 convalescent plasma 
      [CCP]). In assuring that the needs of the patients were paramount, the donation
      process was safe, that clinicians had access to CCP, and vendor relationships
      aligned, the blood banking community relearned its primary focus: improving
      patient outcomes.

TI  - Protocol of trans-Tasman feasibility randomised controlled trial of the Younger
      Women's Wellness After Breast Cancer (YWWACP) lifestyle intervention.
PG  - 165
LID - 10.1186/s40814-022-01114-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Younger women (defined as those < 50 years who are likely
      pre-menopausal at time of diagnosis) with breast cancer often experience
      persistent treatment-related side effects that adversely affect their physical
      and psychological wellbeing. The Women's Wellness After Cancer Program (WWACP)
      was adapted and piloted in Australia to address these outcomes in younger women. 
      The aims of this feasibility study are to determine (1) the potential to
      translate the Younger WWACP (YWWACP) intervention to a broader population base in
      Aotearoa/New Zealand and Australia, and (2) the potential for success of a
      larger, international, phase IotaIotaIota, randomised controlled trial. METHODS: 
      This bi-national, randomised, single-blinded controlled trial involves two main
      study sites in Aotearoa/New Zealand (Kowhai study) and Australia (EMERALD study).
      Young women aged 18 to 50 years who completed intensive treatment (surgery,
      chemotherapy, and/or radiotherapy) for breast cancer in the previous 24 months
      are eligible. The potential to translate the YWWACP to women in these two
      populations will be assessed according to several feasibility outcomes. These
      include examining intervention accessibility, acceptability and uptake;
      intervention sustainability and adherence; the prevalence components of the
      intervention in the control group; intervention efficacy; participants'
      perception of measurement burden; the effectiveness of planned recruitment
      strategies; and trial methods and procedures. The studies collectively aim to
      enrol 60 participants in the intervention group and 60 participants in the
      control group (total = 120 participants). DISCUSSION: Ethical approval has been
      received from the Southern Health and Disability Ethics Committee (Kowhai ref:
      19/STH/215), and UnitingCare Human Research Ethics Committee (EMERALD ref:
      202103). This study will provide important data on the feasibility of the refined
      YWWACP in the trans-Tasman context. This study will account for and harmonise
      cross-country differences to ensure the success of a proposed international grant
      application for a phase IotaIotaIota randomised controlled trial of this program 
      to improve outcomes in younger women living with breast cancer. TRIAL

TI  - IDO/kynurenine pathway in cancer: possible therapeutic approaches.
PG  - 347
LID - 10.1186/s12967-022-03554-w [doi]
AB  - Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in both men and women worldwide. One
      of the main changes associated with cancer progression, metastasis, recurrence,
      and chemoresistance is the change in the tumor immune microenvironment,
      especially immunosuppression. Cancer immunosuppression appears in multiple forms,
      such as inhibition of immuno-stimulant cells with downregulation of
      immuno-stimulant mediators or through stimulation of immuno-suppressive cells
      with upregulation of immunosuppressive mediators. One of the most
      immunosuppressive mediators that approved potency in lung cancer progression is
      indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and its metabolite kynurenine (Kyn). The
      current review tries to elucidate the role of IDO/Kyn on cancer proliferation,
      apoptosis, angiogenesis, oxidative stress, and cancer stemness. Besides, our
      review investigates the new therapeutic modalities that target IDO/Kyn pathway
      and thus as drug candidates for targeting lung cancer and drugs that potentiate
      IDO/Kyn pathway and thus can be cancer-promoting agents.

      castration-resistant prostate cancer progression via
      S100A9/circMID1/miR-506-3p/MID1.
PG  - 346
LID - 10.1186/s12967-022-03494-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is a major cause of
      recurrence and mortality among prostate cancer (PCa) patients. Myeloid-derived
      suppressor cells (MDSCs) regulate castration resistance in PCa. Previously, it
      was shown that intercellular communication was efficiently mediated by exosomes
      (Exos), but the role and the mechanism of MDSC-derived Exos in CRPC progression
      was unclear. METHODS: In this study, the circRNA expression profiles in PC3 cells
      treated with MDSC-Exo and control cells were investigated using a circRNA
      microarray. RESULTS: The data showed that circMID1 (hsa_circ_0007718) expression 
      was elevated in PC3 cells treated with MDSC-Exo. Moreover, high circMID1
      expression was found in PCa compared with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)
      tissues and in CRPC patients compared with hormone sensitive prostate cancer
      (HSPC) patients. Further studies showed that MDSC-Exo accelerated PCa cell
      proliferation, migration, and invasion, while circMID1 deficiency inhibited
      MDSC-Exo-regulated CRPC progression in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically,
      MDSC-derived exosomal S100A9 increased circMID1 expression to sponge miR-506-3p, 
      leading to increased MID1 expression and accelerated tumor progression.
      CONCLUSION: Together, our results showed that a S100A9/circMID1/miR-506-3p/MID1
      axis existed in MDSC-Exo-regulated CRPC progression, which provided novel
      insights into MDSC-Exo regulatory mechanisms in CRPC progression.

TI  - Associations between dietary fiber intake and mortality from all causes,
      cardiovascular disease and cancer: a prospective study.
PG  - 344
LID - 10.1186/s12967-022-03558-6 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Several studies suggest that dietary fiber intake may reduce mortality
      risk, but this might depend on the fiber types and the evidence regarding the
      role of soluble fiber or insoluble fiber on death risk remain limited and
      inconsistent. Therefore, this study aimed to comprehensively evaluate multiple
      types of dietary fiber intake on mortality from all causes, cardiovascular
      disease and cancer in the large-scale Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian
      Cancer (PLCO) Screening Trial. METHODS: A multivariate Cox proportional hazards
      model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals
      (CIs). RESULTS: This study finally included 86,642 participants with 17,536
      all-cause deaths, 4842 cardiovascular deaths and 5760 cancer deaths identified
      after a total of 1,444,068 follow-up years. After adjusting for potential
      confounders, dietary total fiber intake was statistically significantly inversely
      associated with all-cause death (Q5 vs Q1: HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.66-0.75; P for trend
      < 0.001), cardiovascular death (Q5 vs Q1: HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.65-0.83; P for trend 
      < 0.001) and cancer mortality (Q5 vs Q1: HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.69-0.86; P for trend <
      0.001). Similar results were observed for both insoluble and soluble fiber
      intake. Restricted cubic spline model analysis suggested that there was a
      nonlinear association of dietary fiber intake with mortality risk (all P for
      nonlinearity < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In this large nationally representative sample
      of US adult population, intakes of total fiber, soluble fiber, and insoluble
      fiber were associated with lower risks of all-cause, cardiovascular and cancer
      mortality.

      such as Experience-Based Co-Design (EBCD) further allow service users to directly
      engage in developing, testing and implementing interventions and services
      alongside healthcare staff. This paper aims to explore how participants in an
      EBCD project came-over time-to perceive their role and involvement in
      co-designing a cancer care intervention. METHODS: The findings are based on our
      reflections, a research diary, email correspondence and fieldnotes from co-design
      events. Co-design participants who attended most of the ten co-design events took
      part through written reflections or audio-recorded video calls. Ten reflective
      pieces were collected from clinicians (n = 4), PPI group members/patient
      participants (n = 4), a doctoral researcher (n = 1) and a visual illustrator (n =
      1). Inductive data analysis of participant reflections was carried out using
      reflexive thematic analysis. Meeting fieldnotes, email correspondence and the
      researcher's diary were deductively analysed using the initial themes generated
      from this inductive analysis. RESULTS: Five main themes were identified: (1)
      changing perception of roles during the co-design process, (2) defining a
      'co-designer', (3) engagement and ownership, (4) role of the research facilitator
      in maintaining momentum, and (5) perceived benefits of involvement. CONCLUSION:
      Our findings show the changing perceptions of roles and contributions among
      participants over time. Patients typically described their role as co-designers
      in terms simply of sharing their experiences. In contrast, clinicians perceived
      themselves as co-designers because they were working with patients who were
      actively involved in decision-making. Levels of engagement were affected by
      several factors such as time and facilitation, but most participants came to view
      themselves as co-owners of the intervention. Overall, participants perceived
      their involvement as a positive experience with clinicians also reporting wider
      positive impacts on their clinical practice.

OAB - Experience-Based Co-Design is a method for helping patients and clinicians work
      together to improve healthcare services. Studies of participant experiences in
      projects which use this method and how they perceive the co-designer role are
      rare. Our study explores how we-patients and clinicians-saw our role and
      participation as co-designers over time. Our findings are based on our written
      and verbal reflections of participating in a co-design project aimed at
      developing an information resource booklet and film for use in cancer care. We
      also analysed meeting records, email messages between participants and a
      reflective diary kept by the researcher who was coordinating the project. Our
      findings show that views of our roles and contributions as co-design participants
      changed over time. Patients tended to see themselves as 'co-designers' simply
      because they shared their experiences throughout the co-design process. In
      contrast, clinicians saw themselves as 'co-designers' because they were working
      together with patients and making decisions with them. Factors such as time
      demands, and the skill of the facilitator affected the commitment of participants
      to co-design activities. Most participants regard the ownership of the newly
      developed information resources as being shared. Overall, we viewed our
      participation in the co-design project as a positive experience with results that
      will benefit clinical practice.

TI  - LINC00665 knockdown confers sensitivity in irradiated non-small cell lung cancer 
      cells through the miR-582-5p/UCHL3/AhR axis.
PG  - 350
LID - 10.1186/s12967-022-03516-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The resistance to radiotherapy remains a major obstacle that limits
      the efficacy of radiotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study
      aims to illustrate the molecular mechanism underlying the role of LINC00665 in
      the radiosensitivity of NSCLC, which involves ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L3
      (UCHL3). METHODS AND RESULTS: The expression of UCHL3 was determined in clinical 
      tissue samples collected from NSCLC patients and NSCLC cell lines. We found that 
      UCHL3 overexpression occurred in both NSCLC tissues and cells, associated with
      poor prognosis in NSCLC patients. Mechanistically, UCHL3 stabilized aryl
      hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) protein through deubiquitination, thereby promoting
      PD-L1 expression. UCHL3 reduced the radiosensitivity of NSCLC cells by
      stabilizing AhR protein. Upstream microRNAs (miRNAs) and lncRNAs of UCHL3 were
      predicted by microarray profiling and validated by functional experiments.
      LINC00665 functioned as a sponge of miR-582-5p and thus up-regulated the
      expression of the miR-582-5p target UCHL3. Gain- and loss- of function assays
      were performed to assess the effects of LINC00665, UCHL3 and miR-582-5p on the in
      vitro cell malignant behaviors and immune escape as well as on the in vivo tumor 
      growth. Silencing LINC00665 or overexpressing miR-582-5p enhanced the sensitivity
      of NSCLC cells to radiotherapy. LINC00665 augmented the immune escape of NSCLC
      cells in vitro and in vivo through stabilizing AhR protein via the
      miR-582-5p/UCHL3 axis. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, LINC00665 reduced the
      radiosensitivity of NSCLC cells via stabilization of AhR through the
      miR-582-5p/UCHL3 axis.

TI  - Hmga2 protein loss alters nuclear envelope and 3D chromatin structure.
PG  - 171
LID - 10.1186/s12915-022-01375-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The high-mobility group Hmga family of proteins are non-histone
      chromatin-interacting proteins which have been associated with a number of
      nuclear functions, including heterochromatin formation, replication,
      recombination, DNA repair, transcription, and formation of enhanceosomes. Due to 
      its role based on dynamic interaction with chromatin, Hmga2 has a pathogenic role
      in diverse tumors and has been mainly studied in a cancer context; however,
      whether Hmga2 has similar physiological functions in normal cells remains less
      explored. Hmga2 was additionally shown to be required during the exit of
      embryonic stem cells (ESCs) from the ground state of pluripotency, to allow their
      transition into epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs), and here, we use that system to
      gain further understanding of normal Hmga2 function. RESULTS: We demonstrated
      that Hmga2 KO pluripotent stem cells fail to develop into EpiLCs. By using this
      experimental system, we studied the chromatin changes that take place upon the
      induction of EpiLCs and we observed that the loss of Hmga2 affects the histone
      mark H3K27me3, whose levels are higher in Hmga2 KO cells. Accordingly, a
      sustained expression of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), responsible for
      H3K27me3 deposition, was observed in KO cells. However, gene expression
      differences between differentiating wt vs Hmga2 KO cells did not show any
      significant enrichments of PRC2 targets. Similarly, endogenous Hmga2 association 
      to chromatin in epiblast stem cells did not show any clear relationships with
      gene expression modification observed in Hmga2 KO. Hmga2 ChIP-seq confirmed that 
      this protein preferentially binds to the chromatin regions associated with
      nuclear lamina. Starting from this observation, we demonstrated that nuclear
      lamina underwent severe alterations when Hmga2 KO or KD cells were induced to
      exit from the naive state and this phenomenon is accompanied by a mislocalization
      of the heterochromatin mark H3K9me3 within the nucleus. As nuclear lamina (NL) is
      involved in the organization of 3D chromatin structure, we explored the possible 
      effects of Hmga2 loss on this phenomenon. The analysis of Hi-C data in wt and
      Hmga2 KO cells allowed us to observe that inter-TAD (topologically associated
      domains) interactions in Hmga2 KO cells are different from those observed in wt
      cells. These differences clearly show a peculiar compartmentalization of
      inter-TAD interactions in chromatin regions associated or not to nuclear lamina. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our results indicate that Hmga2 interacts with
      heterochromatic lamin-associated domains, and highlight a role for Hmga2 in the
      crosstalk between chromatin and nuclear lamina, affecting the establishment of
      inter-TAD interactions.

TI  - Readiness of health facilities to deliver non-communicable diseases services in
      Kenya: a national cross-sectional survey.
PG  - 985
LID - 10.1186/s12913-022-08364-w [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) account for an estimated 71% of all 
      global deaths annually and nearly 80% of these deaths occur in low- and
      middle-income countries. This study aimed to assess the readiness of existing
      healthcare systems at different levels of health care in delivering NCDs
      management and prevention services in Kenya. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of
      258 facilities was conducted between June 2019 and December 2020 using multistage
      sampling, examining facility readiness based on the availability of indicators
      such as equipment, diagnostic capacity, medicines and commodities, trained staff 
      and guidelines for NCDs management. Readiness scores were calculated as the mean 
      availability of tracer items expressed as a percentage and a cut-off threshold of
      >/= 70% was used to classify facilities as "ready" to manage NCDs. Descriptive
      and bivariate analyses were performed to assess the readiness of facilities by
      type, level, and location settings. Logistic regressions were used to identify
      factors associated with the readiness of facilities to provide disease-specific
      services. RESULTS: Of the surveyed facilities, 93.8% offered chronic respiratory 
      disease (CRD) diagnosis and/or management services, 82.2% diabetes mellitus,
      65.1% cardiovascular disease (CVD), and only 24.4% cervical cancer screening
      services. The mean readiness scores for diabetes mellitus (71%; 95% CI: 67-74)
      and CVD (69%; 95% CI: 66-72) were relatively high. Although CRD services were
      reportedly the most widely available, its mean readiness score was low (48%; 95% 
      CI: 45-50). The majority of facilities offering cervical cancer services had all 
      the necessary tracer items available to provide these services. Modeling results 
      revealed that private facilities were more likely to be "ready" to offer NCDs
      services than public facilities. Similarly, hospitals were more likely "ready" to
      provide NCDs services than primary health facilities. These disparities in
      service readiness extended to the regional and urban/rural divide. CONCLUSIONS:
      Important gaps in the current readiness of facilities to manage NCDs in Kenya at 
      different levels of health care were revealed, showing variations by disease and 
      healthcare facility type. A collective approach is therefore needed to bridge the
      gap between resource availability and population healthcare needs.

TI  - Risk factors for rebleeding and long-term outcomes in patients with head and neck
      cancer bleeding: a multicenter study.
PG  - 841
LID - 10.1186/s12885-022-09945-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute, catastrophic bleeding in patients with head and neck cancer
      (HNC) is challenging and also a burden for their families and frontline
      physicians. This study analyzed the risk factors for rebleeding and long-term
      outcomes in these patients with HNC. METHODS: Patients who presented to the
      emergency department (ED) with HNC bleeding were enrolled in this study (N =
      231). Variables of patients with or without rebleeding were compared, and
      associated factors were investigated using Cox's proportional hazard model.
      RESULTS: Of the 231 patients enrolled, 112 (48.5%) experienced a recurrent
      bleeding event. The cumulative rebleeding incidence rate was 23% at 30 days, 49% 
      at 180 days, and 56% at 1 year. Multivariate Cox regression analyses demonstrated
      that overweight-to-obesity (HR = 0.52, 95% CI 0.28-0.98, p = 0.043), laryngeal
      cancer (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07-4.23, p =
      0.031), chemoradiation (HR = 1.49, 95% CI 1.001-2.94, p = 0.049), and second
      primary cancer (HR = 1.75, 95% CI 1.13-2.70, p = 0.012) are significant
      independent predictors of rebleeding, and the prognostic factors for overall
      survival included underweight (HR = 1.89, 95% CI 1.22-2.93, p = 0.004), heart
      rate > 110 beats/min (HR = 1.58, 95% CI 1.04-2.39, p = 0.032), chemoradiation (HR
      = 2.31, 95% CI 1.18-4.52, p = 0.015), and local recurrence (HR = 1.74, 95% CI
      1.14-2.67, p = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: Overweight-to-obesity is a protective factor,
      while laryngeal cancer, chemoradiation and a second primary cancer are risk
      factors for rebleeding in patients with HNC. Our results may assist physicians in
      risk stratification of patients with HNC bleeding.

TI  - Targeted delivery of irinotecan to colon cancer cells using epidermal growth
      factor receptor-conjugated liposomes.
PG  - 53
LID - 10.1186/s12938-022-01012-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: CPT-11 (irinotecan) is one of the most efficient agents used for
      colorectal cancer chemotherapy. However, as for many other chemotherapeutic
      drugs, how to minimize the side effects of CPT-11 still needs to be thoroughly
      described. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to develop the CPT-11-loaded DSPE-PEG
      2000 targeting EGFR liposomal delivery system and characterize its targeting
      specificity and therapeutic effect on colorectal cancer (CRC) cells in vitro and 
      in vivo. RESULTS: The synthesized liposome exhibited spherical shapes (84.6 +/-
      1.2 nm to 150.4 nm +/- 0.8 nm of estimated average sizes), good stability,
      sustained release, and enough drug loading (55.19%). For in vitro experiments,
      SW620 cells treated with CPT-11-loaded DSPE-PEG2000 targeting EGFR liposome
      showed lower survival extended level of intracellular ROS production. In
      addition, it generated an enhanced apoptotic cell rate by upregulating the
      protein expression of both cleaved-caspase-3 and cleaved-caspase-9 compared with 
      those of SW620 cells treated with free CPT-11. Importantly, the xenograft model
      showed that both the non-target and EGFR-targeted liposomes significantly
      inhibited tumor growth compared to free CPT-11. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the
      non-target CPT-11-loaded DSPE-PEG2000 liposome, CPT-11-loaded DSPE-PEG2000
      targeting EGFR liposome treatment showed much better antitumor activity in vitro 
      in vivo. Thus, our findings provide new assets and expectations for CRC targeting
      therapy.

      breast cancer: a qualitative study.
PG  - 326
LID - 10.1186/s12905-022-01906-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast cancer (BC) in women can bring various problems to their
      marital and family life. Sexual life based on the experiences of the husbands of 
      women diagnosed with BC has not been fully understood. Therefore, this research
      aimed to explore changes and challenges in sexual life experienced by the
      husbands of women diagnosed with BC. METHODS: A qualitative research was carried 
      out on 18 men whose wives had been diagnosed with BC at reproductive age. They
      were selected using purposeful sampling and were interviewed using in-depth
      semi-structured interviews. Collected data were analyzed using the conventional
      content analysis method. RESULTS: 'Sexual life suspension' was the main theme of 
      this research. Also, 'unfulfilled sexual expectations', 'perceived barriers to
      satisfy sexual expectations', and 'efforts to adapt to sexual problems' were
      subthemes. CONCLUSIONS: The husbands of women with BC need support to improve
      their sexual and marital relationships. Education and counseling about sexual
      life during the treatment of BC should be incorporated into the healthcare
      program.

LID - 10.1186/s12951-022-01526-2 [doi]
AB  - The conversion of tumor-promoting M2 macrophage phenotype to tumor-suppressing M1
      macrophages is a promising therapeutic approach for cancer treatment. However,
      the tumor normally provides an abundance of M2 macrophage stimuli, which creates 
      an M2 macrophage-dominant immunosuppressive microenvironment. In our study,
      docetaxel (DTX) as chemotherapeutic modularity was loaded into M1
      macrophage-derived exosomes (M1-Exo) with M1 proinflammatory nature to establish 
      DTX-M1-Exo drug delivery system. We found that DTX-M1-Exo induced naive M0
      macrophages to polarize to M1 phenotype, while failed to repolarize to M2
      macrophages upon Interleukin 4 restimulation due to impaired mitochondrial
      function. This suggests that DTX-M1-Exo can achieve long-term robust M1
      activation in immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The in vivo results
      further confirmed that DTX-M1-Exo has a beneficial effect on macrophage
      infiltration and activation in the tumor tissues. Thus, DTX-M1-Exo is a novel
      macrophage polarization strategy via combined chemotherapy and immunotherapy to
      achieve great antitumor therapeutic efficacy.

AB  - The CRISPR-Cas9 technology has changed the landscape of genome editing and has
      demonstrated extraordinary potential for treating otherwise incurable diseases.
      Engineering strategies to enable efficient intracellular delivery of CRISPR-Cas9 
      components has been a central theme for broadening the impact of the CRISPR-Cas9 
      technology. Various non-viral delivery systems for CRISPR-Cas9 have been
      investigated given their favorable safety profiles over viral systems. Many
      recent efforts have been focused on the development of stimuli-responsive
      non-viral CRISPR-Cas9 delivery systems, with the goal of achieving efficient and 
      precise genome editing. Stimuli-responsive nanoplatforms are capable of sensing
      and responding to particular triggers, such as innate biological cues and
      external stimuli, for controlled CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing. In this Review, we
      overview the recent advances in stimuli-responsive nanoformulations for
      CRISPR-Cas9 delivery, highlight the rationale of stimuli and formulation designs,
      and summarize their biomedical applications.

TI  - Association of lipid profile with obesity among breast cancer survivors: a
      cross-sectional study.
PG  - 66
LID - 10.1186/s12944-022-01674-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of lipid metabolism in obesity and cancer manifestations
      cannot be underestimated, but whether alterations in lipid metabolism can
      manipulate the vasculature to promote obesity among breast cancer (BC) survivors 
      is yet to be clearly understood. This study quantified plasma lipid and particle 
      sizes using high-throughput proton ((1)H) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and
      tested their associations with obesity among breast cancer (BC) survivors.
      METHODS: A total of 348 (225 premenopausal and 123 postmenopausal) BC survivors
      enrolled from five hospitals in Korea were included. We assessed thirty-four
      plasma lipid biomarkers using (1)H NMR, and obesity status was defined as a body 
      mass index (BMI) of 25 kg/m(2) or greater. Generalized linear and logistic
      regression models were applied to estimate the least-square means of BMI
      (kg/m(2)) and odds ratio (OR)s of obesity, respectively, and the corresponding
      95% confidence interval (CI)s across plasma lipid levels. RESULTS: Mean (SD)
      values of BMI was 23.3 (3.2) kg/m(2) and 90 (25.9%) had BMI of >/= 25 kg/m(2).
      BMI levels increased with increasing total triglycerides (TG), TG in lipoproteins
      and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) subfractions. However, BMI levels
      decreased with increasing tertiles of high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol 
      (C) and HDL particle size (HDL-p). Similar associations were observed in the
      logistic regression models. The increasing and decreasing BMI trends with TG and 
      HDL profiles respectively were predominantly limited to premenopausal BC
      survivors. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing levels of plasma total TG and TG in
      lipoproteins were associated with increasing levels of BMI among premenopausal BC
      survivors. High HDL-C levels and large HDL-p were inversely associated with
      obesity among premenopausal BC survivors. Due to the cross-sectional design of
      this study, longitudinal studies are necessary to examine the association between
      obesity and lipid profile among BC survivors.

TI  - Standardization of the assessment process within telerehabilitation in chronic
      diseases: a scoping meta-review.
PG  - 984
LID - 10.1186/s12913-022-08370-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Telerehabilitation (TR) interventions are receiving increasing
      attention. They have been evaluated in various scientific areas through
      systematic reviews. However, there is a lack of data on how to standardize
      assessment and report on their domains to guide researchers across studies and
      bring together the best evidence to assess TR for chronic diseases. AIMS AND
      OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to identify domains of assessment in TR and
      to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze how and when they are examined to
      gain an overview of assessment in chronic disease. METHODS: A scoping meta-review
      was carried out on 9 databases and gray literature from 2009 to 2019. The keyword
      search strategy was based on "telerehabilitation", "evaluation", "chronic
      disease" and their synonyms. All articles were subjected to qualitative analysis 
      using the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Core Model prior to further analysis
      and narrative synthesis. RESULTS: Among the 7412 identified articles, 80 studies 
      met the inclusion criteria and addressed at least one of the noncommunicable
      diseases (NCD) categories of cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular accidents),
      cancer, chronic respiratory disease, diabetes, and obesity. Regarding the domains
      of assessment, the most frequently occurring were "social aspect" (n = 63, 79%)
      (e.g., effects on behavioral changes) and "clinical efficacy" (n = 53, 66%), and 
      the least frequently occurring was "safety aspects" (n = 2, 3%). We also
      identified the phases of TR in which the assessment was conducted and found that 
      it most commonly occurred in the pilot study and randomized trial phases and
      least commonly occurred in the design, pretest, and post-implementation phases.
      CONCLUSIONS: Through the HTA model, this scoping meta-review highlighted 10
      assessment domains which have not been studied with the same degree of interest
      in the recent literature. We showed that each of these assessment domains could
      appear at different phases of TR development and proposed a new
      cross-disciplinary and comprehensive method for assessing TR interventions.
      Future studies will benefit from approaches that leverage the best evidence
      regarding the assessment of TR, and it will be interesting to extend this
      assessment framework to other chronic diseases.

TI  - The TROLLEY Study: assessing travel, health, and equity impacts of a new light
      rail transit investment during the COVID-19 pandemic.
PG  - 1475
LID - 10.1186/s12889-022-13834-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted life in extraordinary ways impacting 
      health and daily mobility. Public transit provides a strategy to improve
      individual and population health through increased active travel and reduced
      vehicle dependency, while ensuring equitable access to jobs, healthcare,
      education, and mitigating climate change. However, health safety concerns during 
      the COVID-19 pandemic eroded ridership, which could have longstanding negative
      consequences. Research is needed to understand how mobility and health change as 
      the pandemic recedes and how transit investments impact health and equity
      outcomes. METHODS: The TROLLEY (TRansit Opportunities for HeaLth, Livability,
      Exercise and EquitY) study will prospectively investigate a diverse cohort of
      university employees after the opening of a new light rail transit (LRT) line and
      the easing of campus COVID-19 restrictions. Participants are current staff who
      live either < 1 mile, 1-2 miles, or > 2 miles from LRT, with equal distribution
      across economic and racial/ethnic strata. The primary aim is to assess change in 
      physical activity, travel mode, and vehicle miles travelled using accelerometer
      and GPS devices. Equity outcomes include household transportation and
      health-related expenditures. Change in health outcomes, including depressive
      symptoms, stress, quality of life, body mass index and behavior change constructs
      related to transit use will be assessed via self-report. Pre-pandemic variables
      will be retrospectively collected. Participants will be measured at 3 times over 
      2 years of follow up. Longitudinal changes in outcomes will be assessed using
      multilevel mixed effects models. Analyses will evaluate whether proximity to LRT,
      sociodemographic, and environmental factors modify change in outcomes over time. 
      DISCUSSION: The TROLLEY study will utilize rigorous methods to advance our
      understanding of health, well-being, and equity-oriented outcomes of new LRT
      infrastructure through the COVID-19 recovery period, in a sample of
      demographically diverse adult workers whose employment location is accessed by
      new transit. Results will inform land use, transportation and health investments,
      and workplace interventions. Findings have the potential to elevate LRT as a
      public health priority and provide insight on how to ensure public transit meets 
      the needs of vulnerable users and is more resilient in the face of future health 
      pandemics. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The TROLLEY study was registered at
      ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT04940481 ) June 17, 2021, and OSF Registries (
      https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/PGEHU ) June 24, 2021, prior to participant
      enrollment.

TI  - Hospital-based evaluation of palliative care among patients with advanced
      cervical cancer: a cross-sectional study.
PG  - 140
LID - 10.1186/s12904-022-01030-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Palliative care is among the standards of care in cancer treatment
      that should be provided to those in need within the existing healthcare system.
      In Ethiopia, patients with cervical cancer experience a long wait for curative
      radiotherapy, while the level of palliative care delivery is unknown. In this
      study, we aimed to evaluate the practice of palliative care among women diagnosed
      with advanced cervical cancer. METHODS: A hospital-based cross-sectional study
      was conducted. Using a structured questionnaire, face-to-face interviews were
      made with randomly selected patients with advanced cervical cancer. Information
      on patient characteristics, medical records, and knowledge, attitude and practice
      of palliative care was captured, analysed, and presented. Data collection was
      conducted following ethical standards after obtaining approval from the hospital.
      RESULTS: A total of 385 patients were interviewed, most of whom were over 50
      years and illiterate. The patients had poor knowledge regarding comprehensive
      palliative care, a good attitude, and poor practices. Most patients either do not
      know about palliative care or consider it solely as a pain treatment. The
      patients expressed a good attitude towards palliative care; however, their
      attitude towards talking about suffering, death, and dying was poor. Almost all
      patients have received some form of palliative care. However, poor pain control, 
      inadequate education and counselling, and poor social, economic, and spiritual
      supports were documented. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with advanced cervical cancer
      expressed a good attitude but had poor knowledge and practice of comprehensive
      palliative care. The palliative care delivery needs to address the communication,
      psychosocial, economic, and spiritual components of the comprehensive palliative 
      care.

TI  - Germline variants profiling of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in Chinese Hakka breast and
      ovarian cancer patients.
PG  - 842
LID - 10.1186/s12885-022-09943-0 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence and spectrum of BRCA1 and BRCA2
      mutations in Chinese Hakka patients with breast and ovarian cancer. METHODS: A
      total of 1,664 breast or ovarian cancer patients were enrolled for genetic
      testing at our hospital. Germline mutations of the BRCA gene were analysed by
      next-generation sequencing, including the coding regions and exon intron boundary
      regions. RESULTS: The 1,664 patients included 1,415 (85.04%) breast cancer
      patients and 245 (14.72%) ovarian cancer patients, while four (0.24%) patients
      had both the breast and ovarian cancers. A total of 151 variants, including 71
      BRCA1 variants and 80 BRCA2 variants, were detected in the 234 (14.06%) patients.
      The 151 variants included 58 pathogenic variants, 8 likely pathogenic variants,
      and 85 variants of unknown significance (VUS). A total of 56.25% (18/32) and
      65.38% (17/26) of pathogenic variants (likely pathogenic variants are not
      included) were distributed in exon 14 of BRCA1 and exon 11 of BRCA2,
      respectively. The most common pathogenic variants among this Hakka population are
      c.2635G > T (p.Glu879*) (n = 7) in the BRCA1 gene and c.5164_5165del
      (p.Ser1722Tyrfs*4) (n = 7) in the BRCA2 gene among the Hakka population. A
      hotspot mutation in the Chinese population, the BRCA1 c.5470_5477del variant was 
      not found in this Hakka population. The prevalence and spectrum of variants in
      the BRCA genes in the Hakka patients are different from that in other ethnic
      groups. CONCLUSIONS: The most common pathogenic variant in this population is
      c.2635G > T in the BRCA1 gene, and c.5164_5165delAG in the BRCA2 gene in this
      population. The prevalence and spectrum of variants in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes 
      in the Hakka patients from southern China are different from those in other
      ethnic groups.

TI  - A role for ceruloplasmin in the control of human glioblastoma cell responses to
      radiation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma (GB) is the most common and most aggressive malignant
      brain tumor. In understanding its resistance to conventional treatments, iron
      metabolism and related pathways may represent a novel avenue. As for many cancer 
      cells, GB cell growth is dependent on iron, which is tightly involved in red-ox
      reactions related to radiotherapy effectiveness. From new observations indicating
      an impact of RX radiations on the expression of ceruloplasmin (CP), an important 
      regulator of iron metabolism, the aim of the present work was to study the
      functional effects of constitutive expression of CP within GB lines in response
      to beam radiation depending on the oxygen status (21% O2 versus 3% O2). METHODS
      AND RESULTS: After analysis of radiation responses (Hoechst staining, LDH
      release, Caspase 3 activation) in U251-MG and U87-MG human GB cell lines,
      described as radiosensitive and radioresistant respectively, the expression of 9 
      iron partners (TFR1, DMT1, FTH1, FTL, MFRN1, MFRN2, FXN, FPN1, CP) were tested by
      RTqPCR and western blots at 3 and 8 days following 4 Gy irradiation. Among those,
      only CP was significantly downregulated, both at transcript and protein levels in
      the two lines, with however, a weaker effect in the U87-MG, observable at 3% O2. 
      To investigate specific role of CP in GB radioresistance, U251-MG and U87-MG
      cells were modified genetically to obtain CP depleted and overexpressing cells,
      respectively. Manipulation of CP expression in GB lines demonstrated impact both 
      on cell survival and on activation of DNA repair/damage machinery (gammaH2AX);
      specifically high levels of CP led to increased production of reactive oxygen
      species, as shown by elevated levels of superoxide anion, SOD1 synthesis and
      cellular Fe2 + . CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these in vitro results indicate for
      the first time that CP plays a positive role in the efficiency of radiotherapy on
      GB cells.

TI  - Use of folic acid supplementation to halt and even reverse the progression of
      gastric precancerous conditions: a meta-analysis.
PG  - 370
LID - 10.1186/s12876-022-02390-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current data indicate that supplements such as folic acid and vitamin
      B may be beneficial in halting and even reversing atrophic gastritis, intestinal 
      metaplasia and intraepithelial neoplasia, generally referred to as gastric
      precancerous conditions(GPC). However, there is no Meta-analysis article to
      evaluate the prevention and treatment of folic acid in the gastric precancerous
      conditions. We therefore conducted a meta-analysis to confirm the efficacy of
      folic acid in treating GPC. METHODS: Using a systematic review method, consider
      randomized controlled trials (RCT), including clinical trial reports, unpublished
      clinical trial data, and conference papers. The search time was been set from the
      database's establishment to June 2, 2021. The language was not limited, using
      PubMed, SinoMed, Lancet, Web of Science, CNKI, Cochrane, Ovid, Science Direct,
      Embase, and EBSCO databases. Data were extracted using a pre-designed extraction 
      tool and analysis was undertaken using RevMan5.2.Besides,we use Origin software
      to construct the Time-dose interval analysis. RESULTS: Of the 225 records
      identified, 13 studies involving 1252 patients (including 11 clinical controlled 
      trials, 1 conference paper report and 1 unpublished research report) met the
      inclusion conditions. Folic acid dose maintained at 20-30 mg / d for 3-6 months
      may be beneficial to pathological changes of GPC. Moreover, in the 3 month
      treatment of 5 trials, the effect was more obvious when the folic acid dose was
      maintained at 30 mg / d. In the 7 trials, the symptom ineffective rate of GPC
      treated with folic acid was 32% (RR:0.32, 95% confidence interval CI:0.21-0.48), 
      which was combined using a fixed analysis model; The effect of folic acid on
      gastric mucosal atrophy in 5 trials (RR: 1.61, 95%CI 1.07-2.41). The changes of
      folic acid on intestinal metaplasia in the 2 experiments (RR: 1.77, 95% CI:
      1.32-2.37).The 2 results are combined using a fixed analytical model. However,
      the subgroup analysis of 9 trials revealed no significant effectiveness of
      symptom. CONCLUSIONS: Our research showed that folic acid supplementation brings 
      benefits in preventing and even reversing the progression of GPC in the stomach, 
      and provided evidence for its potential clinical use in management of GPC.

TI  - Bias and inconsistency in the estimation of tumour mutation burden.
PG  - 840
LID - 10.1186/s12885-022-09897-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tumour mutation burden (TMB), defined as the number of somatic
      mutations per megabase within the sequenced region in the tumour sample, has been
      used as a biomarker for predicting response to immune therapy. Several studies
      have been conducted to assess the utility of TMB for various cancer types;
      however, methods to measure TMB have not been adequately evaluated. In this
      study, we identified two sources of bias in current methods to calculate TMB.
      METHODS: We used simulated data to quantify the two sources of bias and their
      effect on TMB calculation, we down-sampled sequencing reads from exome sequencing
      datasets from TCGA to evaluate the consistency in TMB estimation across different
      sequencing depths. We analyzed data from ten cancer cohorts to investigate the
      relationship between inferred TMB and sequencing depth. RESULTS: We found that
      TMB, estimated by counting the number of somatic mutations above a threshold
      frequency (typically 0.05), is not robust to sequencing depth. Furthermore, we
      show that, because only mutations with an observed frequency greater than the
      threshold are considered, the observed mutant allele frequency provides a biased 
      estimate of the true frequency. This can result in substantial over-estimation of
      the TMB, when the cancer sample includes a large number of somatic mutations at
      low frequencies, and exacerbates the lack of robustness of TMB to variation in
      sequencing depth and tumour purity. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that care
      needs to be taken in the estimation of TMB to ensure that results are unbiased
      and consistent across studies and we suggest that accurate and robust estimation 
      of TMB could be achieved using statistical models that estimate the full mutant
      allele frequency spectrum.

TI  - Multiple roles of apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic subunit 3B
      (APOBEC3B) in human tumors: a pan-cancer analysis.
PG  - 312
LID - 10.1186/s12859-022-04862-0 [doi]
AB  - Although there have been some recent cell and animal experiments indicating that 
      expression of the gene encoding apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic
      subunit 3B (APOBEC3B) is closely related to cancer, it still lacks pan-cancer
      analysis. Here we analyzed the potential carcinogenic role of APOBEC3B in 33
      tumors based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). APOBEC3B was highly expressed in 
      most tumors and weakly expressed in a few. Differences in expression level were
      significantly correlated with the pathological tumor stage and prognosis of
      affected patients. The high-frequency APOBEC3B changes were principally mutations
      and amplifications in some tumors, such as uterine corpus endometrial carcinomas 
      or cutaneous melanomas. In testicular germ cell tumors and invasive breast
      carcinomas, APOBEC3B expression and CD8(+) T lymphocyte counts were correlated.
      In other cancers, such as human papilloma virus (HPV)-related head and neck
      squamous cell carcinomas or esophageal adenocarcinomas, there was also

TI  - Analgesic effect of ultrasound-guided erector spinae plane block (espb) in
      general anesthesia for cesarean section: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 244
LID - 10.1186/s12871-022-01781-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The analgesic effects of erector spinae plane block in general
      anesthesia for cesarean section and recovery from puerperae remain unclear.
      METHODS: Sixty patients with contraindications for spinal anesthesia who required
      general anesthesia for cesarean section were enrolled and randomly divided into
      the erector spinal plane block (ESPB) combined with the general anesthesia group 
      (group E) and general anesthesia group (group G). Group E received bilateral ESPB
      (20 ml of 0.25% ropivacaine on each side) under ultrasound guidance 30 min before
      general anesthesia. The primary outcomes were the number of patient-controlled
      intravenous analgesia (PCIA) boluses, and Bruggemann comfort scale (BCS) scores
      at 2 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h after operation. The second outcome was
      intraoperative anesthesia dosage, fetal delivery time, puerperae emergence time, 
      visual analog scale (VAS) at 2 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h after operation, and
      incidence of nausea and vomiting. Heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure
      (MAP) were recorded 10 min before the start of anesthesia (T0), at the induction 
      of anesthesia (T1), at skin incision (T2), and fetal delivery (T3), and
      immediately after surgery (T4). RESULTS: The number of PCIA boluses was lower in 
      group E than in group G (P < 0.001). The BCS score increased at 2 h and 6 h after
      the operation in group E (P < 0.05), while the VAS score significantly decreased 
      in group E at the same time (P < 0.05). Compared with group G, the doses of
      propofol and remifentanil were significantly decreased in group E (P < 0.001),
      the emergence time of puerperae was shortened (P = 0.003), and the incidence of
      nausea and vomiting was significantly decreased (P = 0.014). CONCLUSION:
      Ultrasound-guided ESPB applied to general anesthesia for a cesarean section can
      significantly reduce the required dose of general anesthetic drugs, shorten the
      recovery time of the puerperae, and improve postoperative analgesia. TRIAL

TI  - In silico design of a multi-epitope vaccine against HPV16/18.
PG  - 311
LID - 10.1186/s12859-022-04784-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer affecting women and 
      is caused by human Papillomavirus (HPV) infections that are sexually transmitted.
      There are currently commercially available prophylactic vaccines that have been
      shown to protect vaccinated individuals against HPV infections, however, these
      vaccines have no therapeutic effects for those who are previously infected with
      the virus. The current study's aim was to use immunoinformatics to develop a
      multi-epitope vaccine with therapeutic potential against cervical cancer.
      RESULTS: In this study, T-cell epitopes from E5 and E7 proteins of HPV16/18 were 
      predicted. These epitopes were evaluated and chosen based on their antigenicity, 
      allergenicity, toxicity, and induction of IFN-gamma production (only in helper T 
      lymphocytes). Then, the selected epitopes were sequentially linked by appropriate
      linkers. In addition, a C-terminal fragment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis heat
      shock protein 70 (HSP70) was used as an adjuvant for the vaccine construct. The
      physicochemical parameters of the vaccine construct were acceptable. Furthermore,
      the vaccine was soluble, highly antigenic, and non-allergenic. The vaccine's 3D
      model was predicted, and the structural improvement after refinement was
      confirmed using the Ramachandran plot and ProSA-web. The vaccine's B-cell
      epitopes were predicted. Molecular docking analysis showed that the vaccine's
      refined 3D model had a strong interaction with the Toll-like receptor 4. The
      structural stability of the vaccine construct was confirmed by molecular dynamics
      simulation. Codon adaptation was performed in order to achieve efficient vaccine 
      expression in Escherichia coli strain K12 (E. coli). Subsequently, in silico
      cloning of the multi-epitope vaccine was conducted into pET-28a ( +) expression
      vector. CONCLUSIONS: According to the results of bioinformatics analyses, the
      multi-epitope vaccine is structurally stable, as well as a non-allergic and
      non-toxic antigen. However, in vitro and in vivo studies are needed to validate
      the vaccine's efficacy and safety. If satisfactory results are obtained from in
      vitro and in vivo studies, the vaccine designed in this study may be effective as
      a therapeutic vaccine against cervical cancer.

LID - 10.1007/s10585-022-10177-4 [doi]
AB  - The ability to noninvasively detect and monitor the growth of orthotopic liver
      transplantation tumors is critical for replicating advanced colorectal cancer
      liver metastases (CRLMs) in animal models. We assessed the use of high-resolution
      ultrasound (HRU) to monitor CRLMs transplanted using various cell concentrations.
      Sixty BALB/c female mice were randomly divided into 3 groups, and murine colonic 
      CT26 cells were injected into the left liver lobe at concentrations of 1 x 10(2) 
      (group 1), 1 x 10(3) (group 2), or 1 x 10(4) (group 3). Tumor presentation,
      location, number, size, shape, and echogenicity were assessed daily with 24-MHz
      center frequency HRU starting 6 days after injection. Animals were sacrificed
      when the largest tumor was >/= 1 cm in diameter. Sensitivity, specificity, and
      area under curve (AUC) of CRLMs diagnosed with HRU were calculated using receiver
      operating characteristic curve analysis. In group 1, 94% of mice formed < 5
      tumors, and 41% formed a single tumor. Tumors were first detected with HRU on day
      12 in group 1, day 10 in group 2, and day 7 in group 3; tumor volume doubling
      times were 14-15 days, 11-12 days, and 7-8 days, respectively. With a long
      diameter threshold of 2.4 mm, diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of HRU were 
      94.1% and 88.7%, respectively, and the AUC was 0.962. These findings suggest that
      HRU can be used to accurately detect and monitor the growth of CRLMs in an
      orthotopic transplantation mouse model, especially when a lower concentration of 
      cells is used.

TI  - Long Non-Coding RNA LINC00052 Targets miR-548p/Notch2/Pyk2 to Modulate Tumor
      Budding and Metastasis of Human Breast Cancer.
LID - 10.1007/s10528-022-10255-y [doi]
AB  - Abnormal expression of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) is involved in many
      pathological processes of cancers. However, the role of lncRNA LINC00052 in
      breast cancer progression is still unclear. Here, LINC00052 expression was
      detected by in situ hybridization and quantitative real-time PCR assays. Cell
      Counting Kit-8, wound healing, and transwell assays were used to investigate
      changes in the proliferation, migration, and invasion of breast cancer cells.
      MiR-548p was found associated with LINC00052 or Notch2 by RNA pull-down,
      dual-luciferase reporter, and qRT-PCR assays. The effect of LINC00052 on lung
      metastasis was explored through in vivo experiments. High LINC00052 expression
      was observed in breast cancer tissues and cells. LINC00052 silencing inhibited
      the proliferation, migration, and invasion of MCF7 cells, and LINC00052
      overexpression produced the opposite results. MiR-548p, a target gene of
      LINC00052, partially rescued the effects of LINC00052 on proliferation,
      migration, and invasion of MCF7. Notch2 was the target of miR-548p and LINC00052 
      could promote Notch2 expression. Moreover, the phosphorylation of proline-rich
      tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2), a downstream factor of Notch2, was increased by
      LINC00052, and a Pyk2 mutant could inhibit the cell migration and invasion
      induced by LINC00052 overexpression in MDA-MB-468 cells, which was similar to the
      function of the miR-548p mimic. We further demonstrated that LINC00052
      exacerbated the metastases of breast cancer cells in vivo. Our research
      demonstrated that LINC00052 is highly expressed in breast cancer and promotes
      breast cancer proliferation, migration, and invasion via the miR-548p/Notch2/Pyk2
      axis. LINC00052 could serve as a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer.

AB  - Against the backdrop of hidden symptoms of diseases and limited medical resources
      of their investigation, in vitro diagnosis has become a popular mode of real-time
      healthcare monitoring. Electrochemical biosensors have considerable potential for
      use in wearable products since they can consistently monitor the physiological
      information of the patient. This review classifies and briefly compares commonly 
      available electrochemical biosensors and the techniques of detection used.
      Following this, the authors focus on recent studies and applications of various
      types of sensors based on a variety of methods to detect common compounds and
      cancer biomarkers in humans. The primary gaps in research are discussed and
      strategies for improvement are proposed along the dimensions of hardware and
      software. The work here provides new guidelines for advanced research on and a
      wider scope of applications of electrochemical biosensors to in vitro diagnosis.

TI  - Two-Wave Variable Nanotheranostic Agents for Dual-Mode Imaging-Guided
      Photo-Induced Triple-Therapy for Cancer.
PG  - e2201834
LID - 10.1002/advs.202201834 [doi]
AB  - Photothermal therapy (PTT) is a promising strategy for cancer treatment, but its 
      clinical application relies heavily on accurate tumor positioning and effective
      combination. Nanotheranostics has shown superior application in precise tumor
      positioning and treatment, bringing potential opportunities for developing novel 
      PTT-based therapies. Here, a nanotheranostic agent is proposed to enhance
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/ near-infrared fluorescence imaging (NIRFI)
      imaging-guided photo-induced triple-therapy for cancer. Thermosensitive liposomes
      co-loaded with SPIONs/IR780 and Abemaciclib (SIA-TSLs), peptide ACKFRGD, and
      click group 2-cyano-6-amino-benzothiazole (CABT) are co-modified on the surface
      of SIA-TSLs to form SIA-alphaTSLs. ACKFRGD can be hydrolyzed to expose the 1,
      2-thiolamino groups in the presence of cathepsin B in tumors, which click
      cycloaddition with the cyano group on CABT, resulting in the formation of
      SIA-alphaTSLs aggregates. The aggregation of SIA-alphaTSLs in tumors enhances the
      MRI/NIRFI imaging capability and enables precise PTT. Photo-induced
      triple-therapy enhances precision cancer therapy. First, PTT ablates specific
      tumors and induces ICD via localized photothermal. Second, local tumor heating
      promotes the rupture of SIA-alphaTSLs, which release Abemaciclib to block the
      tumor cell cycle and inhibit Tregs proliferation. Third, injecting GM-CSF into
      tumor tissue leads to recruitment of dendritic cells and initiation of antitumor 
      immunity. Collectively, these results present a promising nanotheranostic
      strategy for future cancer therapy.

AB  - Males exhibit higher incidence and worse prognosis for the majority of cancers,
      including glioblastoma (GBM). Disparate survival may be related to sex-biased
      responses to treatment, including radiation. Using a mouse model of GBM, we show 
      that female cells are more sensitive to radiation, and that senescence represents
      a major component of the radiation therapeutic response in both sexes.
      Correlation analyses revealed that the CDK inhibitor p21 and irradiation induced 
      senescence were differentially regulated between male and female cells. Indeed,
      female cellular senescence was more sensitive to changes in p21 levels, a finding
      that was observed in wildtype and transformed murine astrocytes, as well as
      patient-derived GBM cell lines. Using a novel Four Core Genotypes model of GBM,
      we further show that sex differences in p21-induced senescence are patterned
      during early development by gonadal sex. These data provide a rationale for the
      further study of sex differences in radiation response and how senescence might
      be enhanced for radiation sensitization. The determination that p21 and gonadal
      sex are required for sex differences in radiation response will serve as a
      foundation for these future mechanistic studies.

TI  - Expression pattern and clinical significance of beta 2-adrenergic receptor in
      oral squamous cell carcinoma: an emerging prognostic indicator and future
      therapeutic target.
LID - 10.1007/s12094-022-02879-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Beta 2-Adrenergic Receptor (beta2-AR) is significantly overexpressed in 
      various types of malignancies, which is associated with the worst prognosis.
      However, the role of beta2-AR in oral cancer is not well identified. The present 
      study aimed at investigating the beta2-AR gene expression and its significance in
      relation with the clinicopathological features and overall survival of oral
      squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry, western
      blot and quantitative real-time PCR techniques were used to analyze beta2-AR
      protein and mRNA levels in a total of 65 histopathologically confirmed OSCC
      tissues (case group) and 65 normal tissues (control group) from the oral cavity. 
      RESULTS: Out of the total of 65 OSCC tissues, 41 tissues (63.1%) exhibited high
      expression for beta2-AR protein. Percent positivity and relative density (mean
      +/- SD) of protein were higher in the case group as compared to the control group
      (positivity 40.31 +/- 3.01 vs. 20.46 +/- 1.93, p < 0.001; density 2.77 +/- 1.17
      vs. 1.28 +/- 0.37, p < 0.001). In addition, beta2-AR mRNA level was also
      upregulated in patients compared to the controls (2.36 +/- 1.30 vs. 1.09 +/-
      0.42, p < 0.001) and showed a positive correlation with immunostaining of protein
      in OSCC (r = 0.48, p = 0.011). High beta2-AR protein expression was significantly
      associated with multiple risk habits (p = 0.045), histological differentiation (p
      = 0.013), clinical TNM stages (p = 0.014), and poor survival (p = 0.006) of
      patients. In the Cox proportional hazards model, beta2-AR was identified as a
      prognostic biomarker of OSCC (p = 0.047). CONCLUSION: beta2-AR protein level is
      identified as an independent significant prognostic factor in patients with oral 
      carcinoma.

AB  - Pancreatoscopy plays a significant role in the diagnosis and treatment of
      pancreatic diseases. However, the risk of pancreatoscopy is remarkably greater
      than that of other endoscopic procedures, such as gastroscopy and bronchoscopy,
      owing to its severe invasiveness. In comparison, virtual pancreatoscopy (VP) has 
      shown notable advantages. However, because of the low resolution of current
      computed tomography (CT) technology and the small diameter of the pancreatic
      duct, VP has limited clinical use. In this study, an optimal path algorithm and
      super-resolution technique are investigated for the development of an open-source
      software platform for VP based on 3D Slicer. The proposed segmentation of the
      pancreatic duct from the abdominal CT images reached an average Dice coefficient 
      of 0.85 with a standard deviation of 0.04. Owing to the excellent segmentation
      performance, a fly-through visualization of both the inside and outside of the
      duct was successfully reconstructed, thereby demonstrating the feasibility of VP.
      In addition, a quantitative analysis of the wall thickness and topology of the
      duct provides more insight into pancreatic diseases than a fly-through
      visualization. The entire VP system developed in this study is available at
      https://github.com/gaoyi/VirtualEndoscopy.git .

TI  - Triclosan-coated barbed sutures in elective laparoscopic colorectal cancer
      surgery: a propensity score matched cohort study.
LID - 10.1007/s00464-022-09418-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most of the studies published to date which assess the role of
      antibacterial sutures in surgical site infection (SSI) prevention include
      heterogeneous groups of patients, and it is therefore difficult to draw
      conclusions. The objective of the present study was to investigate whether the
      use of Triclosan-coated barbed sutures (TCBS) was associated with a lower
      incidence of incisional SSI and lower duration of hospital stay compared to
      standard sutures, in elective laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery. METHOD:
      Observational including patients who underwent elective colorectal cancer
      laparoscopic surgery between January 2015 and December 2020. The patients were
      divided into two groups according to the suture used for fascial closure of the
      extraction incision, TCBS vs conventional non-coated sutures (CNCS), and the rate
      of SSI was analysed. The TCBS cases were matched to CNCS cases by propensity
      score matching to obtain comparable groups of patients. RESULTS: 488 patients met
      the inclusion criteria. After adjusting the patients with the propensity score,
      two new groups of patients were generated: 143 TCBS cases versus 143 CNCS cases. 
      Overall incisional SSI appeared in 16 (5.6%) of the patients with a significant
      difference between groups depending on the type of suture used, 9.8% in the group
      of CNCS and 1.4% in the group of TCBS (OR 0.239 (CI 95%: 0.065-0.880)). Hospital 
      stay was significantly shorter in TCBS group than in CNCS, 5 vs 6 days (p <
      0.001). CONCLUSION: TCBS was associated with a lower incidence of incisional SSI 
      compared to standard sutures in a cohort of patients undergoing elective
      laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery.

TI  - Minors at risk of von Hippel-Lindau disease: 10 years' experience of predictive
      genetic testing and follow-up adherence.
LID - 10.1038/s41431-022-01157-z [doi]
AB  - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is one of the most common cancer predisposition
      syndromes. Penetrance is high with around 20% of children presenting detectable
      and curable manifestations of the disease at 15 years old. VHL predictive genetic
      testing (PGT) is recommended during childhood from age 5 years in France.
      Insufficient compliance to surveillance of VHL pathogenic variant (PV) carriers
      is associated with severe outcome. PGT experienced by children and their parents 
      is probably critical in influencing future acceptance of the result and adherence
      to surveillance. We conducted a retrospective study on minors tested (aged 5 to
      16 years old) from 2010 to 2020, in a multidisciplinary oncogenetics consultation
      which follows a 3-step protocol based on psychological familial support. The
      objectives were to assess the adherence to follow-up within the National Expert
      Center for inherited predispositions to renal tumors (PREDIR) network of VHL PV
      carriers and its benefit through tumor detection and medical interventions. A VHL
      PGT was carried out in 34 children. Among the 16 children diagnosed as VHL PV
      carriers addressed to the PREDIR network, none had discontinued surveillance
      after a median of 41 months. Follow-up examinations detected 11 tumors in 6
      children, 4 have been surgically treated. All had a favorable outcome. Our data
      suggest that a specific and adapted procedure for PGT in at-risk VHL children as 
      well as a follow-up, organized within a specialized expert network, fosters a
      complete adherence to the surveillance protocol and thus lead to a favorable
      clinical outcome.

TI  - Biochemical and mechanical regulation of actin dynamics.
LID - 10.1038/s41580-022-00508-4 [doi]
AB  - Polymerization of actin filaments against membranes produces force for numerous
      cellular processes, such as migration, morphogenesis, endocytosis, phagocytosis
      and organelle dynamics. Consequently, aberrant actin cytoskeleton dynamics are
      linked to various diseases, including cancer, as well as immunological and
      neurological disorders. Understanding how actin filaments generate forces in
      cells, how force production is regulated by the interplay between actin-binding
      proteins and how the actin-regulatory machinery responds to mechanical load are
      at the heart of many cellular, developmental and pathological processes. During
      the past few years, our understanding of the mechanisms controlling actin
      filament assembly and disassembly has evolved substantially. It has also become
      evident that the activities of key actin-binding proteins are not regulated
      solely by biochemical signalling pathways, as mechanical regulation is critical
      for these proteins. Indeed, the architecture and dynamics of the actin
      cytoskeleton are directly tuned by mechanical load. Here we discuss the general
      mechanisms by which key actin regulators, often in synergy with each other,
      control actin filament assembly, disassembly, and monomer recycling. By using an 
      updated view of actin dynamics as a framework, we discuss how the mechanics and
      geometry of actin networks control actin-binding proteins, and how this
      translates into force production in endocytosis and mesenchymal cell migration.

TI  - An international study evaluating the epidemiology of intracranial germ cell
      tumors in the native versus immigrant Japanese populations: the need for an
      international registry.
LID - 10.1007/s11060-022-04094-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pediatric intra-cranial germ cell tumors (iGCTs) occur at an
      incidence of 0.6-1.2 cases/million/year in Western countries. The incidence is
      reported up to 5 times higher in Japan. It is unknown whether this increased
      incidence is due to genetic predisposition or environment. METHODS: The incidence
      of iGCTs in children ages 0-19 years was evaluated from December 1st,
      1996-December 1st, 2016 in stable Japanese immigrant populations living abroad
      and compared to current native Japanese registry data. The incidence of
      medullobblastoma was used as a control to account for assumptions in the data.
      Sites were identified based on historical and population data of known large
      scale emigration from Japan during a period of industrialization from 1868-1912
      which resulted in large, stable Japanese immigrant populations abroad. These
      three representative sites included Lima, Peru, San Paolo, Brazil, and Vancouver,
      Canada. Data was collected from registry and hospital-based resources within each
      region. RESULTS: A review of the Brain Tumor Registry of Japan from 1984-2004
      revealed an incidence of 2.5 cases/million/year, lower than previously reported, 
      and a lower incidence of medulloblastoma at 1.2 cases/million/year. Data from
      Vancouver, Canada, Lima, Peru, and San Paolo, Brazil included a total population 
      of 731,174 Japanese persons. The ratio of all medulloblastoma to iGCT cases in
      Japan was identified as 1:2 while the ratio was 2:1, 6.5:1, and 5:1,
      respectively, in the other three locations. The data suggests increased incidence
      in native Japan may not translate to higher incidence in immigrant Japanese
      populations abroad and a clear genetic component was not found in our data set.
      CONCLUSIONS: A more precise and comprehensive study is needed to determine the
      cause of this difference in incidence. This study also emphasizes the importance 
      of national and state registries and is a call to collaborate on state and
      country level epidemiology studies.

TI  - Identification of the immune subtype of ovarian cancer patients by integrated
      analyses of transcriptome and single-cell sequencing data.

AB  - Ovarian cancer (OC) is one the most life-threatening cancers affecting women's
      health worldwide. Immunotherapy has become a promising treatment for a variety of
      cancers, but the therapeutic effects in OC remain limited. In this study, we
      constructed a macrophage risk score (MRS) based on M1 and M2 macrophages and a
      gene risk score (GRS) based on the prognostic genes associated with MRS. Next,
      cell-cell communication analysis was performed using single-cell RNA (scRNA)
      sequencing data. Survival status and immune characteristics were compared between
      the high- and low-score groups separated by MRS or GRS. Our results suggested
      that MRS and GRS can identify the immune subtypes of OC patients with better
      overall survival (OS) and inflammatory immune microenvironment. Moreover, M1 and 
      M2 macrophages may affect the prognosis of OC patients through signal
      communication with CD8 T cells. Finally, functional differences between the two
      groups separated by GRS were elucidated. Taken together, this study constructed
      two useful models for the identification of immune subtypes in OC, which has a
      better prognosis and may have a sensitive response to immune checkpoint
      inhibitors (ICIs). The hub genes for the construction of GRS may be potential
      synergetic targets for immunotherapy in OC patients.

TI  - Arylamine N-acetyltransferase 1 deficiency inhibits drug-induced cell death in
      breast cancer cells: switch from cytochrome C-dependent apoptosis to necroptosis.
LID - 10.1007/s10549-022-06668-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Arylamine N-acetyltransferase 1 (NAT1) deficiency has been associated
      with drug resistance and poor outcomes in breast cancer patients. The current
      study aimed to investigate drug resistance in vitro using normal breast cancer
      cell lines and NAT1-deficient cell lines to understand the changes induced by the
      lack of NAT1 that resulted in poor drug response. METHODS: The response to seven 
      chemotherapeutic agents was quantified following NAT1 deletion using CRISPR-Cas 9
      in MDA-MB-231 and T-47D cells. Apoptosis was monitored by annexin V staining and 
      caspase 3/7 activity. Cytochrome C release and caspase 8 and 9 activities were
      measured by Western blots. Caspase 8 was inhibited using Z-IETD-FMK and
      necroptosis was inhibited using necrostatin and necrosulfonamide. RESULTS:
      Compared to parental cells, NAT1 depleted cells were resistant to drug treatment.
      This could be reversed following NAT1 rescue of the NAT1 deleted cells. Release
      of cytochrome C in response to treatment was decreased in the NAT1 depleted
      cells, suggesting suppression of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. In addition,
      NAT1 knockout resulted in a decrease in caspase 8 activation. Treatment with
      necrosulfonamide showed that NAT1 deficient cells switched from intrinsic
      apoptosis to necroptosis when treated with the anti-cancer drug cisplatin.
      CONCLUSIONS: NAT1 deficiency can switch cell death from apoptosis to necroptosis 
      resulting in decreased response to cytotoxic drugs. The absence of NAT1 in
      patient tumours may be a useful biomarker for selecting alternative treatments in
      a subset of breast cancer patients.

TI  - National, sub-national, and risk-attributed burden of thyroid cancer in Iran from
      1990 to 2019.
PG  - 13231
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-17115-0 [doi]
AB  - An updated exploration of the burden of thyroid cancer across a country is always
      required for making correct decisions. The objective of this study is to present 
      the thyroid cancer burden and attributed burden to the high Body Mass Index (BMI)
      in Iran at national and sub-national levels from 1990 to 2019. The data was
      obtained from the GBD 2019 study estimates. To explain the pattern of changes in 
      incidence from 1990 to 2019, decomposition analysis was conducted. Besides, the
      attribution of high BMI in the thyroid cancer DALYs and deaths were obtained. The
      age-standardized incidence rate of thyroid cancer was 1.57 (95% UI: 1.33-1.86) in
      1990 and increased 131% (53-191) until 2019. The age-standardized prevalence rate
      of thyroid cancer was 30.19 (18.75-34.55) in 2019 which increased 164% (77-246)
      from 11.44 (9.38-13.85) in 1990. In 2019, the death rate, and Disability-adjusted
      life years of thyroid cancer was 0.49 (0.36-0.53), and 13.16 (8.93-14.62),
      respectively. These numbers also increased since 1990. The DALYs and deaths
      attributable to high BMI was 1.91 (0.95-3.11) and 0.07 (0.04-0.11), respectively.
      The thyroid cancer burden and high BMI attributed burden has increased from 1990 
      to 2019 in Iran. This study and similar studies' results can be used for accurate
      resource allocation for efficient management and all potential risks'
      modification for thyroid cancer with a cost-conscious view.

AB  - Mitochondrial dysfunction promotes cancer aggressiveness, metastasis, and
      resistance to therapy. Similar traits are associated with epithelial mesenchymal 
      transition (EMT). We questioned whether mitochondrial dysfunction induces EMT in 
      head and neck cancer (HNC) cell lines. We induced mitochondrial dysfunction in
      four HNC cell lines with carbonyl cyanide-4(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone
      (FCCP), a mitochondrial electron transport chain uncoupling agent, and
      oligomycin, a mitochondrial ATP synthase inhibitor. Extracellular flux analyses
      and expression of the cystine/glutamate antiporter system xc (xCT) served to
      confirm mitochondrial dysfunction. Expression of the EMT-related transcription
      factor SNAI2, the mesenchymal marker vimentin and vimentin/cytokeratin double
      positivity served to detect EMT. In addition, holotomographic microscopy was used
      to search for morphological features of EMT. Extracellular flux analysis and xCT 
      expression confirmed that FCCP/oligomycin induced mitochondrial dysfunction in
      all cell lines. Across the four cell lines, mitochondrial dysfunction resulted in
      an increase in relative SNAI2 expression from 8.5 +/- 0.8 to 12.0 +/- 1.1 (mean
      +/- SEM; p = 0.007). This effect was predominantly caused by the CAL 27 cell line
      (increase from 2.2 +/- 0.4 to 5.5 +/- 1.0; p < 0.001). Similarly, only in CAL 27 
      cells vimentin expression increased from 2.2 +/- 0.5 x 10(-3) to 33.2 +/- 10.2 x 
      10(-3) (p = 0.002) and vimentin/cytokeratin double positive cells increased from 
      34.7 +/- 5.1 to 67.5 +/- 9.8% (p = 0.003), while the other 3 cell lines did not
      respond with EMT (all p > 0.1). Across all cell lines, FCCP/oligomycin had no
      effect on EMT characteristics in holotomographic microscopy. Mitochondrial
      dysfunction induced EMT in 1 of 4 HNC cell lines. Given the heterogeneity of HNC,
      mitochondrial dysfunction may be sporadically induced by EMT, but EMT does not
      explain the tumor promoting effects of mitochondrial dysfunction in general.

      cells.
PG  - 776

AB  - Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are produced from the blood vessel walls and
      circulate in the blood during the perinatal period. However, the migration
      dynamics of how HSCs enter the bone marrow remain elusive. To observe the
      dynamics of HSCs over time, the present study develops an intravital imaging
      method to visualize bone marrow in neonatal long bones formed by endochondral
      ossification which is essential for HSC niche formation. Endogenous HSCs are
      labeled with tdTomato under the control of an HSC marker gene Hlf, and a
      customized imaging system with a bone penetrating laser is developed for
      intravital imaging of tdTomato-labeled neonatal HSCs in undrilled tibia, which is
      essential to avoid bleeding from fragile neonatal tibia by bone drilling. The
      migration speed of neonatal HSCs is higher than that of adult HSCs. Neonatal HSCs
      migrate from outside to inside the tibia via the blood vessels that penetrate the
      bone, which is a transient structure during the neonatal period, and settle on
      the blood vessel wall in the bone marrow. The results obtained from direct
      observations in vivo reveal the motile dynamics and colonization process of
      neonatal HSCs during bone marrow formation.

AB  - One new xanthene derivative, named penicixanthene E (1), together with one known 
      compound 2, was isolated from the EtOAc extract of the endophytic fungus
      Penicillium sp. GXIMD 03101, which was identified from the mangrove Acanthus
      ilicifolius L. collected in the South China Sea. The structure of 1 was
      elucidated by 1D and 2D NMR spectral interpretation and HREISMS data. The
      absolute configurations of C-9 and C-11 in 1 were proposed based on electronic
      circular dichroism (ECD), but the configuration at C-3 in 1 was unassigned.
      Compound 1 represents a xanthene derivative that was first reported, in which
      carbon-carbon double bond has been reduced. The cytotoxic activities of all
      compounds were evaluated, the result showed that compound 1 has weak activity
      against pancreatic cancer SW1990.

TI  - Sorbitan Monolaurate-Containing Liposomes Enhance Skin Cancer Cell Cytotoxicity
      and in Association with Microneedling Increase the Skin Penetration of
      5-Fluorouracil.
PG  - 212
LID - 10.1208/s12249-022-02356-z [doi]
AB  - Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) represents 20% of cases of non-melanoma skin
      cancer, and the most common treatment is the removal of the tumor, which can
      leave large scars. 5-Fluorouracil (5FU) is a drug used in the treatment of SCC,
      but it is highly hydrophilic, resulting in poor skin penetration in topical
      treatment. Some strategies can be used to increase the cutaneous penetration of
      the drug, such as the combination of liposomes containing penetration enhancers, 
      for instance, surfactants, associated with the use of microneedling. Thus, the
      present work addresses the development of liposomes with penetration enhancers,
      such as sorbtitan monolaurate, span 20, for topical application of 5-FU and
      associated or not with the use of microneedling for skin delivery. Liposomes were
      developed using the lipid film hydration, resulting in particle size,
      polydispersity index, zeta potential, and 5-FU encapsulation efficiency of 88.08 
      nm, 0.169, -12.3 mV, and 50.20%, respectively. The presence of span 20 in
      liposomes potentiated the in vitro release of 5-FU. MTT assay was employed for
      cytotoxicity evaluation and the IC50 values were 0.62, 30.52, and 24.65 muM for
      liposomes with and without span 20 and 5-FU solution, respectively after 72-h
      treatment. Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy analysis evidenced high cell
      uptake for the formulations. In skin penetration studies, a higher concentration 
      of 5-FU was observed in the epidermis + dermis, corresponding to 1997.71,
      1842.20, and 2585.49 ng/cm(2) in the passive penetration and 3214.07, 2342.84,
      and 5018.05 ng/cm(2) after pretreatment with microneedles, for solution, liposome
      without and with span 20, respectively. Therefore, herein, we developed a
      nanoformulation for 5-FU delivery, with suitable physicochemical characteristics,
      potent skin cancer cytotoxicity, and cellular uptake. Span 20-based liposomes
      increased the skin penetration of 5-FU in association of microneedling.
      Altogether, the results shown herein evidenced the potential of the liposome
      containing span 20 for topical delivery of 5-FU.

TI  - MDFNet: application of multimodal fusion method based on skin image and clinical 
      data to skin cancer classification.
LID - 10.1007/s00432-022-04180-1 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Skin cancer is one of the ten most common cancer types in the world.
      Early diagnosis and treatment can effectively reduce the mortality of patients.
      Therefore, it is of great significance to develop an intelligent diagnosis system
      for skin cancer. According to the survey, at present, most intelligent diagnosis 
      systems of skin cancer only use skin image data, but the multi-modal cross-fusion
      analysis using image data and patient clinical data is limited. Therefore, to
      further explore the complementary relationship between image data and patient
      clinical data, we propose multimode data fusion diagnosis network (MDFNet), a
      framework for skin cancer based on data fusion strategy. METHODS: MDFNet
      establishes an effective mapping among heterogeneous data features, effectively
      fuses clinical skin images and patient clinical data, and effectively solves the 
      problems of feature paucity and insufficient feature richness that only use
      single-mode data. RESULTS: The experimental results present that our proposed
      smart skin cancer diagnosis model has an accuracy of 80.42%, which is an
      improvement of about 9% compared with the model accuracy using only medical
      images, thus effectively confirming the unique fusion advantages exhibited by
      MDFNet. CONCLUSIONS: This illustrates that MDFNet can not only be applied as an
      effective auxiliary diagnostic tool for skin cancer diagnosis, help physicians
      improve clinical decision-making ability and effectively improve the efficiency
      of clinical medicine diagnosis, but also its proposed data fusion method fully
      exerts the advantage of information convergence and has a certain reference value
      for the intelligent diagnosis of numerous clinical diseases.

TI  - Clinical application of next-generation sequencing-based monitoring of minimal
      residual disease in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
LID - 10.1007/s00432-022-04151-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is an emerging technology that can
      comprehensively assess the diversity of the immune system. We explored the
      feasibility of NGS in detecting minimal residual disease (MRD) in childhood acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) based on immunoglobulin and T cell receptor.
      METHODS: Bone marrow samples were collected pre- and post-treatment with
      pediatric ALL admitted to Shenzhen Children's Hospital from February 1st, 2020 to
      January 31st, 2021. We analyzed the MRD detected by NGS, multiparametric flow
      cytometry (MFC) and real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR), and analyzed risk
      factors of positive NGS-MRD at the end of B-ALL induction chemotherapy. RESULTS: 
      A total of paired 236 bone marrow samples were collected from 64 children with
      ALL (58 B-ALL and 6 T-ALL). The decrease in the clonal rearrangement frequency of
      IGH, IGK, and IGL was generally consistent after treatment. Positive MRD was
      detected in 57.5% (77/134) of B-ALL and 80% (12/15) of T-ALL by NGS after
      chemotherapy, which was higher than those detected by MFC and RQ-PCR. In B-ALL
      patients, MRD results detected by NGS were consistent with MFC (r = 0.708, p <
      0.001) and RQ-PCR (r = 0.618, p < 0.001). At the end of induction, NGS-MRD of
      40.4% B-ALL was > 0.01% and multivariate analysis indicated that >==2 clonal
      rearrangement sequences before treatment were an independent factor of negative
      NGS-MRD. CONCLUSIONS: NGS is more sensitive than MFC and RQ-PCR for MRD
      measurement. B-ALL children with >==2 clonal rearrangements detected by NGS
      before treatment are difficult to switch to negative MRD after chemotherapy.

TI  - Oncologic Safety and Efficacy of Cell-Assisted Lipotransfer for Breast
      Reconstruction in a Murine Model of Residual Breast Cancer.
LID - 10.1007/s00266-022-03021-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cell-assisted lipotransfer (CAL) is a novel technique for fat
      grafting that combines the grafting of autologous fat and adipose-derived stromal
      cells (ASCs) to enhance fat graft retention; however, its oncologic safety is
      controversial. METHODS: Herein, we investigated the oncologic safety of CAL for
      breast reconstruction using a murine model of residual breast cancer. Various
      concentrations of 4T1 cells (murine breast cancer cells) were injected into
      female mastectomized BALB/c mice to determine the appropriate concentration for
      injection. One week after injection, mice were divided into control (100 muL
      fat), low CAL (2.5 x 10(5) ASCs/100 muL fat), and high CAL (1.0 x 10(6) ASCs/100 
      muL fat) groups, and fat grafting was performed. The injection of 5.0 x 10(3) 4T1
      cells was appropriate to produce a murine model of residual breast cancer.
      RESULTS: The weight of the fat tumor mass was significantly higher in the high
      CAL group than in the other groups (p < 0.05). However, the estimated tumor
      weight was not significantly different between the groups. Additionally, the fat 
      graft survival rate was significantly higher in the high CAL group than in the
      control and low CAL groups (p < 0.05). No significant difference was noted in the
      percentage of Ki-67-positive cells, suggesting that tumor proliferation was not
      significantly different between the groups. CONCLUSION: In summary, CAL
      significantly improved fat graft survival without affecting tumor size and
      proliferation in a murine model of residual breast cancer. These results
      highlight the oncologic safety of CAL for breast reconstruction. NO LEVEL

TI  - Role of Radioembolization in Metastatic Neuroendocrine Tumors.
LID - 10.1007/s00270-022-03206-y [doi]
AB  - The liver is the most common site of metastasis for neuroendocrine tumors
      originating from the gastrointestinal tract. Neuroendocrine liver metastases
      (NELMs) portend a worsening clinical course, making local management important.
      Local treatment options include surgery, thermal ablation, and trans-catheter
      intra-arterial therapies, such as radioembolization. Radioembolization is
      generally preferred over other embolotherapies in patients with colonized biliary
      systems. Current best practice involves personalized treatment planning,
      optimizing tumor radiation absorbed dose and minimizing radiation to the normal
      hepatic parenchyma. As part of a multidisciplinary approach, radioembolization is
      a versatile embolotherapy offering neoadjuvant, palliative, and ablative
      treatment options for patients with NELMs.

TI  - Discovery and identification of a novel small molecule BCL-2 inhibitor that binds
      to the BH4 domain.
LID - 10.1038/s41401-022-00936-0 [doi]
AB  - The B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) protein family plays a pivotal role in regulating
      the apoptosis process. BCL-2, as an antiapoptotic protein in this family,
      mediates apoptosis resistance and is an ideal target for cell death strategies in
      cancer therapy. Traditional treatment modalities target BCL-2 by occupying the
      hydrophobic pocket formed by BCL-2 homology (BH) domains 1-3, while in recent
      years, the BH4 domain of BCL-2 has also been considered an attractive novel
      target. Herein, we describe the discovery and identification of DC-B01, a novel
      BCL-2 inhibitor targeting the BH4 domain, through virtual screening combined with
      biophysical and biochemical methods. Our results from surface plasmon resonance
      and cellular thermal shift assay confirmed that the BH4 domain is responsible for
      the interaction between BCL-2 and DC-B01. As evidenced by further cell-based
      experiments, DC-B01 induced cell killing in a BCL-2-dependent manner and
      triggered apoptosis via the mitochondria-mediated pathway. DC-B01 disrupted the
      BCL-2/c-Myc interaction and consequently suppressed the transcriptional activity 
      of c-Myc. Moreover, DC-B01 inhibited tumor growth in vivo in a BCL2dependent
      manner. Collectively, these results indicate that DC-B01 is a promising BCL-2 BH4
      domain inhibitor with the potential for further development.

TI  - Targeted inhibition of ubiquitin signaling reverses metabolic reprogramming and
      suppresses glioblastoma growth.
PG  - 780
LID - 10.1038/s42003-022-03639-8 [doi]
AB  - Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most frequent and aggressive form of primary
      brain tumor in the adult population; its high recurrence rate and resistance to
      current therapeutics urgently demand a better therapy. Regulation of protein
      stability by the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) represents an important
      control mechanism of cell growth. UPS deregulation is mechanistically linked to
      the development and progression of a variety of human cancers, including GBM.
      Thus, the UPS represents a potentially valuable target for GBM treatment. Using
      an integrated approach that includes proteomics, transcriptomics and metabolic
      profiling, we identify praja2, a RING E3 ubiquitin ligase, as the key component
      of a signaling network that regulates GBM cell growth and metabolism. Praja2 is
      preferentially expressed in primary GBM lesions expressing the wild-type
      isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 gene (IDH1). Mechanistically, we found that praja2
      ubiquitylates and degrades the kinase suppressor of Ras 2 (KSR2). As a
      consequence, praja2 restrains the activity of downstream AMP-dependent protein
      kinase in GBM cells and attenuates the oxidative metabolism. Delivery in the
      brain of siRNA targeting praja2 by transferrin-targeted self-assembling
      nanoparticles (SANPs) prevented KSR2 degradation and inhibited GBM growth,
      reducing the size of the tumor and prolonging the survival rate of treated mice. 
      These data identify praja2 as an essential regulator of cancer cell metabolism,
      and as a potential therapeutic target to suppress GBM growth.

      family 8 in colorectal cancer.

LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-15629-1 [doi]
AB  - The TBC (Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16, TBC) structural domain is now considered as one of the
      factors potentially regulating tumor progression. However, to date, studies on
      the relationship between TBC structural domains and tumors are limited. In this
      study, we identified the role of TBC1 domain family member 8 (TBC1D8) as an
      oncogene in colorectal cancer (CRC) by least absolute shrinkage and selection
      operator (LASSO) and Cox regression analysis, showing that TBC1D8 may
      independently predict CRC outcome. Functional enrichment and single-cell analysis
      showed that TBC1D8 levels were associated with hypoxia. TBC1D8 levels were also
      positively correlated with M2 macrophage infiltration, which may have a complex
      association with hypoxia. Taken together, these results show that the TBC1D8 gene
      is involved in colorectal carcinogenesis, and the underlying molecular mechanisms
      may include hypoxia and immune cell infiltration.

TI  - Formulation, characterization and cellular toxicity assessment of a novel
      bee-venom microsphere in prostate cancer treatment.
PG  - 13213
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-17391-w [doi]
AB  - Bee venom (B.V.) is a toxin produced naturally by honey bees with several toxic
      and therapeutic efficacies. It is used in the treatment of different cancer kinds
      like renal, hepatic, and prostate cancer. Due to its protein nature, it is
      degraded in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Colon-targeted drug delivery
      systems represent a useful tool to protect B.V. from degradation and can be
      administered orally instead of I.V. infusion and traditional bee stinging. In the
      present study, B.V. loaded enteric-coated cross-linked microspheres were prepared
      by emulsion cross-linking method. Percentage yield, entrapment efficiency %,
      swelling degree, and in-vitro release are evaluated for prepared microspheres.
      Free B.V., optimized microspheres formula (F3), and doxorubicin cytotoxic effects
      were tested by MTT assay. Results concluded that free B.V. was more effective
      against the growth of human prostate adenocarcinoma (PC3) cells followed by
      optimized microspheres than doxorubicin. But both free B.V. and doxorubicin have 
      a cytotoxic effect on normal oral epithelial cells (OEC). According to flow
      cytometric analysis, the optimized microsphere formula induced apoptosis and
      reduced necrosis percent at IC50 concentration. Furthermore, microspheres did not
      affect the viability of OEC. These results revealed that microspheres have a
      degree of specificity for malignant cells. Therefore, it seems that this targeted
      formulation could be a good candidate for future clinical trials for cancer
      therapy.

TI  - Construction of a novel signature and prediction of the immune landscape in
      gastric cancer based on necroptosis-related genes.
PG  - 13290
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-15854-8 [doi]
AB  - Necroptosis, a type of programmed cell death, has become a potential therapeutic 
      target for solid tumors. Nevertheless, the potential roles of necroptosis-related
      genes (NRGs) in gastric cancer (GC) remain unknown. The objective of the present 
      study was to create a necroptosis-related prognostic signature that can provide
      more accurate assessment of prognosis in GC. Using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
      and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data, we identified differentially expressed
      NRGs. Univariate analysis and Lasso regression were performed to determine the
      prognostic signature. Risk scores were calculated and all GC patients were
      divided into high- and low-risk score group according to the median risk score
      value. The robustness of this signature was externally validated with data from
      GSE84437 cohort (n = 431). Survival analysis revealed high-risk score patients
      had a worse prognosis. Results evidenced that the signature was an independent
      prognosis factor for survival. Single-sample sequence set enrichment analysis
      (ssGSEA) exhibited different enrichment of immune cells and immune-related
      pathways in the two risk groups. Furthermore, a predictive nomogram was generated
      and showed excellent predictive performance based on discrimination and
      calibration. In addition, the risk score positively correlated with tumor
      mutational burden and was associated with sensitivity to multiple anti-cancer
      drugs. Overall, our work demonstrates a close relationship between necroptosis
      and the prognosis of GC. The signature we constructed with potential clinical
      application value, can be used for prognosis prediction and being a potential
      therapeutic responses indicator in GC patients.

PG  - 13222
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-16657-7 [doi]
AB  - The emerging targeted therapies have revolutionized the treatment of advanced
      clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) over the past 15 years. Nevertheless,
      lack of personalized treatment limits the development of effective clinical
      guidelines and improvement of patient prognosis. In this study, large-scale
      genomic profiles from ccRCC cohorts were explored for integrative analysis. A
      credible method was developed to identify synthetic lethality (SL) pairs and a
      list of 72 candidate pairs was determined, which might be utilized to selectively
      eliminate tumors with genetic aberrations using SL partners of specific
      mutations. Further analysis identified BRD4 and PRKDC as novel medical targets
      for patients with BAP1 mutations. After mapping these target genes to the
      comprehensive drug datasets, two agents (BI-2536 and PI-103) were found to have
      considerable therapeutic potentials in the BAP1 mutant tumors. Overall, our
      findings provided insight into the overview of ccRCC mutation patterns and
      offered novel opportunities for improving individualized cancer treatment.

TI  - Ribosome impairment regulates intestinal stem cell identity via ZAKa activation.
PG  - 4492
LID - 10.1038/s41467-022-32220-4 [doi]
AB  - The small intestine is a rapidly proliferating organ that is maintained by a
      small population of Lgr5-expressing intestinal stem cells (ISCs). However,
      several Lgr5-negative ISC populations have been identified, and this remarkable
      plasticity allows the intestine to rapidly respond to both the local environment 
      and to damage. However, the mediators of such plasticity are still largely
      unknown. Using intestinal organoids and mouse models, we show that upon ribosome 
      impairment (driven by Rptor deletion, amino acid starvation, or low dose
      cyclohexamide treatment) ISCs gain an Lgr5-negative, fetal-like identity. This is
      accompanied by a rewiring of metabolism. Our findings suggest that the ribosome
      can act as a sensor of nutrient availability, allowing ISCs to respond to the
      local nutrient environment. Mechanistically, we show that this phenotype requires
      the activation of ZAKa, which in turn activates YAP, via SRC. Together, our data 
      reveals a central role for ribosome dynamics in intestinal stem cells, and
      identify the activation of ZAKa as a critical mediator of stem cell identity.

      microenvironments.

AB  - While hypoxia promotes carcinogenesis, tumour aggressiveness, metastasis, and
      resistance to oncological treatments, the impacts of hyperoxia on tumours are
      rarely explored because providing a long-lasting oxygen supply in vivo is a major
      challenge. Herein, we construct micro oxygen factories, namely, photosynthesis
      microcapsules (PMCs), by encapsulation of acquired cyanobacteria and upconversion
      nanoparticles in alginate microcapsules. This system enables a long-lasting
      oxygen supply through the conversion of external radiation into red-wavelength
      emissions for photosynthesis in cyanobacteria. PMC treatment suppresses the NF-kB
      pathway, HIF-1alpha production and cancer cell proliferation. Hyperoxic
      microenvironment created by an in vivo PMC implant inhibits hepatocarcinoma
      growth and metastasis and has synergistic effects together with anti-PD-1 in
      breast cancer. The engineering oxygen factories offer potential for tumour
      biology studies in hyperoxic microenvironments and inspire the exploration of
      oncological treatments.

AB  - The accurate determination of sarcopenia is critical for disease management in
      patients with head and neck cancer (HNC). Quantitative determination of
      sarcopenia is currently dependent on manually-generated segmentations of skeletal
      muscle derived from computed tomography (CT) cross-sectional imaging. This has
      prompted the increasing utilization of machine learning models for automated
      sarcopenia determination. However, extant datasets currently do not provide the
      necessary manually-generated skeletal muscle segmentations at the C3 vertebral
      level needed for building these models. In this data descriptor, a set of 394 HNC
      patients were selected from The Cancer Imaging Archive, and their skeletal muscle
      and adipose tissue was manually segmented at the C3 vertebral level using
      sliceOmatic. Subsequently, using publicly disseminated Python scripts, we
      generated corresponding segmentations files in Neuroimaging Informatics
      Technology Initiative format. In addition to segmentation data, additional
      clinical demographic data germane to body composition analysis have been
      retrospectively collected for these patients. These data are a valuable resource 
      for studying sarcopenia and body composition analysis in patients with HNC.

TI  - Regulation of cholesterol homeostasis in health and diseases: from mechanisms to 
      targeted therapeutics.
PG  - 265
LID - 10.1038/s41392-022-01125-5 [doi]
AB  - Disturbed cholesterol homeostasis plays critical roles in the development of
      multiple diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases (CVD), neurodegenerative
      diseases and cancers, particularly the CVD in which the accumulation of lipids
      (mainly the cholesteryl esters) within macrophage/foam cells underneath the
      endothelial layer drives the formation of atherosclerotic lesions eventually.
      More and more studies have shown that lowering cholesterol level, especially
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, protects cardiovascular system and
      prevents cardiovascular events effectively. Maintaining cholesterol homeostasis
      is determined by cholesterol biosynthesis, uptake, efflux, transport, storage,
      utilization, and/or excretion. All the processes should be precisely controlled
      by the multiple regulatory pathways. Based on the regulation of cholesterol
      homeostasis, many interventions have been developed to lower cholesterol by
      inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis and uptake or enhancing cholesterol
      utilization and excretion. Herein, we summarize the historical review and
      research events, the current understandings of the molecular pathways playing key
      roles in regulating cholesterol homeostasis, and the cholesterol-lowering
      interventions in clinics or in preclinical studies as well as new
      cholesterol-lowering targets and their clinical advances. More importantly, we
      review and discuss the benefits of those interventions for the treatment of
      multiple diseases including atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, obesity,
      diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases,
      osteoporosis and virus infection.

TI  - BET bromodomain inhibition rescues PD-1-mediated T-cell exhaustion in acute
      myeloid leukemia.
PG  - 671
LID - 10.1038/s41419-022-05123-x [doi]
AB  - Sustained expression of programmed cell death receptor-1 (PD-1) is correlated
      with the exhaustion of T cells, and blockade of the PD-1 pathway is an effective 
      immunotherapeutic strategy for treating various cancers. However, response rates 
      are limited, and many patients do not achieve durable responses. Thus, it is
      important to seek additional strategies that can improve anticancer immunity.
      Here, we report that the bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) inhibitor JQ1
      inhibits PD-1 expression in Jurkat T cells, primary T cells, and T-cell
      exhaustion models. Furthermore, JQ1 dramatically impaired the expression of PD-1 
      and T-cell immunoglobulin mucin-domain-containing-3 (Tim-3) and promoted the
      secretion of cytokines in T cells from patients with acute myeloid leukemia
      (AML). In line with that, BET inhibitor-treated CD19-CAR T and CD123-CAR T cells 
      have enhanced anti-leukemia potency and resistant to exhaustion. Mechanistically,
      BRD4 binds to the NFAT2 and PDCD1 (encoding PD-1) promoters, and NFAT2 binds to
      the PDCD1 and HAVCR2 (encoding Tim-3) promoters. JQ1-treated T cells showed
      downregulated NFAT2, PD-1, and Tim-3 expression. In addition, BET inhibitor
      suppressed programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and cell growth in AML
      cell lines and in primary AML cells. We also demonstrated that JQ1 treatment led 
      to inhibition of leukemia progression, reduced T-cell PD-1/Tim-3 expression, and 
      prolonged survival in MLL-AF9 AML mouse model and Nalm6 (B-cell acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia cell)-bearing mouse leukemia model. Taken together, BET
      inhibition improved anti-leukemia immunity by regulating PD-1/PD-L1 expression,
      and also directly suppressed AML cells, which provides novel insights on the
      multiple effects of BET inhibition for cancer therapy.

AB  - The benefit of molecularly-informed therapies in cancer of unknown primary (CUP) 
      is unclear. Here, we use comprehensive molecular characterization by whole
      genome/exome, transcriptome and methylome analysis in 70 CUP patients to reveal
      substantial mutational heterogeneity with TP53, MUC16, KRAS, LRP1B and CSMD3
      being the most frequently mutated known cancer-related genes. The most common
      fusion partner is FGFR2, the most common focal homozygous deletion affects
      CDKN2A. 56/70 (80%) patients receive genomics-based treatment recommendations
      which are applied in 20/56 (36%) cases. Transcriptome and methylome data provide 
      evidence for the underlying entity in 62/70 (89%) cases. Germline analysis
      reveals five (likely) pathogenic mutations in five patients. Recommended
      off-label therapies translate into a mean PFS ratio of 3.6 with a median PFS1 of 
      2.9 months (17 patients) and a median PFS2 of 7.8 months (20 patients). Our data 
      emphasize the clinical value of molecular analysis and underline the need for
      innovative, mechanism-based clinical trials.

PG  - 4493
LID - 10.1038/s41467-022-32022-8 [doi]
AB  - Antibiotic resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is exclusively a consequence 
      of chromosomal mutations. Translesion synthesis (TLS) is a widely conserved
      mechanism of DNA damage tolerance and mutagenesis, executed by translesion
      polymerases such as DinBs. In mycobacteria, DnaE2 is the only known agent of TLS 
      and the role of DinB polymerases is unknown. Here we demonstrate that, when
      overexpressed, DinB1 promotes missense mutations conferring resistance to
      rifampicin, with a mutational signature distinct from that of DnaE2, and abets
      insertion and deletion frameshift mutagenesis in homo-oligonucleotide runs. DinB1
      is the primary mediator of spontaneous -1 frameshift mutations in
      homo-oligonucleotide runs whereas DnaE2 and DinBs are redundant in DNA
      damage-induced -1 frameshift mutagenesis. These results highlight DinB1 and DnaE2
      as drivers of mycobacterial genome diversification with relevance to
      antimicrobial resistance and host adaptation.

TI  - Targeting HECTD3-IKKalpha axis inhibits inflammation-related metastasis.
PG  - 264
LID - 10.1038/s41392-022-01057-0 [doi]
AB  - Metastasis is the leading cause of cancer-related death. The interactions between
      circulating tumor cells and endothelial adhesion molecules in distant organs is a
      key step during extravasation in hematogenous metastasis. Surgery is a common
      intervention for most primary solid tumors. However, surgical trauma-related
      systemic inflammation facilitates distant tumor metastasis by increasing the
      spread and adhesion of tumor cells to vascular endothelial cells (ECs).
      Currently, there are no effective interventions to prevent distant metastasis.
      Here, we show that HECTD3 deficiency in ECs significantly reduces tumor
      metastasis in multiple mouse models. HECTD3 depletion downregulates expression of
      adhesion molecules, such as VCAM-1, ICAM-1 and E-selectin, in mouse primary ECs
      and HUVECs stimulated by inflammatory factors and inhibits adhesion of tumor
      cells to ECs both in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate that HECTD3 promotes
      stabilization, nuclear localization and kinase activity of IKKalpha by
      ubiquitinating IKKalpha with K27- and K63-linked polyubiquitin chains at K296,
      increasing phosphorylation of histone H3 to promote NF-kappaB target gene
      transcription. Knockout of HECTD3 in endothelium significantly inhibits tumor
      cells lung colonization, while conditional knockin promotes that. IKKalpha kinase
      inhibitors prevented LPS-induced pulmonary metastasis. These findings reveal the 
      promotional role of the HECTD3-IKKalpha axis in tumor hematogenous metastasis and
      provide a potential strategy for tumor metastasis prevention.

TI  - Human-specific gene CT47 blocks PRMT5 degradation to lead to meiosis arrest.
PG  - 345
LID - 10.1038/s41420-022-01139-6 [doi]
AB  - Exploring the functions of human-specific genes (HSGs) is challenging due to the 
      lack of a tractable genetic model system. Testosterone is essential for
      maintaining human spermatogenesis and fertility, but the underlying mechanism is 
      unclear. Here, we identified Cancer/Testis Antigen gene family 47 (CT47) as an
      essential regulator of human-specific spermatogenesis by stabilizing arginine
      methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5). A humanized mouse model revealed that CT47 functions
      to arrest spermatogenesis by interacting with and regulating CT47/PRMT5
      accumulation in the nucleus during the leptotene/zygotene-to-pachytene transition
      of meiosis. We demonstrate that testosterone induces nuclear depletion of
      CT47/PRMT5 and rescues leptotene-arrested spermatocyte progression in humanized
      testes. Loss of CT47 in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) by CRISPR/Cas9 led to 
      an increase in haploid cells but blocked the testosterone-induced increase in
      haploid cells when hESCs were differentiated into haploid spermatogenic cells.
      Moreover, CT47 levels were decreased in nonobstructive azoospermia. Together,
      these results established CT47 as a crucial regulator of human spermatogenesis by
      preventing meiosis initiation before the testosterone surge.

TI  - Transcriptomic diversity in human medullary thymic epithelial cells.
PG  - 4296
LID - 10.1038/s41467-022-31750-1 [doi]
AB  - The induction of central T cell tolerance in the thymus depends on the
      presentation of peripheral self-epitopes by medullary thymic epithelial cells
      (mTECs). This promiscuous gene expression (pGE) drives mTEC transcriptomic
      diversity, with non-canonical transcript initiation, alternative splicing, and
      expression of endogenous retroelements (EREs) representing important but
      incompletely understood contributors. Here we map the expression of genome-wide
      transcripts in immature and mature human mTECs using high-throughput 5' cap and
      RNA sequencing. Both mTEC populations show high splicing entropy, potentially
      driven by the expression of peripheral splicing factors. During mTEC maturation, 
      rates of global transcript mis-initiation increase and EREs enriched in long
      terminal repeat retrotransposons are up-regulated, the latter often found in
      proximity to differentially expressed genes. As a resource, we provide an
      interactive public interface for exploring mTEC transcriptomic diversity. Our
      findings therefore help construct a map of transcriptomic diversity in the
      healthy human thymus and may ultimately facilitate the identification of those
      epitopes which contribute to autoimmunity and immune recognition of tumor
      antigens.

TI  - A common deletion at BAK1 reduces enhancer activity and confers risk of
      intracranial germ cell tumors.
PG  - 4478
LID - 10.1038/s41467-022-32005-9 [doi]
AB  - Intracranial germ cell tumors (IGCTs) are rare brain neoplasms that mainly occur 
      in children and adolescents with a particularly high incidence in East Asian
      populations. Here, we conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 133
      patients with IGCTs and 762 controls of Japanese ancestry. A common 4-bp deletion
      polymorphism in an enhancer adjacent to BAK1 is significantly associated with the
      disease risk (rs3831846; P = 2.4 x 10(-9), odds ratio = 2.46 [95% CI: 1.83-3.31],
      minor allele frequency = 0.43). Rs3831846 is in strong linkage disequilibrium
      with a testicular GCTs susceptibility variant rs210138. In-vitro reporter assays 
      reveal rs3831846 to be a functional variant attenuating the enhancer activity,
      suggesting its contribution to IGCTs predisposition through altering BAK1
      expression. Risk alleles of testicular GCTs derived from the European GWAS show
      significant positive correlations in the effect sizes with the Japanese IGCTs
      GWAS (P = 1.3 x 10(-4), Spearman's rho = 0.48). These results suggest the shared 
      genetic susceptibility of GCTs beyond ethnicity and primary sites.

TI  - A rapid and sensitive UPLC-MS/MS method for determination of anlotinib in plasma 
      and dried blood spots: Method development, validation and clinical application.
PG  - e9372
LID - 10.1002/rcm.9372 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Anlotinib is a multi-targets tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which was
      approved in China for treating several cancer types. Dose individualization based
      on therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is a useful tool to reduce toxicity.
      However, it's not convenient for patients to go to hospital for routine TDM via
      venous blood sampling at a certain time. METHODS: An ultra-performance liquid
      chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method was developed and
      validated for determination of anlotinib in human plasma and dried blood spot
      (DBS), characterized by simple sample preparation, high sensitivity and short
      analysis time. The assay was validated in the concentration range of 0.2-200
      ng/mL in plasma and 5-1000 ng/mL in DBS. This method was applied to monitor
      anlotinib exposure levels in patients with advanced biliary tract cancer (BTC)
      and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). RESULTS: The trough plasma concentration 
      (Ctrough ) of anlotinib was highly variable among BTC patients with coefficients 
      of variation (CV) of 47.5%. DBS and venous blood samples were also collected from
      NSCLC patients to determine whether DBS sampling is a viable alternative sampling
      approach. Pearson correlation coefficient (R) between DBS and plasma
      concentration was 0.985. Bland-Altman plot demonstrated that the difference
      between estimated and measured plasma concentration was -2.9%. And 87% of sample 
      pairs had a maximal deviation of +/-20%. CONCLUSIONS: Anlotinib exhibites a high 
      inter-individual variability in plasma exposure, and DBS sampling could be a
      promising tool for TDM of anlotinib.

AB  - The brisk remodeling in healthcare delivery observed after the COVID-19 outbreak 
      led us to evaluate how the pandemic affected non-melanoma skin cancer's (NMSC)
      care and tumor burden. To address this topic, we set up a retrospective real-life
      multi-center study based on the cities of Bergamo and Varese, whose provinces
      were the worst hit in Italy by the pandemic. We analyzed medical and pathological
      data from patients that underwent surgery in the two months preceding the
      outbreak in Italy and compared them to those who did in the corresponding
      bimester of the following year, reaching 214 patients and 274 lesions. We
      observed a considerable and significant increase in NMSC's diameter, as well as
      in the proportion of squamous cell carcinomas. Both the average waiting time to
      obtain an evaluation visit and the average time in the surgical waiting list was 
      shorter after the COVID-19 outbreak: the reason is that we evaluated and operated
      near-exclusive patients affected by high-priority lesions, who benefited from
      "fast-track" referrals. Conversely, less-concerning lesions were, and still are, 
      left on hold, until they will become advanced enough to be labeled as "urgent".
      Plastic surgery departments should evade as soon as possible from this downward
      spiral, in order to provide our patients with timely cancer care and to be able
      to treat all plastic surgery-requiring pathologies.

TI  - Bayesian adaptive clinical trial designs for respiratory medicine.
LID - 10.1111/resp.14337 [doi]
AB  - The use of Bayesian adaptive designs for clinical trials has increased in recent 
      years, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Bayesian adaptive designs offer
      a flexible and efficient framework for conducting clinical trials and may provide
      results that are more useful and natural to interpret for clinicians, compared to
      traditional approaches. In this review, we provide an introduction to Bayesian
      adaptive designs and discuss its use in recent clinical trials conducted in
      respiratory medicine. We illustrate this approach by constructing a Bayesian
      adaptive design for a multi-arm trial that compares two non-invasive ventilation 
      treatments to standard oxygen therapy for patients with acute cardiogenic
      pulmonary oedema. We highlight the benefits and some of the challenges involved
      in designing and implementing Bayesian adaptive trials.

AB  - An 80 year-old woman was referred for a one-eyed palpebral edema. She had ptosis 
      and oblique diplopia resistant to corticotherapy. An orbit magnetic resonance
      imaging showed a mass infiltrating the optic nerve, with an enhancement of the
      whole orbital musculature. Biopsies of the lacrimal gland were positive for
      immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis. Debulking surgery is the main treatment
      modality for symptomatic patients with localized orbital amyloidosis. Diffuse
      orbital involvement may make excision difficult. We managed to treat her through 
      radiation therapy to allow a surgical procedure, delivering 20Gy in 10 fractions.
      The main aim of radiation therapy was to eradicate the B cells that produced the 
      amyloid light chain deposition. After radiation therapy, the orbital inflammatory
      caused by the lymphoid infiltration diminished and corticotherapy could be
      stopped. The surgery could be performed with excellent clinical results. At
      2-year follow-up, neither tumor regrowth nor late complications were detected.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is difficult to diagnose early since tumor markers 
      have low sensitivity and specificity. We simultaneously measured serum
      carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9, pancreatic elastase-1, lipase, and amylase, and
      evaluated the accuracy of a single marker or a combination of two, three, or four
      markers in the diagnosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). METHODS:
      Seventy-six patients with PDAC were included, and 75 patients with non-PDAC
      diseases were enrolled as the control group. Blood specimens were collected and
      analyzed for pancreatic elatase-1, CA19-9, amylase and lipase. Sensitivity,
      specificity, and accuracy for each individual marker and in combination were
      determined. RESULTS: In PDAC subjects, abnormal CA19-9 was seen most frequently
      at 80.3%, followed by pancreatic elastase-1 at 57.9%, lipase at 53.9%, and
      amylase at 51.3%. In non-PDAC subjects, the percentage of abnormal serum
      pancreatic elastase-1, CA19-9, lipase, and amylase were 50.7%, 41.3%, 40.0%, and 
      28.0%, respectively. The accuracy rate of amylase and CA19-9 results combined was
      64.9% and was higher than the combination of other markers in the intersection
      set. In the union set, the group of amylase and CA19-9 combined and the group of 
      lipase and CA19-9 combined had the highest accuracy at 66.2%. In the intersection
      and union set, the area under the curve of CA19-9 was the highest at 0.695.
      CONCLUSION: CA19-9 as a single marker is the most accurate in the clinical
      diagnosis of PDAC. Combination of lipase, amylase, or pancreatic elastase-1
      results does not significantly increase the accuracy of PDAC diagnosis.

TI  - Cancer-specific Mortality in T1a Renal Cell Carcinoma Treated with Local Tumor
      Destruction Versus Partial Nephrectomy.
LID - S2405-4569(22)00167-5 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.euf.2022.07.005 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Large-scale analyses addressing cancer-specific mortality (CSM) in
      T1a renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients treated with local tumor destruction
      (LTD), relative to partial nephrectomy (PN), are scarce. OBJECTIVE: To compare
      CSM after LTD versus PN. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Within the
      Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database (2004-2018), we
      identified patients with clinical T1a stage RCC treated with LTD or PN. OUTCOME
      MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSES: After 1:1 ratio propensity score matching 
      (PSM) between patients treated with LTD versus PN, competing risks regression
      (CRR) models addressed CSM, after adjustment for other-cause mortality (OCM) and 
      other covariates (age, tumor size, tumor grade, and histological subtype).
      RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Relative to the 35 984 PN patients, 5936 LTD patients
      were older and more frequently harbored unknown RCC histological subtype or
      unknown grade. After 1:1 PSM that resulted in 5352 LTD versus 5352 PN patients,
      the 10-yr CSM rate was 8.7% versus 5.5%. In multivariable CRR models, LTD was
      associated with higher CSM, relative to PN (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.58, p < 0.001). 
      Subgroup analyses revealed invariably higher CSM after LTD versus PN in patients 
      with tumor size </=3 cm (10-yr CSM 7.2% vs 5.3%, multivariable HR: 1.47, p <
      0.001) and in patients with tumor size 3.1-4 cm (10-yr CSM 11.4% vs 6.1%,
      multivariable HR: 1.72, p < 0.001). Lack of information regarding earlier cancer 
      controls, retreatment, tumor location within the kidney, and type of surgery
      represented limitations. CONCLUSIONS: In T1a RCC patients, LTD is invariably
      associated with higher CSM relative to PN, even after adjustment for OCM and all 
      available patient and tumor characteristics, and regardless of tumor size
      considerations. However, the magnitude of CSM disadvantage was more pronounced in
      LTD patients with tumor size 3.1-4 cm than in those with tumor size </=3 cm.
      PATIENT SUMMARY: In patients with small renal masses, we observed higher
      cancer-specific death rates for local tumor destruction (LTD) than for partial
      nephrectomy. The LTD disadvantage was more pronounced for patients with tumor
      size 3.1-4 cm, but was also present in those with tumor size </=3 cm.

      Treatment with a Focus on Urothelial and Renal Cell Carcinoma.
LID - S2405-4569(22)00163-8 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.euf.2022.07.002 [doi]
AB  - Despite the recent approval of numerous immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) for
      the treatment of genitourinary tumors, predictive biomarkers are still lacking.
      Different approaches are necessary, as the only approved biomarker for urothelial
      carcinoma (UC), namely PD-L1 immunostaining, has questionable predictive value.
      By contrast, tumor-infiltrating cells have been associated with therapy response 
      in both UC and renal cell carcinoma. Tumor-derived gene signatures can further
      identify patients with pre-existing adaptive immunity. Whereas tumor mutation
      burden, DNA repair defects, and microsatellite instability are of some predictive
      value, the utility of single gene mutations has not yet been proved. As ICIs
      mainly target tumor metastases, analysis of primary tumors appears to be
      suboptimal. Circulating biomarkers reflecting tumor and systemic alterations in a
      more complex and dynamic manner are of great potential. The most promising
      approach is an analysis of complex tumor composition with concomitant
      consideration of the host immune status, which is also influenced by the gut
      microbiome. PATIENT SUMMARY: Immunotherapy is one of the treatment options for
      cancers of the urinary tract and kidney. We review the methods for measuring
      biomarkers that may predict which patients are most likely to respond to this
      treatment.

LID - 10.1016/j.clgc.2022.06.009 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND: Only 1 randomized controlled trial has compared focal
      therapy and active surveillance (AS) for the low-risk prostate cancer (PCa). We
      investigated whether focal HIFU (fHIFU) yields oncologic advantages over AS for
      low-risk PCa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included 2 non-randomized prospective
      series of 132 (fHIFU) and 421 (AS) consecutive patients diagnosed with ISUP 1 PCa
      between 2008 and 2018. A matched pair analysis was performed to decrease
      potential bias. Study main outcomes were freedom from radical treatment (RT) or
      androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), treatment-free survival (TFS), time to
      metastasis, and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Median fHIFU follow-up was 50
      months (interquartile range, 29-84 months). Among matched variables, no major
      differences were recorded except for AS having more suspicious digital rectal
      examination findings (P = .0074) and recent enrollment year (P = .0005).
      Five-year intervention-free survival from RT or ADT was higher for the fHIFU
      cohort (67.4% vs. 53.8%; P = .0158). Time to treatment was approximately 10
      months shorter for AS than for fHIFU (time to RT, P = .0363; time to RT or ADT, P
      = .0156; time to any treatment, P = .0319). No differences were found in any-TFS 
      (fHIFU, 61.4% vs. AS, 53.8%; P = .2635), OS (fHIFU, 97% vs. AS, 97%; P = .9237), 
      or metastasis (n = 0 in fHIFU and n = 2 in AS; P = .4981). Major complications
      (>/= Clavien 3) were rare (n = 4), although 36.4% of men experienced
      complications. No relevant changes were noted in continence (P = .3949).
      CONCLUSION: At a 4-year median follow-up, fHIFU for mainly low-risk PCa (ISUP
      grade 1) is safe, may decrease the need for radical treatment or ADT and may
      allow longer time to treatment compared to AS. Nonetheless, no advantages are
      seen in PCa progression and/or death (OS).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Histologic tumor necrosis (TN) is a well-established independent
      prognostic indicator in patients treated surgically for clear cell renal cell
      carcinoma (ccRCC). However, the precise mechanisms by which TN alters disease
      progression remain unknown. The DEAD-box protein DDX41, a member of a large
      family of helicases, has been characterized as a pattern recognition receptor
      against an array of double-stranded (ds)DNA produced from bacteria, dsDNA
      viruses, and nearby cells that have released dsDNA fragments through necrosis. We
      hypothesized that DDX41 expression may be upregulated in ccRCC with TN, leading
      to worse prognosis. METHODS: Relationship between the presence of TN and DDX41
      expression were examined using The Cancer Genome Atlas data sets or using ccRCC
      samples in our institution. Further, the molecular functions of DDX41 were
      investigated with human ccRCC cells. RESULTS: The presence of TN was
      significantly associated with the upregulation of mRNA and protein expression of 
      DDX41 in the 2different patient cohorts with ccRCC. In addition, the mRNA and
      protein expression levels of DDX41 revealed a worse prognosis. In vitro analyses 
      with ccRCC cells revealed that DDX41 expression promotes tumor-promoting
      activity. Furthermore, VHL loss, 1of the most common features in ccRCC, was shown
      to play an extremely important role in increasing the expression of the CXCL
      family in DDX41-expressing ccRCC, leading to the acquisition of a worse malignant
      phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: DDX41 expression is associated with TN in ccRCC and leads
      to a worse prognosis in cooperation with VHL loss.

TI  - Genomic landscape of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma with
      squamous differentiation compared to pure urothelial carcinoma.
LID - S1078-1439(22)00257-5 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.urolonc.2022.07.002 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Urothelial carcinoma with squamous differentiation (UCS) is the most 
      common variant differentiation of urothelial carcinoma (UC). Although treatment
      is usually similar to pure UC, there is paucity of data regarding its genomic
      landscape and putative molecular drivers. In this study, we compared the
      mutational profile of tumors with UCS and UC histology. METHODS: In this
      IRB-approved retrospective study, patients with advanced UCS and UC undergoing
      tumor based comprehensive genomic profiling from a CLIA-certified laboratory were
      included. An independent genitourinary pathologist reviewed all cases. Patients
      were determined to have UCS based on presence of any component of squamous
      differentiation. Patients with UC having any other secondary histology variant
      were excluded. Genes with alterations (GA) in less than 5% of patients and
      variants of unknown significance were excluded from the analysis. Chi-square test
      was used to compare gene aberration frequency and the p-values were adjusted for 
      false using Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) correction. RESULTS: Among the 87 eligible
      patients with UCS (n=31) and UC (n=56), patients with UCS were more likely to be 
      female (32.3% vs. 14.3%, p=0.047) with no significant differences in other
      clinicopathological features. Most common genomic alterations seen in UCS were
      TP53 (67.7%), KMT2D (48.4%) and ARID1A (32.3%). KMT2D mutations were
      significantly enriched in UCS (48.4% vs. 0%, FDR adj.p >0.001, p = >0.001)
      compared to UC. Prevalence of CUL4A mutations was numerically higher in UCS vs.
      UC (12.9% vs. 1.8%, FDR adj.p= 0.43, p = 0.03). Tumor mutation burden and the
      number of genomic aberrations per patient were not significantly different
      between the two groups. CONCLUSION: These findings highlight significant
      enrichment of KMT2D mutations in UCS and potential role of chromatin remodeling
      genes as drivers and potential therapeutic targets.

TI  - Association Between Adherence to the EAT-Lancet Diet and Risk of Cancer and
      Cardiovascular Outcomes in the Prospective NutriNet-Sante Cohort.
LID - nqac208 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/ajcn/nqac208 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The EAT-Lancet commission proposed, in 2019, a planetary, healthy and
      universal dietary. However, this diet has been rarely studied in relation to
      various health outcomes. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to prospectively estimate the
      association between the EAT-Lancet diet and cancer and cardiovascular risk.
      DESIGN: The study was conducted among participants of the NutriNet-Sante cohort
      (2009-2021). The endpoints were the incident outcomes (cancer and cardiovascular 
      diseases (CVD) and mortality from these diseases), combined and separately.
      Adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet was estimated using the EAT-Lancet Diet Index
      (ELD-I) modelled as quintiles (Q). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models 
      were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs),
      adjusted for potential confounders and moderators. RESULTS: A total of 62,382
      subjects were included, 2,475 cases of cancer and 786 cases of cardiovascular
      occurred during a median follow-up of 8.1 years. The sample was 76% female, the
      mean age at inclusion was 51 years (Standard Deviation (SD) = 10.2 years). The
      ELD-I ranged from -162 to 332 points with a mean score of 45.4 points (SD = 25.6 
      points). In multivariable models, no significant association between the
      EAT-Lancet diet and the risk of cancer and CVD combined, and separately, was
      observed. Alcohol consumption was an effect modifier of the association. A
      significant association was observed among low drinkers (HR Q5 vs Q1 = 0.86, (95%
      CI 0.73, 1.02), p-trend = 0.02). A higher ELD-I was significantly associated with
      a lower risk of overall cancer only among females, (HR Q5 vs Q1 = 0.89, (95% CI
      0.75, 1.05), p-trend = 0.03). Both associations were largely attenuated by body
      mass index. CONCLUSION: Contrary to our hypothesis, our results documented
      significant associations between adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet and incidence
      of cancer only in some subgroups, and no association with CVD.

AB  - RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the endometrial thickness of endometrium exposed to
      testosterone in transmasculine people compared with unexposed endometrium in
      cisgender women as determined by transvaginal ultrasound (TVU)? DESIGN: Single
      centre, cross-sectional cohort study conducted the Centre of Expertise on Gender 
      Dysphoria in Amsterdam. Between 2013 and 2015, transmasculine people scheduled
      for gender affirming surgery (GAS) were included in this study after they
      provided informed consent. They were undergoing gender affirming hormone therapy 
      (testosterone) for at least 1 year. Endometrial thickness (mm) was measured by
      TVU in transmasculine people, immediately before their GAS while under general
      anaesthesia. Cisgender control women from the general population underwent the
      exact same TVU measurements in an outpatient clinical setting on cycle days 2-5. 
      RESULT: Fifty-one transmasculine people and 77 controls were included. The mean
      duration of testosterone use was 30.2 months (SD 8.8). Endometrial thickness was 
      significantly lower in transmasculine people compared with cisgender women:
      median 3.9 mm (interquartile range [IQR] 2.8-5.1) and 4.9 mm (IQR 4.0-6.3),
      respectively (P < 0.001), after correcting for confounding factor (current
      gonadotrophin releasing hormone agonist use). CONCLUSIONS: Endometrial thickness 
      in transmasculine people exposed to testosterone is significantly lower compared 
      with cisgender women without testosterone exposure. These results suggest an
      absence of endometrial proliferation by exogenous testosterone.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cancer ravages all aspects of a patient's life. In recent decades,
      there has been a substantial paradigm shift in the treatment of cancer with an
      emphasis on quality of life and patient comfort. Patients are treated
      holistically, a complex task given how multifaceted cancers are. Voice, a subtle 
      indicator of patients' well-being is affected commonly by malignancies. One of
      the various ways by which voice is disturbed by non-laryngeal cancers is through 
      metastasis to the larynx and adjacent areas. Metastasis to the larynx is rare but
      well-documented. If not diagnosed in a timely fashion, it can have devastating
      consequences on patients from life-threatening airway obstruction to progressive 
      dysphonia that erodes their quality of life. Metastatic lesions of the larynx
      usually appear submucosal with intact overlying mucosa and are located most
      commonly in the supraglottis. Deep biopsies usually are needed for diagnosis, and
      management may entail endoscopic resection or other treatments. OBJECTIVES: This 
      paper reviews the literature to identify typical features of laryngeal metastatic
      lesions of the ten cancers that are among the most common worldwide, ie, skin,
      renal, breast, colorectal, lung, prostate, thyroid and liver. By summarizing
      their most prevalent locations in the larynx, type and appearance, the authors
      hope to aid physicians in their diagnostic process, particularly in cases in
      which laryngeal involvement is the first presenting sign of a malignancy.

TI  - Family communication challenges of adolescents and young adults with Li-Fraumeni 
      syndrome: Implications for psychosocial care.

LID - 10.1016/j.pec.2022.07.012 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This qualitative-descriptive study explored adolescent and young
      adult (AYA) perspectives, experiences, and challenges with openness and
      closedness in family communication about Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). METHODS: We 
      conducted interviews with AYAs (aged 15-39 years) with LFS enrolled in the
      National Cancer Institute's LFS study (NCT01443468). An interprofessional
      clinician-researcher team analyzed transcribed data using the constant
      comparative method and interpretive description. RESULTS: AYAs (N = 38; 26
      females, 12 males, mean age=29 years) reported navigating openness and closedness
      about LFS in their families, which varied by LFS topic, relationship, disease
      trajectory, and developmental phase. AYAs described communication challenges,
      including broaching difficult topics (e.g., reproductive decision-making,
      end-of-life), balancing information-sharing with emotionally protecting family
      and self, and struggling with interactions that cause relational tensions.
      CONCLUSIONS: AYAs reported experiencing LFS family communication challenges that 
      disrupted their psychosocial well-being. LFS-related stressors and life
      transitions complicated and were complicated by these challenging family
      interactions. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Clinicians may support AYAs with LFS by
      inquiring about family communication, responding empathically to communication
      concerns, providing resources to support difficult conversations, and engaging
      mental health providers as needed. Researchers could partner with AYAs to develop
      tailored communication skills training and social support tools.

AB  - Lymph node dissection is a vital part of surgical treatment for early-stage
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Lobectomy with systematic lymph node
      dissection (SLND) still remains the gold standard surgical treatment for
      early-stage NSCLC patients. However, an increasing number of studies have
      demonstrated that lobe-specific lymph node dissection (L-SLND) can be used as an 
      alternative therapy for SLND in carefully selected patients with early-stage
      NSCLC. However, there are no currently available evidences of review summarizing 
      the role of L-SLDN in treating early-stage NSCLC. Therefore, we performed this
      literature review by summarizing the existing literatures on the lymph node
      drainage pattern, definition, scope and role of L-SLND in patients with
      early-stage NSCLC, aiming to provide evidence for the application of L-SLND in
      patients with early-stage NSCLC.

TI  - Genetic Variations in IFNGR1, BDNF and IL-10 May Predict the Susceptibility to
      Depression and Anxiety in Chinese Women With Breast Cancer.
LID - S1526-8209(22)00144-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.clbc.2022.07.002 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A large number of breast cancer survivors suffer from psychological
      distress. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between
      genetic variations in Chinese breast cancer patients and anxiety or depression,
      and to screen patients who are susceptible to psychological problems. METHODS: A 
      total of 300 early-stage breast cancer patients were recruited in this
      prospective observational single-center cohort study. With reference to the
      previous literature and the mechanism concerning anxiety and depression, 9
      candidate genes and 29 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) loci were selected.
      The association between SNP variations and anxiety/depression were analyzed.
      RESULTS: After we incorporated meaningful clinicopathological and demographic
      factors, multivariate analysis showed that the A/G and G/G genotypes of IFNGR1
      (rs2234711) and the T/C and T/T genotypes of BDNF (rs6265) were significantly
      associated with depression (HR 3.10, P = .008; HR 2.04, P = .03). The G/A and G/G
      genotypes of IL-10 (rs1554286) remained independent predictors of anxiety (HR
      1.85, P = .019). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggested that variations in IL-10, 
      IFNGR1 and BDNF were associated with anxious/depressive symptoms in early-stage
      breast cancer patients in China, which could help identify patients at high risk

AB  - Since the "seed and soil" hypothesis was proposed, the biological functions of
      the tumor microenvironment (TME), especially its stromal components, have
      received increasing attention. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the major
      components of the stromal region, providing material support for tumor cell
      proliferation, migration, and invasion. Furthermore, CAFs are important mediators
      of suppressing immune responses by attracting the accumulation of
      immunosuppressive cells through cytokine/chemokine secretion. In this review, we 
      summarized the major cytokines, chemokines and metabolites, including
      transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-X-C chemokine
      ligand (CXCL)12, C-C chemokine ligand (CCL) 2, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and other
      factors, by which CAFs suppress the immune systems in a variety of cancers. More 
      importantly, we highlight potential therapeutic strategies to alleviate the
      immunosuppression produced by CAFs, thereby inhibiting tumor progression.

AB  - Vaccination is one of the most powerful strategies for the preventive and
      therapeutic control of infectious diseases and other diseases such as cancer. To 
      maximize the effectiveness of vaccines, it is necessary to modify the immune
      responses by means of adjuvants. The gut environment, including commensal
      bacteria and dietary components, has been proven to be able to mediate host
      immunity. An understanding of gut microbiota-related regulation of immune
      responses has revealed the potential adjuvanticity of particular
      microbiota-derived compounds, driving exploration into their development as
      vaccine adjuvants. In this review, we discuss how commensal bacteria and
      compounds derived from them regulate host immune responses, and we propose the
      potential application of these compounds as vaccine adjuvants.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Tumor cells release fragments of their DNA into the circulation, so
      called cell-free tumor DNA (ctDNA) or liquid biopsy. Here, we analyze if
      cell-free human papillomavirus DNA (ctHPV DNA) is detectable before, during and
      after treatment, in patients with cervical cancer or pre-malignant lesions that
      may develop into cervical cancer, and whether ctHPV DNA levels were correlated to
      patient or tumor characteristics and outcome. Furthermore, total cell-free DNA
      load is studied using cfAlbumin DNA as a surrogate marker. METHODS: 18 patients
      with locally advanced CC (LACC), 15 patients with early stage CC (ESCC) and 21
      patients with pre-malignant lesions, all with verified HPV16, 18 or 45-positive
      lesions, were included. Pre- during- and post-treatment plasma were tested for
      HPV16, 18 & 45 and total cfDNA load using droplet digital PCR. RESULTS: ctHPV DNA
      was found in 94.4% and 26.7% of pre-treatment plasma of patients with LACC and
      ESCC respectively, while all samples from patients with pre-malignant lesions
      were negative. Higher levels of ctHPV DNA were correlated to higher FIGO2018
      stage. Patients with LACC and persistent ctHPV DNA at end-of-treatment had
      significantly worse progression-free survival (PFS) than patients who had cleared
      the ctHPV DNA (p = 0.007). Patients with total ctDNA-levels above median in
      pre-treatment plasma had a worse PFS (p = 0.026), compared to patients with total
      ctDNA-levels below median. CONCLUSION: ctHPV DNA is a promising prognostic
      biomarker in locally advanced cervical cancer that should be studied further for 
      clinical use.

TI  - A novel cell line panel reveals non-genetic mediators of platinum resistance and 
      phenotypic diversity in high grade serous ovarian cancer.
LID - S0090-8258(22)00511-X [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ygyno.2022.07.027 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Resistance to cancer therapy is an enduring challenge and accurate
      and reliable preclinical models are lacking. We interrogated this unmet need
      using high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) as a disease model. METHODS: We
      created five in vitro and two in vivo platinum-resistant HGSC models and
      characterised the entire cell panel via whole genome sequencing, RNASeq and
      creation of intraperitoneal models. RESULTS: Mutational signature analysis
      indicated that platinum-resistant cell lines evolved from a pre-existing
      ancestral clone but a unifying mutational cause for drug resistance was not
      identified. However, cisplatin-resistant and carboplatin-resistant cells evolved 
      recurrent changes in gene expression that significantly overlapped with
      independent samples obtained from multiple patients with relapsed HGSC. Gene
      Ontology Biological Pathways (GOBP) related to the tumour microenvironment,
      particularly the extracellular matrix, were repeatedly enriched in
      cisplatin-resistant cells, carboplatin-resistant cells and also in human
      resistant/refractory samples. The majority of significantly over-represented GOBP
      however, evolved uniquely in either cisplatin- or carboplatin-resistant cell
      lines resulting in diverse intraperitoneal behaviours that reflect different
      clinical manifestations of relapsed human HGSC. CONCLUSIONS: Our clinically
      relevant and usable models reveal a key role for non-genetic factors in the
      evolution of chemotherapy resistance. Biological pathways relevant to the
      extracellular matrix were repeatedly expressed by resistant cancer cells in
      multiple settings. This suggests that recurrent gene expression changes provide a
      fitness advantage during platinum therapy and also that cancer cell-intrinsic
      mechanisms influence the tumour microenvironment during the evolution of drug
      resistance. Candidate genes and pathways identified here could reveal therapeutic
      opportunities in platinum-resistant HGSC.

TI  - Pulmonary Sialadenoma Papilliferum and Its Mimics: What You Need to Know.
LID - 10.1111/his.14733 [doi]
AB  - Pulmonary salivary gland-type tumors (SGT) represent a small but distinct group
      of primary lung neoplasms. These types of tumors originate from the submucosal
      bronchial glands of the tracheobronchial tree. Pulmonary SGTs differ greatly in
      the incidence of individual tumors from salivary gland tumors of the head and
      neck. Additionally, the vast majority of pulmonary SGT are malignant. Recently,
      pathologic diagnosis has significantly improved with the application of molecular
      diagnostic technologies. However, the current knowledge of benign SGTs is
      limited; moreover, tumor diversity and overlapping morphological features of SGT 
      represent diagnostic challenges such as correct tumor categorization and their
      accurate differentiation from malignant lesions. Compounding this inherent
      difficulty has been the recent introduction of new variants, including
      sialadenoma papilliferum (SP). Pulmonary SP is very rare, with limited reports
      available, and most of the initial diagnoses rendered so far were incorrect,
      resulting in inappropriate treatment. Several cases of SP have recently been
      reported. This review will serve to update practicing pathologists on the
      morphology, immunophenotype, and molecular characteristics of SP and its mimics.

TI  - Targeting the extra domain A of fibronectin for cancer therapy with CAR-T cells.
LID - e004479 [pii]
LID - 10.1136/jitc-2021-004479 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: One of the main difficulties of adoptive cell therapies with chimeric
      antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells in solid tumors is the identification of specific 
      target antigens. The tumor microenvironment can present suitable antigens for CAR
      design, even though they are not expressed by the tumor cells. We have generated 
      a CAR specific for the splice variant extra domain A (EDA) of fibronectin, which 
      is highly expressed in the tumor stroma of many types of tumors but not in
      healthy tissues. METHODS: EDA expression was explored in RNA-seq data from
      different human tumor types and by immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded
      tumor biopsies. Murine and human anti-EDA CAR-T cells were prepared using
      recombinant retro/lentiviruses, respectively. The functionality of EDA CAR-T
      cells was measured in vitro in response to antigen stimulation. The antitumor
      activity of EDA CAR-T cells was measured in vivo in C57BL/6 mice challenged with 
      PM299L-EDA hepatocarcinoma cell line, in 129Sv mice-bearing F9 teratocarcinoma
      and in NSG mice injected with the human hepatocarcinoma cell line PLC. RESULTS:
      EDA CAR-T cells recognized and killed EDA-expressing tumor cell lines in vitro
      and rejected EDA-expressing tumors in immunocompetent mice. Notably, EDA CAR-T
      cells showed an antitumor effect in mice injected with EDA-negative tumor cells
      lines when the tumor stroma or the basement membrane of tumor endothelial cells
      express EDA. Thus, EDA CAR-T administration delayed tumor growth in
      immunocompetent 129Sv mice challenged with teratocarcinoma cell line F9. EDA
      CAR-T treatment exerted an antiangiogenic effect and significantly reduced gene
      signatures associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition, collagen synthesis,
      extracellular matrix organization as well as IL-6-STAT5 and KRAS pathways.
      Importantly, the human version of EDA CAR, that includes the human 41BB and
      CD3zeta endodomains, exerted strong antitumor activity in NSG mice challenged
      with the human hepatocarcinoma cell line PLC, which expresses EDA in the tumor
      stroma and the endothelial vasculature. EDA CAR-T cells exhibited a tropism for
      EDA-expressing tumor tissue and no toxicity was observed in tumor bearing or in
      healthy mice. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that targeting the
      tumor-specific fibronectin splice variant EDA with CAR-T cells is feasible and
      offers a therapeutic option that is applicable to different types of cancer.

TI  - Uncovering SARS-COV-2 vaccine uptake and COVID-19 impacts among First Nations,
      Inuit and Metis Peoples living in Toronto and London, Ontario.
PG  - E1018-E1026
LID - 10.1503/cmaj.212147 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: First Nations, Inuit and Metis Peoples across geographies are at
      higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 because of high rates of chronic
      disease, inadequate housing and barriers to accessing health services. Most
      Indigenous Peoples in Canada live in cities, where SARS-CoV-2 infection is
      concentrated. To address gaps in SARS-CoV-2 information for these urban
      populations, we partnered with Indigenous agencies and sought to generate rates
      of SARS-CoV-2 testing and vaccination, and incidence of infection for First
      Nations, Inuit and Metis living in 2 Ontario cities. METHODS: We drew on existing
      cohorts of First Nations, Inuit and Metis adults in Toronto (n = 723) and London 
      (n = 364), Ontario, who were recruited using respondent-driven sampling. We
      linked to ICES SARS-CoV-2 databases and prospectively monitored rates of
      SARS-CoV-2 testing, diagnosis and vaccination for First Nations, Inuit and Metis,
      and comparator city and Ontario populations. RESULTS: We found that SARS-CoV-2
      testing rates among First Nations, Inuit and Metis were higher in Toronto (54.7%,
      95% confidence interval [CI] 48.1% to 61.3%) and similar in London (44.5%, 95% CI
      36.0% to 53.1%) compared with local and provincial rates. We determined that
      cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was not significantly different
      among First Nations, Inuit and Metis in Toronto (7364/100 000, 95% CI 2882 to 11 
      847) or London (7707/100 000, 95% CI 2215 to 13 200) compared with city rates. We
      found that rates of vaccination among First Nations, Inuit and Metis in Toronto
      (58.2%, 95% CI 51.4% to 64.9%) and London (61.5%, 95% CI 52.9% to 70.0%) were
      lower than the rates for the 2 cities and Ontario. INTERPRETATION: Although
      Ontario government policies prioritized Indigenous populations for SARS-CoV-2
      vaccination, vaccine uptake was lower than in the general population for First
      Nations, Inuit and Metis Peoples in Toronto and London. Ongoing access to
      culturally safe testing and vaccinations is urgently required to avoid
      disproportionate hospital admisson and mortality related to COVID-19 in these
      communities.

AB  - We describe the case of a woman in her 50s with abdominal pelvic masses suspected
      to be an ovarian lesion with metastases. At laparoscopy, it appeared as a
      possible abdominal location of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1). A 50 cm of small 
      bowel was resected to remove multiple nodular lesions. On histopathology, small
      bowel lesions (n=14) were all classified as GISTs. Clinicians should recognise
      and consider gastrointestinal manifestations of NF-1 in the diagnostic flow
      chart. Surgical treatment may resolve symptomatic cases and prevent local
      infiltration or malignant degeneration of abdominal neoplasms occurring in
      patients with NF-1.

AB  - We present a rare complication of microwave ablation (MWA) in a male patient in
      his 80s. His massive pulmonary necrosis and tension pneumothorax required urgent 
      surgery. However, the damage to the lung tissue was too large, deep and fragile. 
      We failed to suture or conduct wedge resection on the lung lesion, so, left upper
      lobectomy was necessary. Therefore, we suggest that it is probably possible to
      reduce the frequency and time threshold when performing MWA for the elderly with 
      comorbidities.

TI  - Elevated TSH level, TgAb and prior use of ramucirumab or TKIs as risk factors for
      thyroid dysfunction in PD-L1 blockade.
LID - dgac467 [pii]
LID - 10.1210/clinem/dgac467 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Thyroid dysfunction is frequently caused by treatment with
      anti-programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 antibodies (PD-L1-Abs) as well as
      anti-cancer drugs, including ramucirumab (RAM) and multi-targeted tyrosine kinase
      inhibitors (multi-TKIs), which are often used prior to PD-L1-Ab treatment in
      cancer patients. METHODS: A total of 148 patients treated with PD-L1-Abs were
      evaluated for anti-thyroid antibodies at baseline and for thyroid function every 
      six weeks for 24 weeks after treatment initiation and then were observed until
      the visits stopped. RESULTS: Of the 148 patients, 15 (10.1%) developed thyroid
      dysfunction after PD-L1-Ab treatment (destructive thyroiditis in eight and
      hypothyroidism without preceding thyrotoxicosis in seven). The prevalences of an 
      elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level at baseline (3/15 [20.0%] vs.
      4/133 [3.0%], p < 0.05), positive anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb) at
      baseline (4/15 [26.7%] vs. 5/133 [3.8%], p < 0.05) and prior treatment with RAM
      or multi-TKIs (3/15 [20.0%] vs. 5/133 [3.8%], p < 0.05) were significantly higher
      in patients with versus without thyroid dysfunction. In a multivariate analysis, 
      elevated TSH level at baseline, TgAb positivity at baseline and prior treatment
      with RAM or multi-TKIs were significantly associated with the development of
      thyroid dysfunction, with odds ratios of 7.098 (95% confidence interval [CI],
      1.154-43.638), 11.927 (95% CI, 2.526-56.316) and 8.476 (95% CI, 1.592-45.115),
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this real-world study suggest that the 
      risk of thyroid dysfunction induced by PD-L1-Abs can be predicted by the TSH
      level at baseline, TgAb positivity at baseline and prior treatment with RAM or
      multi-TKIs.

TI  - Variation in the diagnosis of noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with
      papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP).
LID - dgac466 [pii]
LID - 10.1210/clinem/dgac466 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Noninvasive encapsulated follicular variant of papillary thyroid cancer 
      (EFVPTC) was reclassified as noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with
      papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP) in January 2017. The impact of this
      nomenclature change at a population level remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: Examine use
      of NIFTP across different US regions and populations. DESIGN: Descriptive
      epidemiology study using SEER-22 data (2000-2019). PARTICIPANTS: Individuals
      diagnosed with papillary or follicular thyroid cancer (2000-2019), or NIFTP
      (2017-2019). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Annual incidence rates of thyroid cancer by
      subtype and NIFTP. Using 2018-2019 data: 1) rates of NIFTP at the 17 SEER-22
      sites, and 2) comparison of demographics for patients diagnosed with NIFTP versus
      papillary and follicular thyroid cancer. RESULTS: NIFTP comprised 2.2% and 2.6%
      of cases in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Between 2018-2019, large heterogeneity
      was observed in the regional use of NIFTP diagnosis, with site-specific incidence
      rates between 0.0-6.2% (median 2.8%, IQR 1.3-3.6%). A diagnosis of NIFTP (vs
      papillary and follicular thyroid cancer) was significantly associated with older 
      age (P=0.012 and P=0.009), Black race (both P<0.001), and non-Hispanic ethnicity 
      (both P<0.001) for 2018 and 2019, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Marked variation
      exists in the use of the NIFTP diagnosis. The recent 2021 coding change that
      resulted in NIFTP, a tumor with uncertain malignant potential and for which there
      is no long-term outcome data available, no longer being a reportable diagnosis to
      SEER will disproportionately affect vulnerable patient groups such as older
      patients and Black patients, in addition to patients who reside in regions with
      higher rates of NIFTP diagnoses.

TI  - Epidemiology, outcomes and predictors of mortality in patients transported by
      ambulance for dyspnoea: A population-based cohort study.
LID - 10.1111/1742-6723.14053 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: There are currently limited data to inform the management of patients
      transported by emergency medical services (EMS) with dyspnoea. We aimed to
      describe the incidence, aetiology and outcomes of patients transported by EMS for
      dyspnoea using a large population-based sample and to identify factors associated
      with 30-day mortality. METHODS: Consecutive EMS attendances for dyspnoea in
      Victoria, Australia from January 2015 to June 2019 were included. Data were
      individually linked to hospital and mortality records to determine incidence,
      diagnoses, and outcomes. Factors associated with 30-day mortality were assessed
      using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: During the study period, there 
      were 2 505 324 cases attended by EMS, of whom 346 228 (14%) met inclusion
      criteria for dyspnoea. The incidence of EMS attendances for dyspnoea was 1566 per
      100 000 person-years, and was higher in females, older patients and socially
      disadvantaged areas. Of the 271 204 successfully linked cases (median age 76
      years; 51% women), 79% required hospital admission with a 30-day mortality of 9%.
      The most common final diagnoses (and 30-day mortality rates) were lower
      respiratory tract infection (13%, mortality 11%), chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease (13%, mortality 6.4%), heart failure (9.1%, mortality 9.8%), arrhythmias 
      (3.9%, mortality 4.4%), acute coronary syndromes (3.9%, mortality 9.5%) and
      asthma (3.2%, mortality 0.5%). Predictors of mortality included older age, male
      sex, pre-existing chronic kidney disease, heart failure or cancer, abnormal
      respiratory status or vital signs and pre-hospital intubation. CONCLUSION:
      Dyspnoea is a common presentation with a broad range of causes and is associated 
      with high rates of hospitalisation and death.

TI  - Ionizing radiation triggers the antitumor immunity by inducing GSDME-mediated
      pyroptosis in tumor cells.
LID - S0360-3016(22)02596-2 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2022.07.1841 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To understand pyroptosis induced by ionizing radiation and its
      implications for radiotherapy, we explored the involved factors, possible
      mechanisms of radiation-induced pyroptosis and consequent antitumor immunity.
      METHODS AND MATERIALS: The occurrence of pyroptosis was assessed by cell
      morphology, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, Annexin V/PI staining and the
      cleavage of GSDME. Cell radiosensitivity was tested with MTT and colony survival 
      assays. Xenograft tumor volume, Ki-67, CD8(+) lymphocytes and ELISA were used to 
      evaluate the effect of GSDME on tumor suppression after irradiation. RESULTS:
      Irradiation induced pyroptosis in GSDME high-expressing tumor cell lines covering
      lung, liver, breast and glioma cancers. Cleavage of GSDME occurred in a dose- and
      time-dependent manner after irradiation, and pyroptosis could be induced by
      various kinds of irradiation. The combination of chemotherapy drugs for DNA
      damage (cisplatin or etoposide) or demethylation (decitabine or azacytidine) and 
      irradiation significantly enhanced the occurrence of pyroptosis. Moreover, we
      revealed that the Caspase 9/Caspase 3/GSDME pathway was involved in
      irradiation-induced pyroptosis. Notably, enhanced tumor suppression was observed 
      in Balb/c mice bearing GSDME-overexpressing 4T1 tumors compared to those bearing 
      vector tumors for the promotion of antitumor immunity, which was manifested as
      distinctly elevated levels of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and release of the related 
      cytokines rather than the direct effect of pyroptosis on tumor cell
      radiosensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: As an immunogenic cell death caused by radiation, 
      pyroptosis promotes antitumor immunity after irradiation. Our findings may
      provide new insights to improve the efficacy of tumor radiotherapy.

      Carriers for Prostate Cancer Procedures.
LID - S0360-3016(22)02597-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2022.07.1839 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Variation in commercial insurance coverage may lead to disparity in
      access to quality cancer care. We evaluated commercial insurance coverage
      determinations to assess the degree of variation across a national sample.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified the predominant carrier of commercial
      insurance in each state based on the 2020 U.S. Government Accounting Office
      (GAO-21-34) report on insurance. For each state, publicly available medical
      policies from 1/1/2021 to 1/31/2021 were analyzed for coverage of 3 widely
      accepted procedures: hydrogel spacer, fluciclovine PET, and intensity modulated
      radiation (IMRT) in low volume metastatic prostate cancer. RESULTS: We analyzed
      83 commercial medical policies across 51 States and District of Columbia. There
      was widespread variation in coverage policy. Hydrogel spacer was determined
      medically necessary in 9 states, mixed coverage in 8, not medically necessary in 
      22, and no available public policy in 12. Use of fluciclovine-PET required a
      minimum prostate specific antigen (PSA) level of 2 ng/mL in 9 states, 1 ng/mL in 
      17, any PSA in 7, mixed coverage in 12, and no publicly available policy in 6.
      IMRT in low volume metastatic prostate cancer was medically necessary in 17
      states, not necessary in 7, and not stated in 27. Insurance carriers often used
      external utilization management (UM) companies such as AIM-Healthcare and Evicore
      Healthcare. These determinations were more restrictive than carriers which did
      not use UM. CONCLUSION: Commercial medical policies vary widely in medical
      necessity determinations for novel prostate cancer treatment procedures that are 
      FDA-approved and covered by Medicare. These data suggest a need for more
      consistent methodology for medical necessity determination to mitigate the
      current state where patients have unequal access to cancer procedures due to the 
      location of residence and age.

AB  - AIM: To investigate the relationship between circulating growth-differentiation
      factor (GDF-15) levels and the risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer in
      people with diabetes. METHODS: Totally, 510 participants with type 2 diabetes
      were enrolled from the long-term follow-up of the Da Qing Impaired Glucose
      Tolerance (IGT) and Diabetes Study (2006-2009). Plasma GDF-15 levels were
      assessed. Outcomes of cardiovascular events, cancer, and related death were
      followed up until 2016. RESULTS: Over a 7.5-year follow-up period, 143 (28.0%) of
      the participants died, and 155 and 56 experienced cardiovascular events and
      cancer respectively. Multivariable Cox analysis showed that higher circulating
      GDF-15 levels were significantly associated with the increased risk of
      cardiovascular and cancer death. The HRs after adjustment of traditional
      confounders were 1.90 (95% CI 1.31-2.74) and 2.50 (95% CI 1.34-4.67) respectively
      for an increase in one unit of loge transformed GDF-15 (pg/ml). The
      cause-specific hazard model analysis further confirmed the results after
      adjusting the same confounders. In addition, the higher GDF-15 levels were also
      significantly associated with the increased risk of cardiovascular events
      (HR=1.35, 95% CI: 1.04-1.76) and cancer (HR=1.62, 95% CI 1.06-2.47). CONCLUSIONS:
      Elevated circulating levels of GDF-15 predicted a significant increase in the
      dual risk of cancer and cardiovascular diseases in Chinese people with type 2
      diabetes. Thus, it may be a potential predictor of these outcomes in people with 
      diabetes.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the clinical outcomes and risk factors of mortality in
      patients with rheumatic diseases complicated by Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP).
      METHODS: During November 2015 and April 2021, patients with rheumatic diseases
      with PCP in a tertiary referral hospital were retrospectively enrolled. The
      diagnosis of PCP requires the fulfillment of clinical, radiographic, and
      microbiological criteria. Factors associated with in-hospital, 30-day, and 90-day
      mortality were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 128 patients with rheumatic
      diseases who had a positive quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay for
      Pneumocystis jirovecii were screened, and 72 patients were included in the final 
      analysis. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) pneumonia severity index (PSI)
      was 101.5 (77.0-132.0). The median (IQR) adjunctive corticosteroid dosage was 0.6
      (0.4-0.9) mg/kg/day prednisolone equivalent. The receiver operating
      characteristic curve analysis showed that the optimal cut-off point of median
      adjunctive corticosteroid dosage was 0.6 mg/kg/day to predict in-hospital,
      30-day, and 90-day mortality. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, 
      median adjunctive corticosteroid dosage >/= 0.6 mg/kg/day and PSI > 90 were
      independent factors of in-hospital, 30-day, and 90-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: A 
      median adjunctive corticosteroid dosage of >/= 0.6 mg/kg/day might be associated 
      with mortality in patients with rheumatic diseases complicated by PCP.

AB  - There is a long-held consensus that several proteins are unique to small
      extracellular vesicles (EVs), such as exosomes. However, recent studies have
      shown that several of these markers can also be present in other subpopulations
      of EVs to a similar degree. Furthermore, few markers have been identified as
      enriched or uniquely present in larger EVs, such as microvesicles. The aim of
      this study was to address these issues by conducting an in-depth comparison of
      the proteome of large and small EVs. Large (16,500 x g) and small EVs (118,000 x 
      g) were isolated from three cell lines using a combination of differential
      ultracentrifugation and a density cushion and quantitative mass spectrometry
      (TMT-LC-MS/MS) was used to identify differently-enriched proteins in large and
      small EVs. In total, 6493 proteins were quantified, with 818 and 1567 proteins
      significantly enriched in small and large EVs, respectively. Tetraspanins, ADAMs 
      and ESCRT proteins, as well as SNAREs and Rab proteins associated with endosomes 
      were enriched in small EVs compared to large EVs, whereas ribosomal,
      mitochondrial and nuclear proteins, as well as proteins involved in cytokinesis, 
      were enriched in large EVs compared to small EVs. However, Flotillin-1 was not
      differently expressed in large and small EVs. In conclusion, our study shows that
      the proteome of large and small EVs are substantially dissimilar. We validated
      several proteins previously suggested to be enriched in either small or large EVs
      (e.g. ADAM10 and Mitofilin, respectively), and we suggest several additional
      novel protein markers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Motor vehicle collisions remain a leading cause of unintentional
      injury deaths among children in the United States. despite the proven
      effectiveness of child restraint systems (CRS). Laws and public education
      campaigns have fallen short of ensuring child passenger safety guideline
      adherence (i.e., correct use of a size-appropriate CRS in the back seat on every 
      trip) across the population. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial will test 
      the efficacy of Tiny Cargo, Big Deal!/Abrochame Bien, Cuidame Bien (TCBD/ABCB), a
      precision prevention intervention, grounded in Self-Determination Theory, that
      integrates motivational interviewing and tailored eHealth components to promote
      child passenger safety guideline adherence over the course of one year. Using
      in-person and remote recruitment, we seek to enroll 900 English or
      Spanish-speaking adult caregivers of children 6 months to 10 years of age who
      sought emergency or urgent care and screened non-adherent to child passenger
      safety guidelines. Eligible caregivers provide informed consent and complete a
      baseline assessment before randomization. At 6 months, only intervention group
      participants who remain non-adherent are re-randomized to standard or enhanced
      intervention. We assess caregiver-submitted photographs throughout the year using
      the Child Passenger Safety Score and provide personalized feedback. The primary
      outcome of guideline adherence is assessed at 12-months. The trial has been
      registered with clinicaltrials.gov: NCT04238247. IMPLICATIONS: We hypothesize
      TCBD/ABCB will be more efficacious than enhanced usual care for promoting
      guideline adherence at 12-month follow-up. The intervention is expected to
      benefit children in families who have not responded to legal requirements and
      population-based strategies for child passenger safety.

      induced by space radiation in US astronauts.

AB  - This article explores the role that oxygen levels in US spacecraft from 1961 to
      1998 have on the development of cataracts induced by space radiation in
      astronauts and whether oxygen levels are well accounted for in experimental
      studies examining cataractogenesis. The first epidemiological report in 2001
      linked an increased risk of the primary types of cataracts, and nuclear cataract 
      alone, for astronauts with higher lens doses. However, later studies of US
      astronauts in 2009 and 2012 reported a higher risk of cortical cataract and
      posterior subcapsular cataract, but not nuclear cataract. Firstly, it is
      postulated that the high oxygen level atmospheres of spacecraft employed before
      1976 were a factor in promoting nuclear cataract. The high oxygen levels of
      hyperbaric oxygen therapy are reportedly associated with nuclear cataract, and
      the low intraocular oxygen levels of diabetic patients are possibly linked to
      their higher risk of posterior subcapsular cataract and cortical cataract.
      Secondly, it is hypothesized that the normal hypoxic environment of the lens and 
      lens epithelial cells (LECs), and all stem/progenitor cells in general, have an
      optimal Goldilocks range of oxygen levels. Too high a lenticular oxygen level
      increases oxidative stress and radiosensitivity due to the oxygen effect. Whereas
      too low an oxygen tension also increases oxidative stress and disrupts LEC
      differentiation. Even so, a focused literature search of the PubMed database of
      in vitro experiments with LECs shows that studies rarely account for the hypoxic 
      state of the normal lens, whether ionizing radiation is a factor or not. It is
      therefore recommended that ocular physioxic levels should therefore be considered
      when designing in vitro studies to better understand the progression of
      cataractogenesis on long-duration missions to the Moon and Mars.

      critical analysis.

LID - 10.1016/j.yrtph.2022.105235 [doi]
AB  - The concept of the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) was introduced in the seventies
      for carcinogenicity testing and was defined as the highest dose inducing clear
      toxicity, but not mortality by causes other than cancer. As estimation of the MTD
      in a carcinogenicity study, the highest dose that causes a 10% decrease in body
      weight compared to control animals over the course of a 90-day study, was
      formulated as a suitable criterion. This criterion was not seen as indicator of
      excessive toxicity but as a means to avoid false negative outcomes in a
      carcinogenicity study, as tumor formation may be reduced when body weight is
      significantly decreased. The body weight-based MTD criterion, however, turned up 
      in carcinogenicity test guidelines and guidance (e.g., from OECD) as the highest 
      dose that causes a 10% decrease in body weight gain relative to controls.
      Moreover, the 10% decrease in body weight gain criterion for MTD also ended up in
      test guidelines and guidances for toxicity endpoints other than carcinogenicity, 
      so outside the context it was intended for. A 10% decrease in body weight gain
      relative to controls is however not a biologically relevant effect as it
      corresponds to less than 3% body weight reduction relative to controls in a
      90-day study, which is within the normal variation in body weight. It therefore
      should certainly not be considered as a condition of excessive toxicity. Using
      the 10% lower weight gain criterion and incorrectly associating it with excessive
      toxicity has major implications for top dose selection in regulatory safety
      studies, resulting in tests performed at doses too low to elicit toxicity. This
      negatively impacts the reliability of studies and their regulatory usability;
      moreover, it results in a waste of experimental animals, which is ethically
      highly undesirable. Hence, our plea is to remove this MTD criterion for top dose 
      selection in test guidelines and guidances for toxicity endpoints other than
      carcinogenicity and to reinstall the original 10% decrease in body weight
      criterion in test guidelines and guidances for carcinogenicity.

      and severely limits its application. In this study, we constructed several
      recombinant proteins by fusing the albumin binding domain mutant
      ABD035(abbreviated as ABD) to the N- or C-terminus of TCS to endow the
      recombinant TCS fusion protein with a longer half-life property binding with
      endogenous human serum albumin (HSA) via ABD to effectively exert its anti-tumor 
      activity in vivo. Pull down, Dynamic light scattering and ELISA assays all showed
      that TCS fused with two ABD sequences at the C-terminus of TCS, has stronger
      binding capacity to HSA in vitro than TCS with one ABD. In vivo studies in BALB/C
      mice were performed and the elimination half-life of TCS-ABD-ABD is about 15-fold
      longer compared to TCS and anti-tumor activity is about 30% higher than that of
      TCS alone in BALB/C mouse experiments. Moreover, we found that TCS with two ABDs 
      in tandem have the highest soluble expression level, more than 5 times higher
      than that of TCS, and the yield of purified protein of TCS-ABD-ABD was as high as
      68.9mg/L culture solution, which was about 7-fold higher than that of TCS.
      Furthermore, MTT assay showed that the anti-tumor activity of TCS-ABD-ABD was
      significantly higher than TCS fused with only one ABD sequence, indicating that
      the repeated ABD sequences facilitated the biological activity of TCS. In this
      paper, the fusion of the albumin-binding domain in tandem with TCS can
      effectively improve its stability in vivo and also significantly increase its
      soluble expression, expanding the application of the albumin-binding domain in
      the high soluble expression and stability of protein drugs.

AB  - Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by the complex tumor
      microenvironment (TME), consisting of an abundance of stromal cells. Among them, 
      tumor infiltrating T cells play a pivotal role in tumor progress. To identify the
      full spectrum and developmental trajectory of T cells and their crosstalk with
      tumor cells in PDAC, we conducted scRNA-seq analysis based on multiple datasets
      from our institution and open databases. We delineated the cellular landscape and
      transcriptional dynamics of T cells in PDAC. Through the inferCNV analysis and
      known tumor markers, the malignant ductal cells were identified. The
      inter-patients heterogeneity of tumor cells was also identified. After
      integrating T cells and malignant ductal cells, we found the CCL5-SDC1/4
      receptor-ligand interactions between them. Furthermore, we demonstrated that CCL5
      promoted tumor cells migration via interacting with SDC1 in vitro. Our findings
      pave the way for characterizing the heterogeneity and development trajectory of T
      cells, and cell-to-cell communications in TME of PDAC, which might provide a new 
      target for immunotherapy.

AB  - Increasing evidence have revealed that epigenomic and genomic factors jointly
      contribute to malignancy of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). However,
      little is known regarding how enhancers regulate tumor suppressors and drive the 
      tumorigenesis of ESCC. Here, we characterized S100A14 as a tumor suppressor in
      ESCC and showed that S100A14 deficiency dramatically promoted
      4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4NQO) -induced tumorigenesis of ESCC and shortened
      survival of mice. Intriguingly, we found that S100A14 expression was driven by
      enhancer, and disruption of enhancer decreased S100A14 expression in ESCC.
      Mechanistic investigation showed that S100A14 deficiency induces aberrant
      differentiated program. TP63, SOX2 and EP300 occupied the enhancer region of
      S100A14 gene locus and regulated the expression of S100A14. Consistently, S100A14
      is downregulated in ESCC tissues compared with their corresponding adjacent
      normal tissues, and lower S100A14 expression predicts poorer overall survival.
      Collectively, disruption of enhancer-regulated S100A14 induces ESCC tumorigenesis
      and it acts as a critical driver of ESCC tumorigenesis.

AB  - Asthma, COPD, COVID-19, EGPA, Lung cancer, and Pneumonia are major chronic
      respiratory diseases (or CRDs) affecting millions worldwide and account for
      substantial morbidity and mortality. These CRDs are irreversible diseases that
      affect different parts of the respiratory system, imposing a considerable burden 
      on different socio-economic classes. All these CRDs have been linked to increased
      eosinophils in the lungs. Eosinophils are essential immune mediators that
      contribute to tissue homeostasis and the pathophysiology of various diseases.
      Interestingly, elevated eosinophil level is associated with cellular processes
      that regulate airway hyperresponsiveness, airway remodeling, mucus
      hypersecretion, and inflammation in the lung. Therefore, eosinophil is considered
      the therapeutic target in eosinophil-mediated lung diseases. Although,
      conventional medicines like antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs, and
      bronchodilators are available to prevent CRDs. But the development of resistance 
      to these therapeutic agents after long-term usage remains a challenge. However,
      progressive development in nanotechnology has unveiled the targeted nanocarrier
      approach that can significantly improve the pharmacokinetics of a therapeutic
      drug. The potential of the nanocarrier system can be specifically targeted on
      eosinophils and their associated components to obtain promising results in the
      pharmacotherapy of CRDs. This review intends to provide knowledge about
      eosinophils and their role in CRDs. Moreover, it also discusses nanocarrier drug 
      delivery systems for the targeted treatment of CRDs.

AB  - Anti-angiogenesis targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2
      (VEGFR2) has been considered an important strategy for cancer therapy. VEGFR2
      inhibitors targeting tumor angiogenic pathways have been widely used in clinical 
      cancer treatment. However, inherent or acquired resistance to anti-angiogenic
      drugs may occur and thus limit their clinical application. New VEGFR2 inhibitors 
      are still highly demanded. The aim of this study was to investigate
      VEGFR2-targeted artemisinin (ARS)-type compounds for cancer treatment. Here, we
      report the ARS derivative FO-ARS-123 as a novel VEGFR2 inhibitor, which displayed
      potent binding activity with VEGFR2 in in silico by molecular docking (pKi,
      0.40+/-0.31nM) and in vitro by microscale thermophoresis (Kd, 1.325+/-0.055muM). 
      In addition, compound FO-ARS-123 displayed a strong inhibition on cell
      proliferation of a broad range of cancer cells as well as suppressed cell
      migration and invasion. Remarkably, FO-ARS-123 exerted profound anti-angiogenesis
      effects in the in vitro tube formation assay and in vivo CAM assay. These results
      suggest that FO-ARS-123 might be a novel and promising anti-angiogenesis agent
      for cancer treatment.

      adverse events. It is urgent to develop more effective, tolerable and safe drugs 
      for the treatment of OS. Andrographolide (AG), a diterpenoid lactone isolated
      from Andrographis paniculata, has been proved to possess anti-tumor activity
      against several human cancer types. In this current study, we evaluated the
      inhibitory effect of AG on human OS cells and probed the possible mechanism. We
      found that AG inhibited the proliferation of human OS cells and blocked cell
      cycle at G2/M phase. Furthermore, AG impeded the migration and invasion, while
      promoted the apoptosis of human OS cells. Moreover, we found that AG inhibited OS
      growth and lung metastasis in orthotopic transplantation model. Mechanistically, 
      we demonstrated that AG suppressed the activity of Wnt/beta-catenin, PI3K/AKT and
      NF-kappaB signaling pathways. Notably, we validated that AG synergized with the
      inhibitors of Wnt/beta-catenin, PI3K/AKT and NF-kappaB to suppress the
      proliferation, migration and invasion of human OS cells. Collectively, our study 
      conclusively demonstrates that AG inhibits the growth of human OS cells, thus,
      may be a promising candidate for the treatment of OS.

AB  - Cells are exposed to several environmental or chemical stressors that may cause
      DNA damage. DNA damage alters the normal functioning of the cell and contributes 
      to several diseases, including cancer. Cells either induce DNA damage repair
      pathways or programmed cell death pathways to prevent disease formation depending
      on the severity of the stress and the damage caused. The DNA repair mechanisms
      are crucial to maintaining genome stability. During this adaptive response, the
      heat shock proteins (HSPs) are the key players. HSPs are overexpressed during
      genotoxic stress, but the role of different molecular players in the interaction 
      between HSPs and DNA repair proteins is still poorly understood. As DNA damage
      promotes genomic instability and proteotoxic stress, modulating the protein
      quality control systems like the HSPs network could be a promising strategy for
      targeting disease pathologies associated with genomic instability, such as
      cancer. Hence, this review highlights the role of HSPs in DNA repair pathways.
      Further, the review also provides an outlook on the role of genomic instability
      and protein homeostasis in cancer, which is crucial to understanding the
      mechanisms behind its survival and developing novel targeted therapies.

TI  - Allergic sensitisation impairs lung resident memory CD8 T cell response and virus
      clearance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Asthma patients often suffer from frequent respiratory viral
      infections and reduced virus clearance. Lung resident memory T cells provide
      rapid protection against viral re-infections. OBJECTIVE: As development of
      resident memory T cells relies on the lung microenvironment, we investigated the 
      impact of allergen sensitisation on the development of virus-specific lung
      resident memory T cells and viral clearance. METHODS: Mice were sensitised with
      house dust mite extract followed by priming with X47 and a subsequent secondary
      influenza infection. Anti-viral memory T cell responses and protection to viral
      infection was assessed pre- and post-secondary influenza infection, respectively.
      Gene set variation analysis was performed on datasets from U-BIOPRED asthma
      cohort using an IFN-induced epithelial cell signature and a tissue resident
      memory T cell signature. RESULTS: Viral loads were higher in lungs of sensitised 
      compared to non-sensitised mice post-secondary infection, indicating reduced
      virus clearance. X47 priming induced fewer anti-viral lung resident memory CD8 T 
      cells and resulted in lower pulmonary IFN levels in the lungs of sensitised as
      compared to non-sensitised mice. Using data from the U-BIOPRED cohort, we found
      that patients with enrichment of epithelial IFN-induced genes in nasal brushings 
      and bronchial biopsies were also enriched in TRM associated genes, had more
      epithelial CD8 T cells and reported significantly fewer exacerbations.
      CONCLUSION: The allergen sensitised lung microenvironment interferes with the
      formation of anti-viral resident memory CD8 T cells in lungs and virus clearance.
      Defective anti-viral memory response might contribute to increased susceptibility
      of asthma patients to viral exacerbations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Endometrial cancer (EC) is one of the most prevalent gynecological
      cancers with a 5-year survival rate of 20-60%. Feasible prognostic molecular
      biomarkers of EC are necessary for accurate prediction of EC prognosis. METHODS: 
      RAC3 is a member of the Rho GTPases. Public databases including Gene Expression
      Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA2), Tumor Immune Estimation Resource
      (TIMER), LinkedOmics, Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins
      (STRING), TISIDB and cBioPortal were employed to analyze the differential
      expression, clinicopathologic characteristics, functional networks, immune cell
      infiltrates and genetic alteration of RAC3 in EC patients. RESULTS: RAC3
      expression was elevated in EC patients analyzed by TIMER and GEPIA.
      Overexpression of RAC3 was obviously correlated with clinical stage, histological
      type, histological grade and DNA hypomethylation. Patients with high RAC3
      expression displayed poor overall survival. Functional enrichment analysis showed
      that RAC3 was involved in translational initiation, DNA replication and mRNA
      processing. RAC3 expression was negatively associated with infiltrating levels of
      B cells, CD8+ T cells, macrophages and dendritic cells in EC. Experiments in
      vitro showed that RAC3 was upregulated in EC tissues and cell lines, and RAC3
      induced cell proliferation and invasion by increasing fatty acid synthase (FASN) 
      expression. CONCLUSION: High expression of RAC3iscorrelated with poor prognosis
      and low infiltration of immune cells in EC. RAC3 promotes cell proliferation and 
      invasion via FASN. These results demonstrate thatRAC3 functions as an EC oncogene
      and reveal its underlying mechanism in EC progression, suggesting that RAC3 may
      serve as a potential therapeutic target in EC.

TI  - Structures and mechanisms of the Arabidopsis auxin transporter PIN3.
LID - 10.1038/s41586-022-05142-w [doi]
AB  - The PIN-FORMED (PIN) protein family of auxin transporters mediates the polar
      auxin transport and plays crucial roles in plant growth and development(1,2).
      Here we present cryo-EM structures of PIN3 from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtPIN3) in 
      the apo state and in complex with its substrate indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and
      the inhibitor N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) at 2.6-3.0 A resolution. AtPIN3
      exists as a homodimer, with the transmembrane helices (TMs) 1, 2, and 7 in the
      scaffold domain involved in dimerization. The dimeric AtPIN3 forms a large, joint
      extracellular-facing cavity at the dimer interface while each subunit adopts an
      inward-facing conformation. The structural and functional analyses, along with
      computational studies, reveal the structural basis for the recognition of IAA and
      NPA and elucidate the molecular mechanism of NPA inhibition on the PIN-mediated
      auxin transport. The AtPIN3 structures support an elevator-like model for the
      transport of auxin, whereby the transport domains undergo up-down rigid-body
      motions and the dimerized scaffold domains remain static.

AB  - Since 1995, photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been utilized as an effective method
      for cancer treatment. However, the residues of photosensitizers in the normal
      tissues after PDT can be activated by sunlight to cause severe skin
      phototoxicity, for which currently there are no clinical solutions. As a result, 
      post-PDT patients need to remain out of sunlight for up to five weeks, which
      produces great living and mental burdens for patients. Herein, we report that a
      biocompatible porous organic polymer (POP) with average 3.1 nm porosity is able
      to suppress the skin phototoxicity of clinically used porphyrin-based
      photodynamic agents (PDAs), including Photofrin, Talaporfin and Hiporfin, through
      an adsorption-elimination mechanism. Fluorescence titration and dialysis
      experiments show that POP can adsorb and retain the PDAs at a micromolar
      concentration. In vivo experiments demonstrate that POP can significantly
      suppress the skin phototoxicity caused by all the three PDAs without reducing
      their PDT efficacy. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: : Up to now, no efficient clinical
      treatment for the inhibition of post-PDT phototoxicity of clinically used
      porphyrin-based PDAs is available. In the manuscript, a water-soluble cationic
      porous organic polymer has been revealed to include three clinically used PDAs.
      In vivo experiments show that this inclusion remarkably reduces the content of
      PDAs in mouse skins, leading to significant alleviation of their post-PDT
      phototoxicity without no negative effect on their PDT efficacy. Thus, this work
      provides a strategy for overcoming the drawback of clinically used photodynamic
      agents.

      Hypoxic Solid Tumors.

AB  - Tumor microenvironment (TME)-oriented nanomedicine emerges as an efficient
      routine to greatly improve the efficiency of cancer treatment. The typical
      feature of hypoxia in TME remains as the main obstacle of many therapeutics like 
      photodynamic therapy. Herein, a specific two-dimensional (2D) phototheranostics
      (GO-MnO2@/tLyP-1/Ce6, denoted as GMtC) with the function of oxygen self-producing
      and tumor barrier-breaking was detailed by integrating the nanoenzyme MnO2
      colloids, tumor homing-penetrating peptide tLyP-1 and photosensitizer chlorin e6 
      (Ce6) to tackle the hypoxic tumors. GMtC was capable to accumulate into the inner
      of murine mammary 4T1 tumor spheroids (and the depth could be as far as 90 mum)
      and to relieve the hypoxia state by catalytic decomposition of endogenous H2O2 to
      oxygen, which subsequently enhanced the yield of cytotoxic singlet oxygen under
      laser irradiation. In vivo dual-modal imaging of magnetic resonance and
      biofluorescence demonstrated the targeted accumulation and distribution of GMtC
      in tumor regions, thus facilitating the tumor hypoxia alleviation. Notably, GMtC 
      achieved the highest photodynamic anticancer efficiency against 4T1 tumors
      without obvious systemic toxicity compared with the non-penetrating and no
      oxygen-generating counterparts. This study suggests the great promise of GMtC as 
      an endogenous TME-responsive and exogenous laser-triggered theranostic platform
      against the solid hypoxic tumors. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: : The hostile tumor 
      hypoxia not only induces the tumor angiogenesis, invasiveness and irreversible
      metastasis, but also inherently impairs the efficiency of many therapeutic
      modalities like photodynamic therapy (PDT). Though numerous hypoxia-alleviating
      strategies based on nanomedicine have been proposed, little attention is paid to 
      the hypoxia-specific transportation barriers. This study develops a type of 2D
      phototheranostics GMtC against hypoxic solid tumors by integrating the function
      of tumor homing-penetrating and nanoenzyme in situ oxygen-generating. GMtC
      displays outstanding performance in tumor deep penetration to hypoxia center and 
      generating abundant oxygen in responsive to tumor microenvironment, thus exerting
      the highest efficiency of PDT against 4T1 mammary tumor. GMtC can be a potent
      theranostics to treat the solid hypoxic tumors.

TI  - Use of Glucocorticoids in Patients with Cancer: Potential Benefits, Harms, and

AB  - PURPOSE: Glucocorticoids are commonly used in patients with cancer for symptom
      relief or as part of their anti-cancer treatment. Despite their frequent use,
      indications and dosing regimens are not exclusively evidence-based and can come
      with a multitude of adverse effects, some of which can be life-threatening. The
      objective of this review is to update our current state of knowledge on the use
      of glucocorticoids in adult patients with cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A
      comprehensive literature review (1949-2022) was conducted using search terms
      "glucocorticoids," "corticosteroids," and "cancer." Information was organized by 
      main concepts including indications, potential benefits, prevention and
      management of common side effects of glucocorticoid therapy, in addition to
      appropriate dosing and taper regimens. RESULTS: Glucocorticoids can be highly
      effective in improving outcomes and quality of life in patients with cancer.
      Their uses include management of disease manifestations, symptoms, and
      complications of cancer treatment. The lowest effective dose should be used and
      treatment duration should be minimized as clinically feasible. Side effects can
      be minimized by careful monitoring, continued assessment of benefits versus
      harms, and preventative measures for expected side effects. CONCLUSIONS: This
      review provides general principles and practical recommendations on the use of
      glucocorticoids in patients with cancer. Further prospective studies on the
      outcomes of patients on glucocorticoids may help guide practice.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Mufangji decoction (MFJD), a famous traditional
      Chinese medicine formula in Synopsis of Golden Chamber (Jingui yaolue), has been 
      utilized to treat cough and asthma and release chest pain over 2000 years in
      China. Chinese old herbalist doctor use MFJD to treat lung cancer and cancerous
      pleural fluid, but the preventive effect of MFJD on lung cancer and the
      underlying mechanism are indefinite. AIM OF THE STUDY: The goal of this study is 
      to explore the efficacy and mechanism of Mufangji decoction preventing lung
      cancer referring to the traditional use. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tumor allograft
      experiment and host versus tumor experiment were used to observe the direct
      anti-tumor effect and indirect anti-tumor immune effect, the mouse lung
      carcinogenic model was used to evaluate the dose-response and the preventive
      effect of MFJD on lung cancer. The active ingredients of MFJD were obtained by
      UPLC-MS/MS. The potential targets of MFJD were screened by network pharmacology
      and transcriptomics. The therapeutic targets and pathways of MFJD on lung cancer 
      were obtained by protein-protein interaction, molecular docking and David
      database. The predicted results were verified in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: MFJD
      could significantly prevent tumor growth in host versus tumor experiment but
      could not in tumor allograft experiment, indicating an anti-tumor immune effect
      against lung cancer. MFJD could reduce lung nodules with a dose-response in mouse
      lung carcinogenic model. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) was selected as the core target
      due to the highest degree value in Protein-Protein interaction network and had
      potently binding activity to sinomenine and dehydrocostus lactone in molecular
      docking. In vivo, MPO-expressed neutrophils are negatively correlated with lung
      cancer progression and MFJD could promote the neutrophil-related immune
      surveillance. In vitro, sinomenine and dehydrocostus lactone could promote
      neutrophil phagocytosis, MPO and ROS production in a dose dependent manner. The
      major compounds from MFJD were identified to regulate 36 targets for lung cancer 
      prevention by UPLC-MS/MS, network pharmacology and transcriptomics. David
      database exhibited that MFJD plays an important role in immunoregulation by
      modulating 4 immune-related biological processes and 3 immune-related pathways.
      CONCLUSIONS: MFJD prevents lung cancer by mainly promoting MPO expression to
      maintain neutrophil immune surveillance, its key compounds are sinomenine and
      dehydrocostus lactone.

TI  - Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy versus Conventional External Beam Radiation
      Therapy for Painful Bone Metastases: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of
      Randomized Trials.

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy and safety of stereotactic body radiation
      therapy (SBRT) and conventional external beam radiation therapy (cEBRT) in
      patients with previously unirradiated painful bone metastases (BM). METHODS: We
      searched biomedical databases for eligible randomized trials (RCTs). The outcomes
      of interest were pain response, local progression, overall survival (OS) and
      adverse events. We used established tools to assess the quality of the individual
      trials and certainty of the pooled evidence. We performed meta-analyses using
      random effects models. RESULTS: Six RCTs were identified. SBRT improved complete 
      pain response rates at 3 months (OR, 3.38; 95% CI, 1.88-6.07; high certainty),
      reduced local progression rates (OR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.06-0.62; high certainty) and
      increase pain flare rates. There were no differences for other outcomes.
      CONCLUSION: Among patients with previously unirradiated painful BM, SBRT
      significantly improved complete pain response rates at 3 months, delayed local
      progression and increase pain flare rates.

      checkpoint blockers in solid tumors: a systematic review.

AB  - Immunotherapy is a standard of care in many solid tumors but many patients derive
      limited benefit from it. There is increasing interest toward tumor infiltrating
      lymphocytes (TILs) since their presence may be related with good outcomes from
      treatment with immune checkpoint blockers. We aimed at systematically reviewing
      existing evidence about the role of TILs as possible predictors of response to
      immunotherapy in solid tumors. We reviewed 1193 records published from January
      2010 until December 2021. Associations between TILs and outcomes were observed
      mainly in melanoma and breast cancer. Overall survival and overall response rate 
      for advanced disease and pathological complete response for early-phase tumors
      were the most commonly assessed endpoints. No definitive conclusion can be drawn 
      on the predictive role of TILs. Additional studies, exploiting data from
      prospective, randomized clinical trials should further evaluate TILs also with
      the aim of identifying standard cut-off to differentiate between high and low
      TILs.

AB  - We report on the third Assisi Think Tank Meeting (ATTM) on breast cancer, a
      brainstorming project which involved European radiation and clinical oncologists 
      who were dedicated to breast cancer research and treatment. Held on February
      2020, the ATTM aimed at identifying key clinical questions in current clinical
      practice and "grey" areas requiring research to improve management and outcomes. 
      Before the meeting, three key topics were selected: 1) managing patients with
      frailty due to either age and/or multi-morbidity; 2) stereotactic radiation
      therapy and systemic therapy in the management of oligometastatic disease; 3)
      contralateral breast tumour prevention in BCRA-mutated patients. Clinical
      practice in these areas was investigated by means of an online questionnaire. In 
      the lapse period between the survey and the meeting, the working groups reviewed 
      data, on-going studies and the clinical challenges which were then discussed
      in-depth and subjected to intense brainstorming during the meeting; research
      protocols were also proposed. Methodology, outcome of discussions, conclusions
      and study proposals are summarized in the present paper. In conclusion, this
      report presents an in-depth analysis of the state of the art, grey areas and
      controversies in breast cancer radiation therapy and discusses how to confront
      them in the absence of evidence-based data to guide clinical decision-making.

AB  - Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is treated as a monolithic disease despite the
      evident intra- and intertumoral heterogeneity. Non-specific DNA-damaging agents
      have remained the first-line treatment for decades. Recently, emerging
      transcriptomic and genomic profiling of SCLC tumors identified distinct SCLC
      subtypes and vulnerabilities towards targeted therapeutics, including inhibitors 
      of the nuclear enzyme poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARPi). SCLC cell lines and
      tumors exhibited an elevated level of PARP1 protein and mRNA compared to healthy 
      lung tissues and other subtypes of lung tumors. Notable responses to PARPi were
      also observed in preclinical SCLC models. Clinically, PARPi monotherapy exerted
      variable benefits for SCLC patients. To date, research is being vigorously
      conducted to examine predictive biomarkers of PARPi response and various PARPi
      combination strategies to maximize the clinical utility of PARPi. This narrative 
      review summarizes existing preclinical evidence supporting PARPi monotherapy,
      combination therapy, and respective translation to the clinic. Specifically, we
      covered the combination of PARPi with DNA-damaging chemotherapy (cisplatin,
      etoposide, temozolomide), thoracic radiotherapy, immunotherapy (immune checkpoint
      inhibitors), and many other novel therapeutic agents that target DNA damage
      response, tumor microenvironment, epigenetic modulation, angiogenesis, the
      ubiquitin-proteasome system, or autophagy. Putative biomarkers, such as SLFN11
      expression, MGMT methylation, E2F1 expression, and platinum sensitivity, which
      may be predictive of response to distinct therapeutic combinations, were also
      discussed. The future of SCLC treatment is undergoing rapid change with a focus
      on tailored and personalized treatment strategies. Further development of cancer 
      therapy with PARPi will immensely benefit at least a subset of biomarker-defined 
      SCLC patients.

AB  - Free radicals are highly reactive molecules with short lifetime which are now
      well accepted to act as regulators for different signaling pathways and hence can
      affect various cellular processes. Furthermore, they play pivotal role in
      different physiological/pathophysiological processes including homeostasis,
      metabolism, immunity, proliferation, differentiation, and cancer. Meanwhile, free
      radicals play a positive role in pathogen resistance that any imbalances in their
      productions/regulation could be harmful to cell macromolecules such as proteins, 
      lipids, and nucleic acids and finally cells' fate, which may be results in
      different diseases. Some modalities, especially in cancer therapy, are based on
      ROS elevation/decreasing. Based on the inevitable importance of ROS various
      detection methods have been developed. These methods should have fundamental
      criteria including cell-permeability and physiological pH compatibility. In this 
      review first we will bring up about different free radicals, their role in
      diseases, and underlying signaling pathways; after that various detection methods
      with their pros and cons will be discussed.

AB  - Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) is a key mediator of
      lipid metabolism and metabolic stress in the liver. A recent study revealed that 
      PPARalpha-dependent long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in
      modulating metabolic stress and inflammation in the livers of fasted mice. Here
      hepatic lncRNA 3930402G23Rik (G23Rik) was found to have active peroxisome
      proliferator response elements (PPREs) within its promoter and is directly
      regulated by PPARalpha. Although G23Rik RNA was expressed to varying degrees in
      several tissues, the PPARalpha-dependent regulation of this lncRNA was only
      observed in the liver. Pharmacological activation of PPARalpha induced PPARalpha 
      recruitment at the G23Rik promoter and a pronounced increase in hepatic G23Rik
      lncRNA expression. A G23Rik-null mouse line was developed to further characterize
      the function of this lncRNA in the liver. G23Rik-null mice were more susceptible 
      to hepatic lipid accumulation in response to acute fasting. Histological analysis
      further revealed a pronounced buildup of lipid droplets and a significant
      increase in neutral triglycerides and lipids as indicated by enhance oil red O
      staining of liver sections. Hepatic cholesterol, non-esterified fatty acid, and
      triglyceride levels were significantly elevated in G23Rik-null mice and
      associated with induction of the lipid-metabolism related gene Cd36. These
      findings provide evidence for a lncRNA dependent mechanism by which PPARalpha
      attenuates hepatic lipid accumulation in response to metabolic stress through
      lncRNA G23Rik induction.

TI  - Automatic Captioning of Early Gastric Cancer via Magnification Endoscopy with
      Narrow Band Imaging.

LID - 10.1016/j.gie.2022.07.019 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Early gastric cancer (EGC) detection rate is unsatisfactory,
      and mastering the diagnostic skills of magnifying endoscopy with narrow-band
      imaging (ME-NBI) requires rich expertise and experience. We aimed to develop an
      EGC captioning model (EGCCap) to automatically describe the visual
      characteristics of ME-NBI images for endoscopists. METHODS: A total of 1886
      ME-NBI images from 294 cases were enrolled from multi-centers, and corresponding 
      5658 text data was designed following the simple EGC diagnostic algorithm. An
      EGCCap was developed using the multi-scale meshed-memory transformer. We
      conducted comprehensive evaluations for EGCCap including the quantitative and
      quality performance, generalization, robustness, interpretability, and assistant 
      value analyses. The commonly used metrics including BLEUs, CIDEr, METEOR, ROUGE, 
      SPICE, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were used. Two-sided statistical
      tests were conducted, and statistical significance was determined when P<0.05.
      RESULTS: EGCCap acquired satisfying captioning performance by outputting
      correctly and coherently clinically meaningful sentences in the internal test
      cohort (BLEU1 = 52.434, CIDEr = 36.734, METEOR = 27.823, ROUGE = 49.949, SPICE = 
      35.548), and it maintained over 80% performance when applied to other centers or 
      corrupted data. The diagnostic ability of endoscopists improved with the
      assistance of EGCCap, which was especially significant (P<0.05) for junior
      endoscopists. Endoscopists gave EGCCap an average remarkable score of 7.182,
      showing acceptance of EGCCap. CONCLUSION: EGCCap exhibited promising captioning
      performance and was proved with satisfying generalization, robustness, and
      interpretability. Our study showed potential value in aiding and improving the
      diagnosis of EGC and facilitating the development of automated reporting in the
      future.

AB  - delta-Opioid receptors (DORs, encoded by the Oprd1 gene) are expressed throughout
      the peripheral and central nervous system, and DOR stimulation reduces
      nociception. Previous studies suggest DORs promote the development of analgesic
      tolerance of mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonists. It is uncertain whether DORs
      expressed in primary sensory neurons are involved in regulating chronic pain and 
      MOR agonist-induced tolerance. In this study, we generated Oprd1 conditional
      knockout (Oprd1-cKO) mice by crossing Advillin-Cre mice with Oprd1-floxed mice.
      DOR expression in the dorsal root ganglion was diminished in Oprd1-cKO mice.
      Systemic or intrathecal injection of the DOR agonist SNC-80 produced analgesia in
      wild-type (WT), but not Oprd1-cKO, mice. In contrast, intracerebroventricular
      injection of SNC-80 produced a similar analgesic effect in WT and Oprd1-cKO mice.
      However, morphine-induced analgesia, hyperalgesia, or analgesic tolerance did not
      differ between WT and Oprd1-cKO mice. Compared with WT mice, Oprd1-cKO mice
      showed increased mechanical and heat hypersensitivity after nerve injury or
      tissue inflammation. Furthermore, blocking DORs with naltrindole increased
      nociceptive sensitivity induced by nerve injury or tissue inflammation in WT, but
      not Oprd1-cKO, mice. In addition, naltrindole potentiated glutamatergic input
      from primary afferents to spinal dorsal horn neurons increased by nerve injury or
      CFA in WT mice; this effect was absent in Oprd1-cKO mice. Our findings indicate
      that DORs in primary sensory neurons are critically involved in the analgesic
      effect of DOR agonists but not morphine-induced analgesic tolerance. Presynaptic 
      DORs at primary afferent central terminals constitutively inhibit inflammatory
      and neuropathic pain by restraining glutamatergic input to spinal dorsal horn
      neurons.

AB  - Cichorium intybus, commonly called chicory, has been widely used as a coffee
      substitute. It display a wide range of natural compounds and medicinally uses in 
      treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. This study synthesized silver
      nanoparticles (Ci-AgNPs) using C. intybus leaf-derived callus extract to evaluate
      phytochemical content, antibacterial, antioxidant and anti-proliferative
      activities against human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB231). The optimal shape, size
      and stability of Ci-AgNPs was confirmed using UV-visible spectrophotometry,
      FESEM, EDX, XRD, DLS, Zeta potential, FTIR and sp-ICP-MS studies. The
      antibacterial activity of Ci-AgNPs was assessed using disk diffusion method
      against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, and they displayed distinct
      zones of inhibition. Colorimetric phytochemical analysis of Ci-AgNPs revealed
      their higher total phenolic (TP) and total flavonoid (TF) content. Ci-AgNPs also 
      indicated a high level of antioxidant activity using FRAP and DPPH assays. The
      Ci-AgNPs were investigated for their anticancer activities on the cancerous
      MDA-MB231 cells viability and apoptosis using MTT and flow cytometry,
      respectively. Ci-AgNPs showed dose dependent cytotoxicity against MDA-MB231 cells
      with IC50 value of 187.6 mug/mL at 48h through induction of apoptosis. The
      biocompatibility test showed that Ci-AgNPs induced neglectable cytotoxicity
      (lower than 3%) toward human erythrocytes. This is the first study that reports

AB  - Developing targeted drug delivery systems is an urgent need to decrease the side 
      effects and increase the drug's efficiency. Most cancer cells show an increased
      sugar consumption compared to healthy cells due to the deregulation of sugar
      transporters. Consequently, liposomes, as a biocompatible nanocarrier, could be
      surface decorated by sugars to enhance drug targeting into cancer cells. Our work
      outlines a new strategy to easily manufacture sucrose decorated liposomes using
      sucrose stearate, a biocompatible and biodegradable non-ionic surfactant, with a 
      scalable microfluidic approach. Sucrose decorated liposomes were loaded with
      berberine hydrochloride, a well-known phytochemical compound to investigate its
      effects on triple-negative breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231). Using the
      microfluidic manufacturing system, we prepared berberine-loaded liposomes using a
      mixture of phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol with and without sucrose stearate 
      with a size up to 140 nm and narrow polydispersity. Stability was confirmed for
      90 days, and the in vitro release profile was evaluated. The formulations showed 
      acceptable in vitro biocompatibility and significantly higher anti-proliferative 
      effect on MDA-MB-231 cell line. These results have been confirmed by an increased
      uptake evaluated by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Taken together, our
      findings represent an innovative, easy, and scalable approach to obtain sugar
      decorated liposomal formulations without any surface-chemistry reactions. They
      can be potentially used as an anticancer targeted drug delivery system.

TI  - Dexmedetomidine versus clonidine as an adjuvant to local anaesthetic in brachial 
      plexus blocks: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.
LID - S0104-0014(22)00085-9 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.bjane.2022.07.005 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of
      dexmedetomidine and clonidine as an adjuvant to local anesthetics in BPBs.
      METHODS: Two investigators independently searched databases to identify all RCTs 
      comparing the efficacy and/or safety of dexmedetomidine and clonidine as an
      adjuvant to local anesthetics in BPBs. All outcomes were pooled using the inverse
      variance method with a random-effect model. An I(2) test was used to assess
      heterogeneity. The source of heterogeneity was explored through meta-regression. 
      The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. RESULTS: Out
      of 123 full texts assessed, 24 studies (1448 patients) were included in the
      analysis. As compared to clonidine, dexmedetomidine groups showed significantly
      longer sensory block duration (MD=173.31; 95% CI 138.02208.59; I(2)=99%; GRADE
      approach evidence: high); motor block duration (MD=158.35; 95% CI 131.55185.16;
      I(2)=98%; GRADE approach evidence: high), duration of analgesia (MD=203.92; 95%
      CI 169.25238.58; I(2)=99%; GRADE approach evidence- high), and provided higher
      grade quality of block (RR=1.97; 95% CI 1.602.41; I(2)=0%; GRADE approach
      evidence: moderate). The block positioning technique (regression coefficient:
      51.45, p=0.005) was observed as a significant predictor of the heterogeneity in
      the case of sensory block duration. No significant difference was observed for
      the risk of hypotension (RR=2.59; 95% CI 0.6310.66; I(2)=%). CONCLUSION: Moderate
      to high-quality evidence suggests dexmedetomidine is a more efficacious adjuvant 
      to local anesthetic in BPBs than clonidine.

TI  - AI-based decision support improves reproducibility of tumor response assessment
      in neuro-oncology: an international multi-reader study.
LID - noac189 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/neuonc/noac189 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To assess whether AI-based decision support allows more reproducible 
      and standardized assessment of treatment response on MRI in neuro-oncology as
      compared to manual 2-dimensional measurements of tumor burden using the RANO
      criteria. METHODS: A series of 30 patients (15 lower-grade gliomas, 15
      glioblastoma) with availability of consecutive MRI scans was selected. The time
      to progression (TTP) on MRI was separately evaluated for each patient by 15
      investigators over two rounds. In the 1 st round the TTP was evaluated based on
      the RANO-criteria, whereas in the 2 nd round the TTP was evaluated by
      incorporating additional information from AI-enhanced MRI-sequences depicting the
      longitudinal changes in tumor volumes. The agreement of the TTP-measurements
      between investigators was evaluated using concordance correlation coefficients
      (CCC) with confidence intervals (CI) and p-values obtained using bootstrap
      resampling. RESULTS: The CCC of TTP-measurements between investigators was 0.77
      (95%CI=0.69,0.88) with RANO alone and increased to 0.91 (95%CI=0.82,0.95) with
      AI-based decision support (p=0.005). This effect was significantly greater
      (p=0.008) for patients with lower-grade gliomas (CCC=0.70 [95%CI=0.56,0.85]
      without vs. 0.90 [95%CI=0.76,0.95] with AI-based decision support) as compared to
      glioblastoma (CCC=0.83 [95%CI=0.75,0.92] without vs. 0.86 [95%CI=0.78,0.93] with 
      AI-based decision support). Investigators with less years of experience judged
      the AI-based decision as more helpful (p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: AI-based decision
      support has the potential to yield more reproducible and standardized assessment 
      of treatment response in neuro-oncology as compared to manual 2-dimensional
      measurements of tumor burden, particularly in patients with lower-grade gliomas.

TI  - Design and Rationale of the HANSE Study: A Holistic German Lung Cancer Screening 
      Trial Using Low-Dose Computed Tomography.
LID - 10.1055/a-1853-8291 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the high prevalence and mortality of lung cancer and proven
      effectiveness of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) to reduce mortality, Germany
      still lacks a national screening program. The German Institute for Quality and
      Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) and the Federal Office for Radiation Protection
      (BfS) both published positive scientific evaluations recommending a
      quality-controlled national screening program. IQWiG underlined the importance of
      a clear risk definition, integrated smoking cessation programs, and quality
      assurance, highlighting the necessity of procedural optimization. METHODS AND
      OBJECTIVES: In the HANSE study, former and current smokers aged 55-79 years are
      assessed for their lung cancer risk by the NELSON and PLCOM2012 risk scores. 5000
      high-risk participants, defined as PLCOM2012 6-year risk >/= 1.58 % or fulfilling
      NELSON risk inclusion criteria, will be screened by LDCT at baseline and after 12
      months. Lung nodules are analyzed by a modified Lung-RADS 1.1 score of the HANSE 
      study, and values of emphysema and coronary calcium are determined and randomly
      reported to the participants. 7100 low-risk participants serve as a control. All 
      patients are followed-up for up to 10 years. The sensitivity and specificity of
      the two risk assessments and LDCT screening, effects of the randomized LDCT
      reporting, efficiency of lung nodule management, and several other factors are
      assessed to analyze the success and quality of the holistic screening program.
      CONCLUSION: The HANSE study is designed as a holistic lung cancer screening study
      in northern Germany to answer pressing questions for a successful implementation 
      of an effective German lung cancer screening program. KEY POINTS: . HANSE is
      designed to address pressing questions for the implementation of lung cancer
      screening in Germany.. . HANSE compares NELSON and PLCOM2012 risk assessments for
      optimal definition of the high-risk group. . . HANSE integrates cardiac calcium
      and pulmonary emphysema scoring in a holistic screening approach.. CITATION

      on a Public Database.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is one of the deadliest cancers, early diagnosis of which
      can efficiently enhance patient's survival. We aimed to screening out the serum
      miRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers for patients with lung cancer. METHODS: A total
      of 416 remarkably differentially expressed miRNAs were acquired using the limma
      package, and next feature ranking was derived by the
      minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance method. An incremental feature selection
      algorithm of a random forest (RF) classifier was utilized to choose the top 5
      miRNA combination with the optimum predictive performance. The performance of the
      RF classifier of top 5 miRNAs was analyzed using the receiver operator
      characteristic (ROC) curve. Afterward, the classification effect of the 5-miRNA
      combination was validated through principal component analysis and hierarchical
      clustering analysis. Analysis of top 5 miRNA expressions between lung cancer
      patients and normal people was performed based on GSE137140 dataset, and their
      expression was validated by qPCR. The hierarchical clustering analysis was used
      to analyze the similarity of 5 miRNAs expression profiles. ROC analysis was
      undertaken on each miRNA. RESULTS: We acquired top 5 miRNAs finally, with the
      Matthews correlation coefficient value as 0.988 and the area under the curve
      (AUC) value as 0.996. The 5 feature miRNAs were capable of distinguishing most
      cancer patients and normal people. Furthermore, except for the lowly expressed
      miR-6875-5p in lung cancer tissue, the other 4 miRNAs all expressed highly in
      cancer patients. Performance analysis revealed that their AUC values were 0.92,
      0.96, 0.94, 0.95, and 0.93, respectively. CONCLUSION: By and large, the 5 feature
      miRNAs screened here were anticipated to be effective biomarkers for lung cancer.

TI  - Functional tumor diameter measurement with Molecular Breast Imaging: development 
      and clinical application.
LID - 10.1088/2057-1976/ac85f0 [doi]
AB  - Purpose:Molecular breast imaging (MBI) is used clinically to visualize the uptake
      of(99m)Tc-sestamibi in breast cancers. Here, we use Monte Carlo simulations to
      develop a methodology to estimate tumor diameter in focal lesions and explore a
      semi-automatic implementation for clinical data.Methods:A validated Monte Carlo
      simulation of the GE Discovery NM 750b was used to simulate >75,000 unique
      spherical/ellipsoidal tumor, normal breast, and image acquisition conditions.
      Subsets of this data were used to 1) characterize the dependence of the
      full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of a tumor profile on tumor, normal breast, and
      acquisition conditions, 2) develop a methodology to estimate tumor diameters, and
      3) quantify the diameter accuracy in a broad range of clinical conditions.
      Finally, the methodology was implemented in patient images and compared to
      diameter estimates from physician contours on MBI, mammography, and ultrasound
      imaging.Results:Tumor profile FWHM was determined be linearly dependent on tumor 
      diameter but independent of other factors such as tumor shape, uptake, and
      distance from the detector. A linear regression was used to calculate tumor
      diameter from the FWHM estimated from a background-corrected profile across a
      tumor extracted from a median-filtered single-detector MBI image, i.e., diameter 
      = 1.2 mm + 1.2 x FWHM, for FWHM >/= 13 mm. Across a variety of simulated clinical
      conditions, the mean error of the methodology was 0.2 mm (accuracy), with >50% of
      cases estimated within 1-pixel width of the truth (precision). In patient images,
      the semi-automatic methodology provided the longest diameter in 94% (60/64) of
      cases. The estimated true diameters, for oval lesions with homogeneous uptake,
      differed by +/- 5 mm from physician measurements.Conclusion:This work
      demonstrates the feasibility of accurately quantifying tumor diameter in clinical
      MBI, and to our knowledge, is the first to explore its implementation and
      application in patient data.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the outcome of dual-vessel intervention (DVI), including
      bronchial or pulmonary arterial embolization (B/PAE), in managing massive
      hemoptysis caused by cavitary lung lesions (with or without aspergilloma) and
      identify cavitary angiographic features influencing DVI procedures. METHOD: A
      retrospective analysis of the medical records and angiograms of 15 patients who
      underwent DVI for massive hemoptysis was performed. RESULTS: The most frequent
      causes of cavitary lung lesions were tuberculosis (TB) (8/15, 53%) and
      bronchiectasis (6/15, 40%). Eight patients were diagnosed with aspergilloma
      (8/15, 53%). In all, 24 systemic arteries, including the orthotopic and ectopic
      bronchial arteries and 1 pulmonary artery branch, were embolized in 16
      procedures. Clinical success and immediate cessation of hemoptysis were achieved 
      in 12 patients (80%). Hemoptysis was controlled in 10 patients (67%) and recurred
      in 2 patients (17%), while 1 patient (7%) required repeat embolization. The
      bronchopulmonary fistula (shunting) rate was 73.3% (11/15). The average fistula
      emergence time was 1.28 +/- 1.27 s (M +/- SD), and the average vessel diameter
      was 3.974 +/- 1.57 mm. There were no significant differences in angiographic
      features, clinical success, or recurrence of cavitary lesions with or without
      aspergilloma. The complication rates were low, with only transient chest pain and
      ventricular arrhythmia reported. CONCLUSIONS: BAE is an effective and safe
      procedure for most cavitary lesions causing massive hemoptysis, and DVI is needed
      under certain circumstances. High bronchopulmonary fistula rates and early
      fistula emergence times were observed for cavitary lesions. The DVI strategy
      depends on the culprit vessel diameter, fistula type, and fistula emergence time.

AB  - Stimulus-responsive self-assembling prodrug-based nanomedicine has emerged as a
      novel paradigm in controlled drug delivery. All-trans retinoic acid (RA), one of 
      vitamin A metabolites, induces apoptotic cancer cell death, but its clinical
      applications are limited by weak anticancer efficacy. To fully maximize the
      therapeutic potential of RA, we exploited the unique chemistry of arylboronic
      acid which undergoes hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-triggered degradation to release
      quinone methide (QM) that alkylates glutathione (GSH) to disrupt redox
      homeostasis and is also converted into hydroxybenzyl alcohol (HBA) to suppress
      the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Here, we report that
      boronated retinoic acid prodrug (RABA) can be formulated into self-deliverable
      nanoassemblies which release both RA and QM in a H2O2-triggered self-immolative
      manner to exert cooperative anticancer activities. RABA nanoassemblies exert
      anticancer effects by inducing reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated apoptosis, 
      eliciting immunogenic cell death (ICD) and suppressing angiogenic VEGF
      expression. The excellent anticancer efficacy of RABA nanoassemblies can be
      explained by benefits of self-assembling prodrug-based drug self-delivery and
      cooperative anticancer actions. The design strategy of RABA would provide a new
      insight into the rational design of self-deliverable and self-immolative
      boronated prodrug nanoassemblies for targeted cancer therapy.

AB  - Killing tumor cells efficiently with photothermal therapy remains a huge
      challenge. In this study, we successfully prepared a novel polymer with
      photothermal conversion capability via a condensation reaction, and then
      subjected it to Polyethylene glycol (PEG) modification and ultrasonic
      nanocrystalline treatment to make it suitable for in vivo photothermal therapy
      applications. The conjugated polymer demonstrated good biocompatibility and
      photothermal conversion ability and was shown in cell experiments to be effective
      in killing tumor cells after laser irradiation. In addition, the conjugated
      polymer-based photothermal therapy, guided by photoacoustic real-time imaging and
      mediated by laser irradiation, of a tumor-bearing mouse model could effectively
      inhibit the growth of tumor tissue and demonstrated good in vivo biosafety. Thus,
      photothermal therapy based on the conjugated polymer synthesized in this study
      provides a new idea and strategy for the treatment of lung cancer.

AB  - Lapatinib (L) and fulvestrant (F) are used in targeted anticancer therapies, in
      particular, against phenotypically different breast cancer cells. L, a dual
      inhibitor of EGFR and HER2 tyrosine kinases, is active against HER2-positive
      breast cancer cells, while F, a selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD), is
      active against ER-positive breast cancer cells. However, the action of L and F
      can be limited due to their relatively low water solubility and bioavailability. 
      In the present study, poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimer G3 was functionalized
      with L or F or L and F to compare their effects with free L or F against breast
      cancer cells with different receptor status (ER-positive MCF-7, triple negative
      MDA-MB-231 and HER2-positive SK-BR-3 cells). L-PAMAM and F-PAMAM conjugates
      potentiated cytostatic and cytotoxic action of L and F that was accompanied by
      elevated levels of autophagy. TRDMT1, RNA methyltransferase, was also involved in
      this response as judged by TRDMT1 nuclear translocation and nano-drug resistance 
      of TRDMT1 gene knockout cells. Nano-drugs also promoted elimination of
      doxorubicin-induced senescent breast cancer cells by apoptosis-mediated senolysis
      regardless of receptor status. In conclusion, we propose a novel anticancer
      approach based on L-PAMAM and F-PAMAM nanoplatforms being effective, at least,
      against breast cancer cells with different phenotypic features.

AB  - The overwhelming potential of porous coordination polymers (PCP), also known as
      Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs), especially their nanostructures for various
      biomedical applications, have made these materials worth investigating for more
      applications and uses. MOFs unique structure has enabled them for most
      applications, particularly in biomedical and healthcare. A number of very
      informative review papers are available on the biomedical applications of MOFs
      for the reader's convenience. However, many of those reviews focus mainly on drug
      delivery applications, and no significant work has been reported on other MOFs
      for biomedical applications. This review aims to present a compact and highly
      informative global assessment of the recent developments in biomedical
      applications (excluding drug-delivery) of MOFs along with critical analysis.
      Researchers have recently adopted both synthetic and post-synthetic routes for
      the fabrication and modification of MOFs that have been discussed and analyzed. A
      critical review of the latest reports on the significant and exotic area of
      bio-sensing capabilities and applications of MOFs has been given in this study.
      In addition, other essential applications of MOFs, including photothermal
      therapy, photodynamic therapy, and antimicrobial activities, are also included.
      These recently grown emergent techniques and cancer treatment options have gained
      attention and require further investigations to achieve fruitful outcomes. MOF's 
      role in these applications has been thoroughly discussed, along with future
      challenges and valuable suggestions for the research community that will help
      meet future demands.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate aspects of image quality, feasibility and patient
      comfort in dedicated spiral breast computed tomography (B-CT) in a large patient 
      cohort. METHODS: This retrospective study was approved by the institutional
      review board. 2418 B-CT scans from 1222 women examined between 04/16/2019 and
      04/13/2022 were analyzed. Patients evaluated their comfort during the
      examination, radiographers carrying out the scans evaluated the patient's
      mobility and usability of the B-CT device, whereas radiologists assessed lesion
      contrast, detectability of calcifications, breast coverage and overall image
      quality. For semi-quantitative assessment, a Likert-Scale was used and
      statistical significance and correlations were calculated using ANOVAs and
      Spearman tests. RESULTS: Comfort, mobility and usability of the B-CT were rated
      each with either "no" or "negligible" complaints in >99%. Image quality was rated
      with "no" or "negligible complaints" in 96.7%. Lesion contrast and detectability 
      of calcifications were rated either "optimal" or "good" in 92.6% and 98.4%.
      "Complete" and "almost complete" breast coverage were reported in 41.9%, while
      the pectoral muscle was found not to be covered in 56.0%. Major parts of the
      breast were not covered in 2.1%. Some variables were significantly correlated,
      such as age with comfort (rho = -0.168, p < .001) and mobility (rho = -0.172, p <
      .001) as well as patient weight with lesion contrast (rho = 0.172, p < .001) and 
      breast coverage (rho = -0.109, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: B-CT provides high image
      quality and contrast of soft tissue lesions as well as calcifications, while
      covering the pre-pectoral areas of the breast remains challenging. B-CT is easy
      to operate for the radiographer and comfortable for the majority of women.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Circular RNA (circRNA), a group of non-coding RNA, is pivotal in the 
      progression of various cancers, including Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).
      Some circRNAs have been reported to be implicated in the progression of NSCLC,
      however, the function and molecular mechanism of hsa_circ_0000317 (circ_0000317) 
      in NSCLC have not been fully understood. METHODS: The significantly
      differentially expressed circRNA in NSCLC tissues, circ_0000317, was screened out
      by microarray. Circ_0000317, microRNA(miR)-494-3p and Phosphatase and Tensin
      Homolog Deleted on Chromosome 10 (PTEN) expressions in NSCLC tissues were
      respectively probed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and
      western blot assay. MTT and Transwell assays were adopted to examine the growth, 
      migration, and invasion of NSCLC cells. Bioinformatics, luciferase reporter gene 
      assay, RNA immunoprecipitation, and RNA pull-down assay were conducted to probe
      the relationships among circ_0000317, miR-494-3p, and PTEN. RESULTS: Circ_0000317
      expression level was reduced in NSCLC tissues and cell lines. Circ_0000317
      expression in NSCLC patients was associated with TNM stage and lymphatic
      metastasis. Circ_0000317 overexpression restrained the proliferation, migration, 
      and invasion of NSCLC cells, but co-transfection of miR-494-3p mimics partially
      reversed this effect. In addition, circ_0000317, was identified as a competitive 
      endogenous RNA, which could sponge miR-494-3p to increase PTEN expression and
      activate PI3K/AKT pathway. CONCLUSION: Circ_0000317, inhibits NSCLC progression
      via modulating miR-494-3p/PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway.

AB  - We explored the self-reported antibiotic stewardship (AS), and infection
      prevention and control (IPC) activities in intensive care units (ICUs) of
      different income settings. A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online 
      questionnaire to collect data about IPC and AS measures in participating ICUs.
      The study participants were Infectious Diseases-International Research Initiative
      (IDI-IR) members, committed as per their institutional agreement form. We
      analyzed responses from 57 ICUs in 24 countries (Lower-middle income (LMI), n =
      13; Upper-middle income (UMI), n = 33; High-income (HI), n = 11). This
      represented (~5%) of centers represented in the ID-IRI. Surveillance programs
      were implemented in (76.9%-90.9%) of ICUs with fewer contact precaution measures 
      in LMI ones (p = 0.02); (LMI:69.2%, UMI:97%, HI:100%). Participation in regional 
      antimicrobial resistance programs was more significantly applied in HI (p = 0.02)
      (LMI:38.4%,UMI:81.8%,HI:72.2%). AS programs are implemented in 77.2% of
      institutions with AS champions in 66.7%. Infectious diseases physicians and
      microbiologists are members of many AS teams (59%&50%) respectively. Unqualified 
      healthcare professionals(42.1%), and deficient incentives(28.1%) are the main
      barriers to implementing AS. We underscore the existing differences in IPC and AS
      programs' implementation, team composition, and faced barriers. Continuous
      collaboration and sharing best practices on APM is needed. The role of regional
      and international organizations should be encouraged. Global support for capacity
      building of healthcare practitioners is warranted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have improved cancer outcomes.
      However, immune-related adverse effects are common. The aim was to investigate
      the incidence of diarrhea and colitis of ICIs alone and in combination with
      chemotherapy or tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), histopathological findings,
      and management. METHODS: Two separate studies, including meta-analyses, were
      performed. Key inclusion criteria were for Study I) phase I-IV trials, and data
      on diarrhea and/or colitis; for Study II) studies describing histopathologic and 
      endoscopic findings and/or biologic treatment for ICI-induced colitis. RESULTS:
      The incidence of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody-induced diarrhea and colitis was 10%
      and 2%, respectively, with no clinically relevant differences between the
      compounds. The CTLA-4 inhibitor, ipilimumab, induced diarrhea and colitis in 33% 
      and 7% of patients, respectively, whereas the incidence of diarrhea and colitis
      following ipilimumab combined with nivolumab was 21%-37% and 4%-8%, depending on 
      regimen. The incidence of all-grade diarrhea following ICIs combined with
      chemotherapy or TKIs was high (17%-56%), whereas only 0.5% of patients developed 
      severe (>/=grade 3) colitis. The main patterns of histopathologic presentation
      after PD-1/CTLA-4 inhibitor mono- or combination therapy were acute and chronic
      active colitis and microscopic colitis-like. Infliximab and vedolizumab were
      equally effective against ICI-induced colitis. CONCLUSION: Expanding treatment
      options include combinations of ICIs and chemotherapy/TKI with a high incidence
      of diarrhea and a low incidence of colitis; thus, a potential risk of
      overtreatment with corticosteroids exists. We suggest a more tailored approach,
      particularly for the management of low-grade diarrhea. Prospective clinical
      trials are needed to refine management.

TI  - Explaining differences in the frequency of lung cancer detection between the
      National Lung Screening Trial and community-based screening in Manchester, UK.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The frequency of lung cancer detection in the Manchester Lung Health 
      Checks (MLHCs), a community-based screening service, was higher than in the
      National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) over two screening rounds. We aimed to
      identify the potential reasons for this difference. METHODS: We analyzed
      individual-level data from NLST and MLHCs, restricting to MLHCs participants who 
      met NLST eligibility criteria. We calculated 'detection ratios' comparing the
      frequency of lung cancer detection in MLHCs vs NLST, first after excluding NLST
      participants ineligible by MLHC eligibility criteria (6-year lung cancer risk >/=
      1.51 %), and then after standardization to remove the influence of different
      distributions of baseline lung cancer risk. RESULTS: Among the 1,079 MLHCs
      participants who met NLST eligibility criteria, 4.7% were diagnosed with lung
      cancer over two screening rounds compared with 1.7% in NLST, giving an initial
      detection ratio of 2.6 (95%CI 2.2-3.0). This was reduced to 2.2 (95%CI 1.3-2.3)
      after imposing the MLHCs eligibility criterion on NLST, and further to 1.6 (95%CI
      1.2-2.1) after removing the influence of different risk distributions. In
      stratified analyses, the standardized detection ratio was particularly elevated
      in individuals who were older, living in areas of high socioeconomic
      disadvantage, or had an FEV/FVC ratio less than 60. CONCLUSIONS: The 2.6-fold
      higher lung cancer detection in the community-based MLHCs vs NLST is partly
      explained by differences in eligibility criteria and baseline risk distributions.
      The residual 60% increase may relate to higher detection in certain risk groups, 
      including older participants, those with more obstructive lung disease, and those
      living in areas of socioeconomic disadvantage.

TI  - Final overall survival data of sintilimab plus pemetrexed and platinum as
      First-Line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC in the 
      Phase 3 ORIENT-11 study.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: In ORIENT-11, first-line sintilimab + pemetrexed-platinum
      significantly improved PFS compared with placebo + pemetrexed-platinum in
      patients with advanced metastatic nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer
      (AMnsqNSCLC). The study met the primary endpoint of PFS as of 15November2019.
      Here we report final survival analysis from ORIENT-11 (NCT03607539) using a
      15September2021 data cutoff. METHODS: Patients with treatment-naive locally
      AMnsqNSCLC without sensitizing EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations were
      randomly assigned to sintilimab + pemetrexed-platinum (n = 266) or placebo +
      pemetrexed-platinum (n = 131). Patients were stratified by PD-L1 expression,
      platinum-chemotherapy, and gender. Treatment continued until PD, unacceptable
      toxicity, or a maximum of 24 months. Patients in the placebo +
      pemetrexed-platinum arm could be sequenced to second-line sintilimab monotherapy,
      contingent upon PD. Response was assessed (RECISTv.1.1) by blinded independent
      radiographic review committee. Primary endpoint was PFS. OS was a secondary
      endpoint and defined from date of randomization to date of death due to any
      cause. Final OS analysis was defined as approximately 2 years after last patient 
      randomized or when approximately 65 % of patients died, whichever first. RESULTS:
      At data cutoff of final OS analysis, median study follow-up was 30.8 months. Of
      397 patients, 243 OS events were observed (sintilimab +
      pemetrexed-platinum:151[57 %];placebo + pemetrexed-platinum:92 [70 %]). Of the
      patients in placebo + pemetrexed-platinum arm, 47 % crossed over to sintilimab
      monotherapy per protocol. Median OS was 24.2 months in sintilimab +
      pemetrexed-platinum arm and 16.8 months in placebo + pemetrexed-platinum arm
      (HR:0.65[95 % CI:0.50,0.85]). Estimated 2-year OS rates were 50 %(sintilimab +
      pemetrexed-platinum) and 32 %(placebo + pemetrexed-platinum). After adjusting for
      the crossover effect, OS treatment effect was more pronounced with HR 0.52 (95 % 
      CI:0.38,0.69). OS benefit across all prespecified subgroups was largely
      consistent with that observed in the ITT population. CONCLUSIONS: In the
      ORIENT-11 final OS analysis, sintilimab + pemetrexed-platinum demonstrated
      improved OS compared to placebo + pemetrexed-platinum when administered as
      first-line therapy in AMnsqNSCLC without EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the clinical features, prognosis and
      predictive factors for the non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with
      uncertain resection [R(un)]. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Kaplan-Meier method with a
      log-rank test was used to compare overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival
      (DFS) between groups. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator
      (LASSO)-penalized Cox multivariable analysis was used to identify the prognostic 
      factors. Random forest was used to determine the important predictive factors of 
      R(un) resection. RESULTS: A total of 2,782 eligible cases (R0 group: 1,897 cases;
      R(un) group: 885 cases) were included in this study. The rate of conventional R0 
      to R(un) reclassification was 31.8%. Patients with R(un) resection were more
      likely to have left-sided tumors, receive open surgery, and be diagnosed with
      advanced tumors. The survivals of the patients with R(un) resection were inferior
      to those of the patients with R0 resection in the entire cohort and in the nodal 
      category, histology and adjuvant therapy subgroups. The LASSO-penalized
      multivariable Cox analysis confirmed that R(un) resection was an adverse
      prognostic factor for both OS and DFS. At last, surgical extent, surgical
      approach and tumor location were proven as the predictive factors for R(un)
      resection. CONCLUSION: NSCLC patients with R(un) resection was not rare. R(un)
      had an adverse impact on the survivals of resected patients. Patients received
      non-lobectomy and open surgery, and patients with left-sided tumors were more
      likely to be suffered from R(un) resection.

AB  - PARP inhibitors (PARPi) are currently used as first-line therapy for advanced and
      recurrent ovarian cancer, but the clinical efficacy is limited by drug
      resistance. We aimed to investigate the role of KIAA1529 in PARPi resistance in
      ovarian cancer. The expression of KIAA1529 was determined in ovarian cancer cells
      using qRTPCR and western blotting. Immunohistochemistry was used to examine the
      expression of KIAA1529 in primary ovarian cancer and recurrent ovarian cancer
      tissues. The effects of KIAA1529 on PARPi resistance were evaluated by knocking
      down KIAA1529 expression in ovarian cancer cells and assessing cell viability by 
      CCK8 assays, apoptosis by flow cytometry, and homologous recombination (HR)
      repair by immunofluorescence analysis. The interaction between KIAA1529 and RAD51
      was examined by western blotting. KIAA1529 was confirmed to be expressed in all
      ovarian cancer cell lines, and high expression of KIAA1529 was observed in
      recurrent ovarian cancer tissues. Inhibiting KIAA1529 expression increased the
      sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells to PARPi treatment. Furthermore, KIAA1529
      increased the expression of the downstream effector RAD51 via Aurora-A, and HR
      was restored in ovarian cancer cells. This study demonstrates that KIAA1529
      regulates RAD51 expression through Aurora-A to restore HR, which confers
      resistance to PARPi in ovarian cancer cells. These findings could provide a novel
      therapeutic target to overcome PARPi resistance in ovarian cancer.

AB  - Enzalutamide is a second-generation anti-androgen which has shown increased
      survival in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. However, some patients do
      not respond to this therapy or will develop resistance to treatment over time.
      Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) is known to be
      involved in castration-resistant prostate cancer and to interact with androgen
      receptor (AR)-signaling. This study aims to investigate the combination
      enzalutamide and the small molecule STAT3 inhibitor GPB730 for enhanced
      therapeutic effect in advanced prostate cancer in vitro. The prostate cancer cell
      lines LNCaP (androgen dependent) and C4-2 (androgen insensitive) were used. The
      effect of enzalutamide and GPB730, alone and in combination, was investigated on 
      viability and IC50 values calculated. Enzalutamide and GPB730 treated LNCaP and
      C4-2 cells were subjected to western blot and QPCR analyses in order to
      investigate the expression of AR, STAT3 and down-stream targets. C4-2 were less
      sensitive to growth inhibition by enzalutamide than LNCaP cells. GPB730 enhanced 
      the growth inhibitory effect of enzalutamide in LNCaP and C4-2 cells. The
      addition of GPB730 to enzalutamide decreased the IC50 values for enzalutamide by 
      3.3-fold for LNCaP and by 12-fold for C4-2. In C4-2 cells, GPB730 alone decreased
      PSA expression and enhanced the enzalutamide induced decrease in NKX3.1
      expression. GPB730 and enzalutamide in combination enhanced inhibition of c-myc
      and survivin expression. This study suggests that enzalutamide may be combined
      with the STAT3 inhibitor GPB730 in order to enhance the efficacy of enzalutamide,
      offering a new therapeutic approach in advanced prostate cancer.

AB  - Increasing evidence has indicated that long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) play
      multiple functions in the development of cancer and function as indicators of
      diagnosis and prognosis. This aim of this study was to investigate the roles
      LncRNA C9orF139 had in the progression of esophageal squamous carcinoma (ESCC).
      We found C9orf139 was highly expressed in ESCC and knock down the expression of
      C9orf139 significantly suppressed cell proliferation, promoted apoptosis, and
      inhibited migration and invasion. C9orf139 was able to negatively regulate
      miR-661 expression. At the same time, HDAC11 expression was negatively regulated 
      by miR-661. The C9orf139/miR-661/HDAC11 axis was further involved in regulating
      the expression of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. The association between the
      C9orf139 knockdown and the reduced tumor growth and size was observed during in
      vivo study. C9orf139 is highly expressed in ESCC, and is thus qualified to be
      used as a potential diagnostic and prognostic marker for ESCC. Its promotion of
      ESCC progression is achieved by mediating the miR-661/HDAC11 axis.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Characterizing the tumor microenvironment (TME) and immune
      landscape of cancer has been a promising step towards discovering new therapeutic
      biomarkers and guiding precision medicine; however, its application in
      mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) has been sparse. Here, we conducted a
      comprehensive study to understand the properties of the TME and immune profiles
      of MEC. METHOD: 20 patients with MEC were collected from Yonsei Head and Neck
      Cancer Centre, Yonsei University, South Korea. Total RNA sequencing was conducted
      to determine gene expression profiles. Bioinformatic and immunoinformatic
      analyses were applied to characterize the TME and identify immunophenotypic
      subgroups, and to investigate the molecular features that explain the distinct
      phenotypes. RESULTS: The MEC samples were subdivided into two groups, immune hot 
      and immune cold, based on the heterogenous immune cell-infiltration and
      activation level. The immune-hot subgroup exhibited a higher level of immune
      activity, including T cell infiltration, cytolytic score, IFN-gamma,
      antigen-presenting machinery, and immune modulator genes. Further characterizing 
      molecular features of two subgroups, downregulation of lipid metabolic
      regulators, including MLXIPL and FASN, and the migration of chemokines and
      leukocytes were observed, respectively. And, Group-specific expression of immune 
      checkpoint molecules, such as TIGIT, PD-L2, and CTLA-4, was observed in the
      immune-hot group, which can be exploited as a potential immunotherapeutic
      biomarker. CONCLUSIONS: Immunophenotypically heterogeneous MEC subgroups analysis
      has shown distinctive molecular characteristics and provided potential treatment 
      options. These findings yield new insights into TME of MEC and may help next step
      to study this uncharted cancer.

AB  - It is known that biomechanical and structural properties of tumor tissues are
      potential biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of tumors such as
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Although there are many studies on the
      characterization of biomechanical properties of HCC at the cellular level,
      limited information is known from in vitro studies. Here, tissue samples from 14 
      patients diagnosed with HCC were analyzed. Indentation tests showed the
      instantaneous shear modulus and long-term shear modulus of the HCC tissue were
      1.19 +/- 0.86 kPa and 0.29 +/- 0.25 kPa, respectively. The volume fraction of
      collagen fibers estimated by analyzing the histology images was positively
      correlated with either instantaneous shear modulus (r = 0.64, p = 0.016) or
      long-term shear modulus (r = 0.76, p = 0.002). Diffusion-weighted images with
      13b-values were also collected and the diffusivity from Intravoxel Incoherent
      Motion (IVIM) and Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging (DKI) models were 1.09 +/- 0.47
      10(-3) mm(2)/s and 2.06 +/- 0.8310(-3) mm(2)/s, respectively. Significant
      positive correlations were observed between long-term shear modulus and the
      diffusivity estimated from IVIM (r = 0.600, p = 0.026). The shifted apparent
      diffusion coefficient (ADC) estimated based on b = 600 and 2000 s/mm(2) was
      negatively correlated with both instantaneous shear modulus (r = -0.745, p =
      0.003) and long-term shear modulus (r = -0.591, p = 0.029). In addition, the
      diffusivity and non-Gaussian Kurtosis parameters estimated at different b values 
      showed a significant negative correlation (r = -0.675, p = 0.010). Results
      revealed the close relationships between the structural and biomechanical
      properties of HCC tissue. The interrelation of diffusion and biomechanical
      properties are not only crucial for HCC characterization but could also provide
      helpful information for HCC diagnosis and prognosis.

AB  - Natural products have greatly influenced the development of drugs to combat
      infectious diseases, cancer, and other disorders affecting human well-being. Only
      rarely, a natural product is used in an unmodified form for therapeutic purposes.
      More often, natural product derivatives are preferred due to improved activity or
      toxicity profiles. These compounds are usually produced using 'hybrid' processes 
      that integrate organic synthesis and biosynthesis. Either a natural product is
      isolated from a biological source and then converted into the final drug by
      semisynthesis or a synthetically prepared precursor is introduced into the
      engineered biosynthesis of a living cell in a procedure called mutasynthesis. In 
      this review, we will present recent developments in these two research areas,
      which take advantage of heterologous biosynthesis.

LID - 10.1093/carcin/bgac068 [doi]
AB  - Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women and is cause mortality in many
      countries. The purpose of this article is to determine the BRCA1 BRCA2 gene
      mutation polymorphisms, as well as to determine the clinical, histopathological
      and prognostic characteristics in patients with breast cancer in the western
      region of Kazakhstan. A study was conducted on the genotyping of 278 patients in 
      the MC ZKMU Marat Ospanov with an established diagnosis of breast cancer, which
      revealed that out of 278 patients, of 3 cases were identified. In the age
      category up to 50 years, 70 cases were detected (25.1%) after 50 years 208 cases 
      were identified (74%). Number of patients in stage I was 20 (7.1%) in stage
      second 204 (73%) and in stage third 54 (19%). By tumor size, 30(10%) cases were
      T1, 194 (69%) cases were T2, 35 (12.5%) cases were T3, and 19 cases were T4
      (6.8%). According to metastasis of the lymph nodes, no lymph nodes were detected 
      in 107 (38%) cases, 1-3 L/n (Lymph Nodes) in 95 (34%) cases, 4-9 L/n in 12 (4%)
      cases, 10 L/n in 4 (1.4%) cases and unknown cases was 60 (21%). In 99.6% of
      patients no distant metastases was detected. According to the molecular
      classification of the tumor, Luminal type A is most found in this study 147
      (52.8%), then Luminal type B 57 (20.5%), HER-2 positive 26 (9.3%) and Triple
      negative 48 (17.2%). By ethnicity the Kazakh race is 182 (65%) the Caucasian race
      was 96 (34%). Large population screening studies involving all BRCA1/2
      polymorphisms are required to confirm the penetrance, frequency and significance 
      of a wide range of variations of BRCA1/2 genes in the Kazakh population.

AB  - Targeted therapy with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) such as imatinib is
      effective in treating gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), but it is rarely
      curative. Despite the presence of a robust immune CD8+ T-cell infiltrate,
      combining a TKI with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in advanced GIST has
      achieved only modest effects. To identify limitations imposed by imatinib on the 
      antitumor immune response, we performed bulk RNA sequencing (RNAseq), single-cell
      RNAseq, and flow cytometry to phenotype CD8+ T-cell subsets in a genetically
      engineered mouse model of GIST. Imatinib reduced the frequency of effector CD8+ T
      cells and increased the frequency of naive CD8+ T cells within mouse GIST, which 
      coincided with altered tumor chemokine production, CD8+ T-cell recruitment, and
      reduced CD8+ T-cell intracellular PI3K signaling. Imatinib also failed to induce 
      intratumoral T-cell receptor (TCR) clonal expansion. Consistent with these
      findings, human GISTs sensitive to imatinib harbored fewer effector CD8+ T cells 
      but more naive CD8+ T cells. Combining an IL15 superagonist (IL15SA) with
      imatinib restored intratumoral effector CD8+ T-cell function and CD8+ T-cell
      intracellular PI3K signaling, resulting in greater tumor destruction. Combination
      therapy with IL15SA and ICB resulted in the greatest tumor killing and maintained
      an effector CD8+ T-cell population in the presence of imatinib. Our findings
      highlight the impact of oncogene inhibition on intratumoral CD8+ T cells and
      support the use of agonistic T-cell therapy during TKI and/or ICB administration.

LID - bgac067 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/carcin/bgac067 [doi]
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in cancer proliferation, metastasis,
      drug resistance and apoptosis by targeting oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes.
      miR-3154 has been reported to be up-regulated in cervical cancer and leukemia,
      but its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. Here, we for the 
      first time demonstrated that miR-3154 was elevated in HCC and liver cancer stem
      cells (CSCs). Up-regulated miR-3154 was associated with overall survival and
      disease-free survival of HCC patients. MiR-3154 knockdown inhibits HCC cells
      self-renewal, proliferation, metastasis and tumorigenesis. Mechanistically,
      miR-3154 target directly to HNF4alpha. MiR-3154 knockdown upregulated HNF4alpha
      mRNA and protein expression. HNF4alpha interference abolish the differences of
      self-renewal, proliferation, metastasis and tumorigenesis between miR-3154
      knockdown cells and control hepatoma cells. Further, miR-3154 expression was
      negatively correlated with HNF4alpha in HCC tissues. The combined HHC panels
      exhibited a better disease-free survival prognostic value for HCC patients than
      any of these components alone. More importantly, miR-3154 determines the
      responses of hepatoma cells to lenvatinib treatment. Analysis of patient cohort
      and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) further suggest that miR-3154 might predict
      lenvatinib clinical benefit in HCC patients. In conclusion, we reveal the crucial
      role of miR-3514 in HCC progression and lenvatinib response, suggesting potential
      therapeutic targets for HCC.

      myeloma.
LID - bloodadvances.2022007875 [pii]

AB  - Proteasome inhibition is a highly effective treatment for multiple myeloma (MM). 
      However, virtually all patients develop proteasome inhibitor resistance which is 
      associated with a poor prognosis. Hyperactive SUMO signaling is involved in both 
      cancer pathogenesis and cancer progression. A state of increased SUMOylation has 
      been associated with aggressive cancer biology. We found that relapsed/refractory
      MM is characterized by a SUMO-high state, and high expression of the SUMO E1
      activating enzyme (SAE1/UBA2) is associated with poor overall survival.
      Consistently, continuous treatment of MM cell lines with carfilzomib (CFZ)
      enhanced SUMO pathway activity. Treatment of MM cell lines with the SUMO E1
      activating enzyme inhibitor subasumstat (TAK-981) showed synergy with CFZ in both
      CFZ-sensitive and CFZ-resistant MM cell lines, irrespective of the TP53 state.
      Combination therapy was effective in primary MM cells and in two murine MM
      xenograft models. Mechanistically, combination treatment with subasumstat and CFZ
      enhanced genotoxic and proteotoxic stress and induced apoptosis was associated
      with activity of the prolyl isomerase PIN1. In summary, our findings reveal
      activated SUMOylation as a therapeutic target in MM and point to combined
      SUMO/proteasome inhibition as a novel and potent strategy for the treatment of
      proteasome inhibitor-resistant MM.

TI  - Relationship Between Sexual Orientation and Human Papillomavirus-Related Oral
      Cancer Knowledge and Awareness.
LID - 10.1089/lgbt.2021.0146 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related oral cancers are increasing, and
      lesbian, gay, bisexual, and other people with a minority sexual orientation may
      be disproportionately impacted. This study examined the relationship between
      sexual orientation and HPV-related oral cancer knowledge. Methods: Data from
      10,859 adult participants in the 2017-2019 Health Information National Trends
      Survey 5, cycles 1-3, were obtained. The three data sets were merged, and
      weighted multiple imputation (n = 15) was applied to address missingness.
      Weighted logistic regression analyses examined differences in HPV-related oral
      cancer knowledge between sexual minority versus heterosexual participants by sex,
      after adjustment for race, ethnicity, age, education, income, insurance, regular 
      medical provider, and smoking status. Results: In this weighted sample, age
      ranged from 18 to 101 years (mean = 56.3 years); 42% were males, 5.2% were sexual
      minority men/women, and 94.8% were heterosexual/straight. Overall, only 19% of
      respondents were aware that HPV can cause oral cancer. After controlling for
      sociodemographic factors, there were no significant differences in HPV-related
      oral cancer knowledge for sexual minority men (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 1.10;
      95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.86-1.42) or women (AOR: 0.98; 95% CI:
      0.76-1.26) compared with those who were heterosexual/straight. Conclusion:
      Overall, knowledge of HPV-related oral cancer was low, regardless of sexual
      orientation. There were no differences in HPV-related oral cancer knowledge
      between sexual minority men and women compared with their heterosexual
      counterparts. Educational programs are needed to increase awareness of the
      HPV/oral cancer link. Further research on differences in HPV-related oral cancer 
      knowledge and attitudes by sexual orientation and the intersection of other
      demographic factors is warranted.

TI  - An Arts-Based Workshop Using Scalp Tattoos to Connect Students with Cancer
      Patients' Experiences of Chemotherapy and Hair Loss.
PG  - 1160-1163
LID - 10.1097/ACM.0000000000004705 [doi]
AB  - PROBLEM: Students eager to enter the medical field must develop
      perspective-taking skills that enhance their ability to connect with patients.
      Toward this goal, the authors developed a pilot workshop for undergraduate
      students that included an art activity during which they collaborated to design
      scalp tattoos to symbolize cancer patients' experiences with chemotherapy and
      hair loss. APPROACH: A 90-minute, arts-based workshop was held in April 2019. One
      author selected anonymous excerpts from previously conducted interviews with
      patients experiencing ovarian and uterine cancer. These excerpts were shared with
      students to humanize patients' perspectives and give context to the difficulty of
      coping with chemotherapy-induced alopecia. Students discussed these excerpts and 
      images of scalp tattoos from the internet. Together, they then designed scalp
      tattoos representing their perspective on the experience of coping with
      chemotherapy and hair loss and drew them onto mannequin heads. OUTCOMES: Twenty
      members of the university community participated in this workshop, including 3
      faculty members and 17 undergraduate students. Participants worked together to
      create 2 sets of scalp tattoos. Of the 20 participants, 75% (n = 15) responded to
      the postworkshop survey. All respondents were undergraduate students, and 73% (n 
      = 11) reported an increase in empathy toward patients and 87% (n = 13) an
      increased connection with the patient experience. All respondents agreed that the
      art activity demonstrated the importance of taking the patient's perspective.
      NEXT STEPS: This arts-based workshop is effective and can be replicated for other
      audiences, including undergraduate students, medical students, and practicing
      clinicians, to encourage perspective-taking and compassion for patients. Further 
      analysis of students' skill development using pre- and postworkshop data is
      needed.

TI  - Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists for ovarian protection during breast
      cancer chemotherapy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
LID - 10.1097/GME.0000000000002019 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: The increasing trend of delaying childbirth means that more women are
      being diagnosed with breast cancer before having given birth to their desired
      number of children. Although chemotherapy can significantly improve the prognosis
      of this population, it also causes ovarian damage, including premature ovarian
      insufficiency and infertility. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa)
      have shown promising fertility protective activity in premenopausal women, but
      their clinical usage remains controversial. OBJECTIVE: Here, we conducted a
      meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of GnRHa when administered concurrently with
      chemotherapy that included cyclophosphamide in the prevention of
      chemotherapy-induced ovarian damage in premenopausal women. EVIDENCE REVIEW: An
      extensive literature search was performed using the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane 
      databases. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were
      determined. FINDINGS: Eleven randomized controlled trials with a total of 1,219
      participants were included in the analyses. A significantly higher number of
      women treated with GnRHa experienced the resumption of ovarian function after
      chemotherapy than those who did not receive this treatment (OR, 3.04; 95% CI,
      1.87-4.94; P < 0.001). Regarding spontaneous pregnancy, a statistically
      significant difference was observed only in hormone receptor-negative
      participants (OR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.03-4.11; P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: 
      When treating premenopausal women with breast cancer, the administration of GnRHa
      concurrently with chemotherapy appeared to improve the resumption rate of ovarian
      function; however, the spontaneous pregnancy rate only improved in hormone
      receptor-negative patients. Thus, the use of GnRHa during chemotherapy may
      represent a feasible strategy for preserving ovarian function in women with
      breast cancer.
